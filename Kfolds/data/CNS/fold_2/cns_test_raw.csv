2772,"Effects on the photoresponse of calcium buffers and cyclic GMP incorporated into the cytoplasm of retinal rods It is generally accepted that the light response in retinal rods involves a reduction of ionic permeability (predominantly to Na+) in the plasma membrane of the outer segment and that this is mediated by an internal messenger which diffuses between the disk and plasma membranes. There is controversy, however, over the identity of the diffusible substance; two alternative schemes have received widespread support (for review see refs 1,2). According to the 'calcium hypothesis', light stimulates the release into the cytoplasm of calcium, leading to the blockage of channels which are normally open in darkness, whereas based on the 'cyclic nucleotide hypothesis', cyclic GMP causes the opening of channels in the dark, but is hydrolysed by a light-activated phosphodiesterase. We report here effects of introducing calcium buffers and cyclic GMP into the rod cytoplasm by means of a patch pipette, which seem to be inconsistent with the calcium hypothesis.",Excluded
3078,"[The protocol of dose reduction in liver perfusion computed tomography] Cerebral perfusion computed tomography (CT) has been widespread, but abdominal perfusion CT has not been very popular because there has been a problem with regard to the limit of irradiation range and respiratory effects. Recently, it became easy to perform perfusion of abdominal organs because the use of multi detector row CT (MDCT) has been extensive. Along with it, the number of hospitals that perform liver perfusion CT has increased. However, patient dose of the liver perfusion CT is very high, making it very important to reduce patient dose. We created the virtual data that reduced the number of irradiation by partly reducing the data obtained on the liver perfusion CT. We compared the analysis results of all data with that of the partly reduced. It is possible to reduce the patient dose by reducing the number of irradiation because there was no significant difference in the analysis results.",Excluded
3601,"Longitudinal Analysis of Quantitative Brain MRI in Astronauts Following Microgravity Exposure BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Assessment of the effects of microgravity on astronauts' brains using microstructural measures by utilizing quantitative MRI, before and after spaceflight would help understand the structural changes.METHODS: Quantitative MRI data sets in 19 astronauts were acquired before and after space missions. Both diffusion tensor metrics and volumetric measures were analyzed in the brain regions involved in the visual function.RESULTS: The fractional anisotropy was reduced in the right posterior thalamic radiations (P = .0009) and remained significant after a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (P = .03). A trend of increase in the mean diffusivities of different subregions of the occipital cortex on the right side, including calcarine, middle occipital, inferior occipital, and fusiform gyri, was noted and became insignificant after FDR correction. Similarly, there was a trend of cortical thinning involving the right occipital lobe and bilateral fusiform gyri, volume reduction of the left thalamus, and increase in lateral ventricular volume in the postflight scans.CONCLUSION: Gray and white matter alterations are detected by quantitative MRI before and after space flight. Our findings may be used to understand the neuroanatomical mechanisms of possible brain dysfunction or neuroplasticity in microgravity condition in the future studies.",Excluded
2733,"125Iodine implants as an adjuvant to surgery and external beam radiotherapy in the management of locally advanced head and neck cancer 125Iodine seeds either individually placed or inserted into absorbable Vicryl suture carriers were utilized in conjunction with surgery and external beam radiotherapy in an attempt to increase local control rates in patients with (1) advanced oropharyngeal and laryngopharyngeal cancers (T3-T4, N2-N3), (2) massive cervical lymphadenopathy (N3) and an unknown primary site and (3) locally recurrent head and neck cancers. Forty-eight patients were treated with 55 implants. The carotid artery was implanted in 15 patients, while seven patients had seeds inserted into the base of the skull region, and another three patients had implants near cranial nerves. Eighteen of the 48 patients were treated for cure. The actuarial survival at five years in this subgroup was 50%. The overall local control in the head and neck area was 58%. In this group no patients to date have had a local failure in the implanted volume. Seventeen patients with comparable stage of disease treated prior to 1974 with curative intent without 125I implants were analyzed retrospectively for comparison with the implanted patients. The actuarial survival of these patients was 18% and the overall head and neck control was 21%. These differences are statistically significant at a P value of 0.01 and 0.007, respectively. Seventeen patients received implants for local recurrence. The local control in the head and neck area was 50%; however, the 2.5 year actuarial survival was only 17%. The complication rate was 11% (six of 55 implants). The improved survival, the high local control, and the minimal complication rates in this series makes the intraoperative implantation of 125I seeds and effective adjunctive treatment to surgery and external beam irradiation.",Excluded
3568,"Pulsed radio-frequency electromagnetic fields: dose-dependent effects on sleep, the sleep EEG and cognitive performance To establish a dose-response relationship between the strength of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and previously reported effects on the brain, we investigated the influence of EMF exposure by varying the signal intensity in three experimental sessions. The head of 15 healthy male subjects was unilaterally exposed for 30 min prior to sleep to a pulse-modulated EMF (GSM handset like signal) with a 10 g-averaged peak spatial specific absorption rate of (1) 0.2 W kg(-1), (2) 5 W kg(-1), or (3) sham exposed in a double-blind, crossover design. During exposure, subjects performed two series of three computerized cognitive tasks, each presented in a fixed order [simple reaction time task, two-choice reaction time task (CRT), 1-, 2-, 3-back task]. Immediately after exposure, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded for 8 h. Sleep architecture was not affected by EMF exposure. Analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a dose-dependent increase of power in the spindle frequency range in non-REM sleep. Reaction speed decelerated with increasing field intensity in the 1-back task, while accuracy in the CRT and N-back task were not affected in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study reveals first indications of a dose-response relationship between EMF field intensity and its effects on brain physiology as demonstrated by changes in the sleep EEG and in cognitive performance.",Excluded
3388,"Coding of Azimuthal Directions via Time-Compensated Combination of Celestial Compass Cues Many animals use the sun as a reference for spatial orientation [1-3]. In addition to sun position, the sky provides two other sources of directional information, a color gradient [4] and a polarization pattern [5]. Work on insects has predominantly focused on celestial polarization as an orientation cue [6, 7]. Relying on sky polarization alone, however, poses the following two problems: E vector orientations in the sky are not suited to distinguish between the solar and antisolar hemisphere of the sky, and the polarization pattern changes with changing solar elevation during the day [8, 9]. Here, we present neurons that overcome both problems in a locust's brain. The spiking activity of these neurons depends (1) on the E vector orientation of dorsally presented polarized light, (2) on the azimuthal, i.e., horizontal, direction, and (3) on the wavelength of an unpolarized light source. Their tuning to these stimuli matches the distribution of a UV/green chromatic contrast as well as the polarization of natural skylight and compensates for changes in solar elevation during the day. The neurons are, therefore, suited to code for solar azimuth by concurrent combination of signals from the spectral gradient, intensity gradient, and polarization pattern of the sky. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2949,"Comparison of the extent of hippocampal sparing according to the tilt of a patient's head during WBRT using linear accelerator-based IMRT and VMAT In this paper, we report the results of our investigation into whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) using linear accelerator-based intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in lung cancer patients with a high risk of metastasis to the brain. Specifically, we assessed the absorbed dose and the rate of adverse effects for several organs at risk (OAR), including the hippocampus, according to the tilt of a patient's head. We arbitrarily selected five cases where measurements were made with the patients' heads tilted forward and five cases without such tilt. We set the entire brain as the planning target volume (PTV), and the hippocampi, the lenses, the eyes, and the cochleae as the main OAR, and formulated new plans for IMRT (coplanar, non-coplanar) and VMAT (coplanar, non-coplanar). Using the dose-volume histogram (DVH), we calculated and compared the effective uniform dose (EUD), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of the OAR and the mean and the maximum doses of hippocampus. As a result, if the patient tilted the head forward when receiving the Linac-based treatment, for the same treatment effect in the PTV, we confirmed that a lower dose entered the OAR, such as the hippocampus, eye, lens, and cochlea. Moreover, the damage to the hippocampus was expected to be the least when receiving coplanar VMAT with the head tilted forward. Accordingly, if patients tilt their heads forward when undergoing Linac-based WBRT, we anticipate that a smaller dose would be transmitted to the OAR, resulting in better quality of life following treatment.",Excluded
2952,"Regulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis after brain irradiation PURPOSE: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels seen after radiation treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE2 production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE2 production and PGES expression.RESULTS: As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE2 levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE2 seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE2 production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.",Included
2560,"Adjuvant treatment of brain metastases With an incidence of 15/10<sup>5</sup> in the general population, brain metastases constitute a serious, debilitating complication in cancer patients. The majority of those patients suffer from more than one metastasis, but up to 30% to 40% present with a solitary lesion. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) extends median survival from 1 to 2 months for treatment with steroids only, to 4 to 6 months in most series. However, long-term survival (>1-2 years) is observed in up to 10% of patients with favorable prognostic factors, such as solitary lesions, good Karnofsky performance status, and absence of extracranial disease. For those patients, individually optimized treatment is worthwhile. For good-prognosis patients with controlled extracranial disease, surgery in combination with postoperative WBRT should be considered, especially when fast relief of symptoms is mandated. For surgically inaccessible solitary lesions below a size threshold of approximately 30 ccm, stereotactic radiosurgery (RS), although never compared to surgery in a randomized fashion, seems to yield comparable results and is the treatment of choice for more than one lesion in appropriately selected patients. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning the optimal treatment regimens for brain metastases remain. These mainly concern the radiation dose, need for a combination of RS and WBRT, relative timing of different treatment modalities, and maximum number of brain metastases that can reasonably be treated with RS when long-term progression-free survival is the goal. However, RS is definitely an excellent option for salvage and palliation in patients with short life expectancy, as it is simultaneously noninvasive and cost-effective, with short hospitalization times. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
3305,"Olfactory neuroblastoma following treatment for pituitary adenoma Olfactory neuroblastoma is extremely rare as a second neoplasm. We report an unusual case of olfactory neuroblastoma in a 59-year-old woman who had undergone two operations and received 54 Gy of irradiation for pituitary adenoma 20 years ago. At the time of admission, the patient presented with nasal obstruction and frequent epistaxis. Imaging studies showed a large mass in the nasal cavities and ethmoid sinus, extending to the intracranial area, with no evidence of any recurrence of the previous pituitary adenoma. The tumor was completely excised via a trans-cranial and trans-nasal approach. A diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma was established, and the patient was given postoperative chemotherapy. Although relatively uncommon, second neoplasms are an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of patients with new or recurring symptoms after treatment for pituitary adenoma. Furthermore, it is likely that radiation played a critical role in the development of olfactory neuroblastoma in our patient.",Excluded
3459,"[Radiation-induced neuropathies: collateral damage of improved cancer prognosis] INTRODUCTION: Because of the improvement of cancer prognosis, long-term damages of treatments become a medical and public health problem. Among the iatrogenic complications, neurological impairment is crucial to consider since motor disability and pain have a considerable impact on quality of life of long cancer survivors. However, radiation-induced neuropathies have not been the focus of great attention. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated review about the radiation-induced lesions of the peripheral nerve system.STATE OF THE ART: Radiation-induced neuropathies are characterized by their heterogeneity in both symptoms and disease course. Signs and symptoms depend on the affected structures of the peripheral nerve system (nerve roots, nerve plexus or nerve trunks). Early-onset complications are often transient and late complications are usually progressive and associated with a poor prognosis. The most frequent and well known is delayed radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, which may follow breast cancer irradiation. Radiation-induced lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy is characterized by pure or predominant lower motor neuron signs. They can be misdiagnosed, confused with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or with leptomeningeal metastases since nodular MRI enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content can be observed. In the absence of specific markers of the link with radiotherapy, the diagnosis of post-radiation neuropathy may be difficult. Recently, a posteriori conformal radiotherapy with 3D dosimetric reconstitution has been developed to link a precise anatomical site to unexpected excess irradiation.PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION: The importance of early diagnosis of radiation-induced neuropathies is underscored by the emergence of new disease-modifying treatments. Although the pathophysiology is not fully understood, it is already possible to target radiation-induced fibrosis but also associated factors such as ischemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. A phase III trial evaluating the association of pentoxifylline, tocopherol and clodronate (PENTOCLO, NCT01291433) in radiation-induced neuropathies is now recruiting.",Excluded
2811,"Angiogenic response of rat hippocampal vasculature to focused ultrasound-mediated increases in blood-brain barrier permeability Focused ultrasound (FUS) and circulating microbubbles can induce a targeted and transient increase in blood-brain barrier permeability. While preclinical research has demonstrated the utility of FUS for efficacious drug deliver to the brain, there remain gaps in our knowledge regarding the long-term response of brain vasculature to this intervention. Previous work has demonstrated transcriptional changes in hippocampal microvessels following sonication that are indicative of the initiation of angiogenic processes. Moreover, blood vessel growth has been reported in skeletal muscle following application of FUS and microbubbles. The current study demonstrates that blood vessel density in the rat hippocampus is modestly elevated at 7 and 14 d post-FUS compared to the contralateral hemisphere (7 d: 10.9 +/- 6.0%, p = 0.02; 14 d: 12.1 +/- 3.2%, p < 0.01), but returns to baseline by 21 d (5.9 +/- 2.6%, p = 0.12). Concurrently, relative newborn endothelial cell density and frequency of small blood vessel segments were both elevated in the sonicated hippocampus. While further work is required to determine the mechanisms driving these changes, the findings presented here may have relevance to the optimal frequency of repeated treatments.",Excluded
3374,"MRI-Guided Ultrafocal HDR Brachytherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Median 4-Year Results of a feasibility study PURPOSE: For the treatment of localized prostate cancer, focal therapy has the potential to cure with fewer side effects than traditional whole-gland treatments. We report an update on toxicity, quality of life (QoL), and tumor control in our magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy cohort.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Disease status was evaluated by systematic biopsies and 3T multiparametric MRI. The brachytherapy implant procedure under fused transrectal ultrasound/MRI guidance was followed by a 1.5 T MRI for contour adjustments and catheter position verification. A single dose of 19 Gy was delivered to the tumor with a margin of 5 mm. Genitourinary (GU) toxicity, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, and erectile dysfunction (ED) were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. QoL was measured with RAND-36, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and PR25. International Prostate Symptom Scores and International Index of Erectile Function scores were obtained. Prostate-specific antigen level was monitored, with biochemical recurrence defined as nadir + 2 ng/mL (Phoenix).RESULTS: Thirty patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low- (13%) to intermediate-risk (87%) prostate cancer were treated between May 2013 and April 2016. Median follow-up was 4 years. Median age was 71 years (interquartile range, 68-73) and median initial prostate-specific antigen level was 7.3 ng/mL (5.2-8.1). Maximum Gleason score was 4 + 3 = 7 (in 2 patients). All tumors were radiologic (MRI) stage T2. No grade >2 GU or >1 GI toxicity occurred. International Prostate Symptom Scores only deteriorated temporarily. Mild pretreatment ED deteriorated to moderate/severe ED in 50% of patients. Long-term clinically relevant QoL deterioration was seen in sexual activity and tiredness, whereas emotional and cognitive functioning improved. At 4 years, biochemical disease-free survival was 70% (95% confidence interval, 52%-93%), metastases-free survival was 93% (85%-100%), and overall survival was 100%. Of intraprostatic recurrences, 7 of 9 were out of field.CONCLUSIONS: Ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy conveys minimal GU or GI toxicity and has a marginal effect on QoL. An early decline in erectile function was seen. Tumor control outcomes are poor (biochemical disease-free survival of 70% [52%-93%] at 4 years), most likely as a result of poor patient selection.",Excluded
3050,"Dark light, rod saturation, and the absolute and incremental sensitivity of mouse cone vision Visual thresholds of mice for the detection of small, brief targets were measured with a novel behavioral methodology in the dark and in the presence of adapting lights spanning ~8 log(10) units of intensity. To help dissect the contributions of rod and cone pathways, both wild-type mice and mice lacking rod (Gnat1(-/-)) or cone (Gnat2(cpfl3)) function were studied. Overall, the visual sensitivity of mice was found to be remarkably similar to that of the human peripheral retina. Rod absolute threshold corresponded to 12-15 isomerized pigment molecules (R*) in image fields of 800 to 3000 rods. Rod ""dark light"" (intrinsic retinal noise in darkness) corresponded to that estimated previously from single-cell recordings, 0.012 R* s(-1) rod(-1), indicating that spontaneous thermal isomerizations are responsible. Psychophysical rod saturation was measured for the first time in a nonhuman species and found to be very similar to that of the human rod monochromat. Cone threshold corresponded to ~5 R* cone(-1) in an image field of 280 cones. Cone dark light was equivalent to ~5000 R* s(-1) cone(-1), consistent with primate single-cell data but 100-fold higher than predicted by recent measurements of the rate of thermal isomerization of mouse cone opsins, indicating that nonopsin sources of noise determine cone threshold. The new, fully automated behavioral method is based on the ability of mice to learn to interrupt spontaneous wheel running on the presentation of a visual cue and provides an efficient and highly reliable means of examining visual function in naturally behaving normal and mutant mice.",Excluded
3593,"Locally recurrent breast cancer: Pulse dose rate brachytherapy for repeat irradiation following lumpectomy - A second chance to preserve the breast Purpose: To perform and assess the effectiveness of local excision of recurrent tumor followed by postoperative pulse dose rate (PDR) brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): From 1994 to 2000, 17 patients who had small recurrent breast carcinomas after initially undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT), which included postoperative radiation therapy, were treated with local tumor excision and PDR brachytherapy. Recurrences occurred at a median time of 50 months (range, 11-208 months) after primary treatment. Eight patients underwent a combination of PDR brachytherapy (total dose range, 12.5-28.0 Gy) and external-beam radiation therapy (EBT) (total dose range, 12-30 Gy). Nine patients underwent radiation therapy with 40.2-50.0-Gy PDR brachytherapy only. The prescribed radiation dose was 0.5-1.0 Gy per pulse. Patients were examined for local tumor control and treatment-related side effects. Result(s): Twelve of 17 patients had no local tumor at a median follow-up time of 59 months (range, 20-84 months); two of these patients showed signs of having distant disease. One patient died after a cerebral stroke without evidence of tumor. Four women treated with combined EBT and brachytherapy had secondary local tumor recurrences 4, 8, 8, and 11 months after therapy and had to undergo mastectomy. Despite having undergone radiation therapy previously, patients had side effects limited to moderate (grade 1-2) fibrosis. Conclusion(s): Local tumor excision combined with PDR brachytherapy for small local-regional tumor recurrences after primary BCT is feasible and well tolerated and might obviate mastectomy. Preliminary experiences are encouraging. Further studies are required for appropriate patient selection. © RSNA, 2002.",Excluded
2652,"Baseline characteristics and response to GH replacement of hypopituitary patients previously irradiated for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma: data from the Pfizer International Metabolic Database OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis whether the effects of GH replacement therapy in adults could be affected by prior pituitary irradiation, the baseline characteristics and response to GH were evaluated in adults with severe GH deficiency (GHD), who had received or not irradiation for the treatment of pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma.DESIGN: Data from 447 patients, who had received radiotherapy (427 in addition to surgery), and 630 patients, who were operated on but not irradiated for their tumour, were retrieved from Pfizer International Metabolic Database (KIMS) and compared at baseline and 1 and 2 years following the onset of GH replacement.RESULTS: Irradiated and non-irradiated patients exhibited the expected phenotype of GHD at baseline. However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response. These beneficial effects were maintained and the BMC also increased in both groups by the second year of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that prior irradiation for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma does not compromise the beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy.",Included
3362,"Endovascular treatment of superior vena cava syndrome: What you need to know before you start Background: Malignancy is the major etiologic factor of SVCS. Medical treatment, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are dependent on the histological type and provide clinical relief for a short duration with high recurrence rate. Revascularization by EVT comprising angioplasty and stent placement is the first-line treatment. Clinical Findings/Procedure: Pictorial review of 200 treated patients. Orthopnea and edema of the upper body are the main symptoms but respiratory distress, convulsions, or coma due to cerebral edema are also described. Main causes are tumor invasion (60%-97%) with bronchopulmonary cancers being the most common (60%-90%) followed by lymphomas (6%-25%) and metastases. The tumor may be treated with radiation or chemotherapy, with efficacy rates up to 94% and 77%, respectively, but this varies with histologic types. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and femoral venous access alone is used when possible. Brachial or jugular approaches can be used if dual venous access is required. From our experience, self-expandable stents outperform balloonexpandable stents and thrombolysis may be used before or after stent placement in cases of severe obstruction or stent thrombosis. Relief of symptoms after stenting is usually complete or partial and recurrences may be treated by reintervention. Conclusion(s): EVT for malignancy-related SVCS has a satisfactory level of clinical success with relatively low morbidity and mortality in the context of neoplasm. It also allows the possibility of reintervention in cases of recurrence.",Excluded

Tilting subjects with high disconjugacy scores slightly to one side and the other failed to find a position that decreased disconjugacy in hypergravity, leading to the conclusion that a simple planar asymmetry about the y-axis was probably not the cause of the observed torsional differences in the two eyes. Disconjugacy increased at 0 G with increasing parabolas, much more so in subjects who had suffered SMS. Because of this, 10 to 20 parabolas were deemed to be a more certain discriminator than a fewer number.",Excluded
2512,"LINAC radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors: retrospective - cohort study of 23 patients Background: Glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs) are uncommon and locally disruptive tumors that usually arise within the jugular foramen of the temporal bone. Surgery was the treatment of choice up until recently. In the last decades, however, radiosurgery has surfaced as a promising alternative treatment by providing excellent tumor control with low risk of cranial nerve injuries. Our aim was to examine the results of radiosurgery specifically, linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (LINAC SRS) for GJT treatment. We hypothesized that radiosurgery will reduce the size of the tumor and improve neurological symptoms. Design and method: Between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2013, 30 patients with GJTs were treated in Sheba Medical Center using LINAC SRS treatment. Comprehensive clinical follow-up was available for 23 patients. Sixteen patients were female and seven males with a median age of 64 years, with a range of 18-87 years. In 19 of the patients, LINAC SRS was the primary treatment, whereas in the remaining four cases, surgery or embolization preceded radiosurgery. The median treated dose to tumor margin was 14 Gy (range 12-27 Gy), and the median tumor volume before treatment was 5 ml (range 0.5-15 ml). Result(s): Following the LINAC SRS treatment, 14 of 23 patients (60%) showed improvement of previous neurological deficits, nine patients (40%) remained unchanged. At the end of a follow-up, tumor reduction was seen in 13 patients and a stable volume in eight (91% tumor control rate). Two cases of tumor progression were noted. Three patients (13%) had post- SRS complications during the follow-up, two of which achieved tumor control, while in one the tumor advanced. Conclusion(s): LINAC SRS is a practical treatment option for GJTs, with a high rate of tumor control and satisfactory neurological improvement.

2727,"Retrospective outcomes of right colon continent urinary diversion in a single center, improving the characterization of complication and reoperation risk INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Published studies of right colon pouch urinary diversion have variable outcomes with an estimated 1-50% risk of perioperative Clavien-Dindo 3+ complications and 1-69% risk of long term reoperation. This range is partly due to variability in outcome measurement and inclusion of differing patient characteristics and operative indications; it is unclear which factors are predisposing factors for complications and risk of reoperation in these studies leaving preoperative counseling difficult. We seek to characterize the impact that patient specific factors and operative indications have on risk of complications and reoperation for patients undergoing a right colon pouch as well as present the cumulative risk of reoperation over time. METHOD(S): Patients undergoing right colon pouch from January 2010 to April 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes of interest were rate of Clavien-Dindo complications in the perioperative period, readmission rate, and rate of reoperation. Patient specific factors association with Clavien Grade 3+ complications and reoperation were also analyzed. Operative indication for patients was stratified into: Cancer, Radiation Injury, Neurogenic, and Non-Neurogenic. A Kaplan Meier plot was used to characterize reoperation risk over time with death as a competing factor. RESULT(S): During the study period 60 patients underwent the procedure with an average follow up of 22 months. The rate of Clavien Grade 3+ complications and readmission rate in the 90 day post operative period was 25% and 43% respectively. The cumulative rate of reoperation was 52%. Overall no patient factors or operative indications were significantly associated with complications or reoperation. CONCLUSION(S): Overall the rate of complications, readmissions, and reoperation was high, but in agreement with other contemporary series. Right colon pouch is a difficult procedure on which to counsel patients due to the paucity of available data. The surgical outcomes and results at our center help further characterize the risks associated with this procedure, and the Kaplan Meier plot of reoperation risk can be used to illustrate that this procedure comes with significant risks over time.",Excluded
3546,"Cranial CT with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction: Improved image quality with concomitant radiation dose reduction BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To safeguard patient health, there is great interest in CT radiation-dose reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an iterative-reconstruction algorithm, ASIR, on image-quality measures in reduced-dose head CT scans for adult patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 64-section scanner, we analyzed 100 reduced-dose adult head CT scans at 6 predefined levels of ASIR blended with FBP reconstruction. These scans were compared with 50 CT scans previously obtained at a higher routine dose without ASIR reconstruction. SNR and CNR were computed from Hounsfield unit measurements of normal GM and WM of brain parenchyma. A blinded qualitative analysis was performed in 10 lower-dose CT datasets compared with higher-dose ones without ASIR. Phantom data analysis was also performed. RESULT(S): Lower-dose scans without ASIR had significantly lower mean GM and WM SNR (P = .003) and similar GM-WM CNR values compared with higher routine-dose scans. However, at ASIR levels of 20%-40%, there was no statistically significant difference in SNR, and at ASIR levels of >=60%, the SNR values of the reduced-dose scans were significantly higher (P < .01). CNR values were also significantly higher at ASIR levels of >=40% (P < .01). Blinded qualitative review demonstrated significant improvements in perceived image noise, artifacts, and GM-WM differentiation at ASIR levels >=60% (P < .01). CONCLUSION(S): These results demonstrate that the use of ASIR in adult head CT scans reduces image noise and increases low-contrast resolution, while allowing lower radiation doses without affecting spatial resolution.",Excluded

Nystagmus was recorded during and after 1 min of 120 degrees/s rotation. Gains and time constants were determined by computer analysis. Responses correlated with experience. Two subjects were making their first spaceflight. In parabolic flight, their time constants shortened to an average of 60% of 1 G values, presumably because unfamiliar otolith cues reduced VS. However, after 4-10 days in orbit, their time constants were similar or greater than those preflight, indicating VS recovery. The other two subjects had previously flown in space. Their time constants shortened in orbit to an average of 69% of 1 G values, indicating a persisting reduction of VS. This correlation with spaceflight experience has been seen in 9 of 11 subjects on 3 missions. Head pitch did not significantly ""dump"" nystagmus as it does on Earth.",Excluded
3224,"Ultrasound assessment of atheromatous changes in the vertebral and common carotid artery in patients after radiation due to breast cancer Introduction. Early diagnosis and modern radiotherapy have helped to significantly improve the prognosis in breast cancer, decrease mortality and increase the frequency of vascular complications connected with the treatment. The increase in the risk of vascular complications may be caused by inflammatory and atheromatous changes in the coronary and carotid arteries provoked by ionizing radiation. It has been proved that the risk of stroke in a long-term observation of patients who have completed the treatment (average observation time 4.5 years) is significantly higher than in non-treated patients. On the basis of the above information, one can suppose that the factor responsible for acute brain incident, such as stroke, in patients after radiotherapy due to breast cancer, as in patients irradiated because of head and neck cancers, is hemodynamically significant radiation-induced narrowing of the vessels. Objectives. Ultrasound assessment of vessel walls and Doppler measurement of blood flow parameters in the radiated arteries in the supraclavicular area (the first part of the common carotid artery, vertebral artery) as well as determination of a difference in the assessed parameters of the wall morphology and blood flow waveform between the side treated with radiotherapy and the non-treated side. The third aim was the assessment of the dynamics of atheromatous changes over time after finishing radiotherapy. Material and method. A group of 41 patients treated at the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland were observed from the year 2003 to 2014. The average age of the patients was 60. The dose in the supraclavicular area was identical for all patients and amounted to 50.0 Gy. The average time after the treatment ended was 54 months. The assessment of vessels concerned both common carotid arteries (CCA), the division of the common carotid arteries, the initial internal carotid arteries (ICA) including the measurement of the internal and medial membrane (Intima-Media Thickness - IMT) in the proximal segment of the CCA and the vertebral arteries with particular regard to their proximal segment. Results. The average IMT on the radiated side was 0.68 +/- 0.11 mm, and on the opposite side - 0.62 +/- 0.09 mm. On the basis of the statistical analysis of the differences between average IMT on the radiated side (IMT-RT) and IMT of the non-radiated side (IMT NRT), it has been confirmed that it is statistically significant (p = (0,044) for the assumed relevance level of p = 0.05. When analyzing the change of IMT over the time that passed from the conclusion of treatment, it was found that it had no important influence on the increase in the internal membrane thickness. In the second stage of the research, it was attempted to assess the proximal segment of the vertebral artery and indirectly the subclavian artery using B-duplex ultrasonography. The results show that narrowing is more common on the radiated side. In one case, narrowing of the vertebral artery and its thickening throughout all the observed segment from V0 to V2 were observed, which suggests inflammatory lesions caused by radiation in all three arterial walls. Conclusions. Radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer involving the supraclavicular arteries causes an increase in internal membrane thickness in the common carotid arteries. Radiation of this area increases the frequency of vertebral artery narrowing in the proximal segment. Copyright © ONKOLOGIA I RADIOTERAPIA 2015.",Excluded

3153,"Does iterative reconstruction lower CT radiation dose: evaluation of 15,000 examinations PURPOSE: Evaluation of 15,000 computed tomography (CT) examinations to investigate if iterative reconstruction (IR) reduces sustainably radiation exposure.METHOD AND MATERIALS: Information from 15,000 CT examinations was collected, including all aspects of the exams such as scan parameter, patient information, and reconstruction instructions. The examinations were acquired between January 2010 and December 2012, while after 15 months a first generation IR algorithm was installed. To collect the necessary information from PACS, RIS, MPPS and structured reports a Dose Monitoring System was developed. To harvest all possible information an optical character recognition system was integrated, for example to collect information from the screenshot CT-dose report. The tool transfers all data to a database for further processing such as the calculation of effective dose and organ doses. To evaluate if IR provides a sustainable dose reduction, the effective dose values were statistically analyzed with respect to protocol type, diagnostic indication, and patient population.RESULTS: IR has the potential to reduce radiation dose significantly. Before clinical introduction of IR the average effective dose was 10.1+/-7.8mSv and with IR 8.9+/-7.1mSv (p*=0.01). Especially in CTA, with the possibility to use kV reduction protocols, such as in aortic CTAs (before IR: average14.2+/-7.8mSv; median11.4mSv /with IR:average9.9+/-7.4mSv; median7.4mSv), or pulmonary CTAs (before IR: average9.7+/-6.2mSV; median7.7mSv /with IR: average6.4+/-4.7mSv; median4.8mSv) the dose reduction effect is significant(p*=0.01). On the contrary for unenhanced low-dose scans of the cranial (for example sinuses) the reduction is not significant (before IR:average6.6+/-5.8mSv; median3.9mSv/with IR:average6.0+/-3.1mSV; median3.2mSv).CONCLUSION: The dose aspect remains a priority in CT research. Iterative reconstruction algorithms reduce sustainably and significantly radiation dose in the clinical routine. Our results illustrate that not only in studies with a limited number of patients but also in the clinical routine, IRs provide long-term dose saving.",Excluded

3068,"Necessity of repeat head computed tomography (CT) scans in mild traumatic brain injury patients INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical TBI severity grading system. CT scanning has also become a sensitive diagnostic tool in assessing TBIs. Currently, there is a widely varied practice in evaluation of patients with mild TBIs. We hypothesize that patients with an initially positive head CT and stable GCS (15) are less likely to have positive repeat CTs than patients who's GCS has dropped below 15. METHOD(S): A 5 year retrospective analysis was done (Jan 2007- Dec 2011). Data points included ISS, ICU LOS, Hospital LOS, initial GCS, first head CT scan, lowest GCS between scans, and treatment after 2nd CT. Positive CT findings were considered an increase in contusion, bleed, edema, midline shift, or a new bleed. RESULT(S): In 369 patients, those with a stable GCS (15) were less likely to have a positive repeat CT scan than patients who whose GCS dropped (12.9% vs 24.9%, p<.01). They also tended to require less Interventions (0.8% vs 4.0%, p=0.09). Unchanged patients were more likely to have a lower ISS (14 vs 17, p<.01), ICU LOS(2 vs 3 days, p<.01), and Hospital LOS( 4 vs 6, p<.01). CONCLUSION(S): CT scans are a rapid, non-invasive diagnostic tool that can accurately diagnose a patient's intracranial status. Our study shows that most patients who have initially positive CT scans and maintain a stable GCS of 15 can still safely forego the cost and radiation exposure of repeated scans.",Excluded
3024,"Low amounts of the DNA repair XPA protein are sufficient to recover UV-resistance DNA integrity is threatened by the damaging effects of physical and chemical agents that can affect its function. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the most known and flexible mechanisms of DNA repair. This mechanism can recognize and remove damages causing DNA double-helix distortion, including the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts, promoted by ultraviolet light (UV). The human syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is clinically characterized chiefly by the early onset of severe photosensitivity of the exposed regions of the skin, a very high incidence of skin cancers and frequent neurological abnormalities. The xpa gene seems to be involved during UV damage recognition, in both global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR). The modulation of xpa expression may modify the DNA repair rate in the cell genome, providing a valuable contribution to an understanding of the NER process. The controlled expression of the cDNA xpa in XP12RO deficient cells was achieved through the transfection of a muristerone-A inducible vector, pINXA. The INXA15 clone shows good induction of the XPA protein and total complementation of XP12RO cell deficiency. Overexpression of this protein resulted in UV cell survival comparable to normal control human cells. Moreover, low expression of the XPA protein in these cells is sufficient for total complementation in cellular UV sensitivity and DNA repair activity. These data demonstrate that XPA protein concentration is not a limiting factor for DNA repair.",Excluded
3520,"Accurate event-driven motion compensation in high-resolution PET incorporating scattered and random events With continuing improvements in spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, small patient movements during PET imaging become a significant source of resolution degradation.

In particular, this paper proposes an effective method to incorporate presence of scattered and random coincidences in the context of motion (which is similarly applicable to various other motion correction schemes). The overall reconstruction framework takes into consideration missing projection data which are not detected due to motion, and additionally, incorporates information from all detected events, including those which fall outside the field-of-view following motion correction. The proposed approach has been extensively validated using phantom experiments as well as realistic simulations of a new mathematical brain phantom developed in this work, and the results for a dynamic patient study are also presented.",Excluded

We measured both, visual acuity and glare due to forward light scatter using a computer system.RESULTS: Following treatment both groups had equally significant (< 0.001) improvements in visual acuity. However, a significant (p < 0.001) improvement of glare due to forward light scatter was only observed in the eyes with a large size capsulotomy.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that measurements of forward light scatter are more sensitive than visual acuity testing in demonstrating loss of visual performance in patients with media opacities. It is recommended that pupils are dilated prior to Nd:YAG capsulotomy if forward light scatter from capsule remnants and the subsequent glare disability are to be minimised.",Excluded

Changes increased with time after the incidence of SCI. TMS revealed reduced excitability and prolonged silent periods for muscles more distant to the deafferented area.CONCLUSIONS: Whereas fMRI demonstrated changes in representation sites adjacent to the deafferented area, TMS excitability changes were also observed more distant to the deafferented area and silent periods were prolonged in comparison to healthy controls. TMS changes might depend on both: the distance to the deafferented area and the time of persistence of deafferentation.",Excluded
2571,"Performance and brain electrical activity during prolonged confinement A subset of the AGARD-STRES battery including memory search, unstable tracking, and a combination of both tasks (dual-task), was applied repeatedly to the four chamber crew members before, during, and after the 60-day isolation period of EXEMSI. Five ground control group members served as a control group. A subjective state questionnaire was also included. The results were subjected to a quantitative single-subject analysis. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded to permit correlation of changes in task performance with changes in the physiological state. Evaluation of the EEG focused on spectral parameters of spontaneous EEG waves. No physiological data were collected from the control group. Significant decrements in tracking ability were observed in the chamber crew. The time course of these effects followed a triphasic pattern with initial deterioration, intermediate recovery to pre-isolation baseline scores after the first half of the isolation period, and a second deterioration towards the end. None of the control group subjects displayed such an effect. Memory search (speed and accuracy) was only occasionally impaired during isolation, but the control group displayed a similar pattern of changes. It is suggested that a state of decreased alertness causes tracking deterioration, which leads to a reduced efficiency of sustained cue utilization. The assumption of low alertness was further substantiated by higher fatigue ratings by the chamber crew compared to those of the control group. Analysis of the continuous EEG recordings revealed that only two subjects produced reliable alpha wave activity (8-12 Hz) over Pz and, to a much smaller extent, Fz-theta wave activity (5-7 Hz) during task performance. In both subjects Pz-alpha power decreased consistently under task conditions involving single-task and dual-task tracking. Fz-theta activity was increased more by single-task and dual-task memory search than by single-task tracking. The alpha attenuation appears to be associated with an increasing demand on perceptual cue utilization required by the tracking performance. In one subject marked attenuation of alpha power occurred during the first half of the confinement period, where he also scored the highest fatigue ratings. A striking increase in fronto-central theta activity was observed in the same subject after six weeks of isolation. The change was associated with an efficient rather than a degraded task performance, and a high rating of the item ""concentrated"" and a low rating of the item ""fatigued."" This finding supports the hypothesis that the activation state associated with increased fronto-central theta activity accompanies efficient performance of demanding mental tasks. The usefulness of standardized laboratory tasks as monitoring instruments is demonstrated by the direct comparability with results of studies obtained from other relevant research applications using the same tasks. The feasibility of a self-administered integrated psychophysiological assessment of the individual state was illustrated by the nearly complete collection of data. The large number of individual data collected over the entire period permitted application of quantitative single-subject analysis, allowing reliable determination of changes in the individual state in the course of time. It thus appears that this assessment technique can be adapted for in-flight monitoring of astronauts during prolonged spaceflights. Parallel EEG recording can provide relevant supplementary information for diagnosing the individual activation state associated with task performance. The existence of large individual differences in the generation of task-sensitive EEG rhythms forms an important issue for further studies.",Excluded

Bartal Radiology, Meir MC, Kfar-Saba, Israel Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the potential risks of occupational radiation exposure 2. To learn about the dose limits for different organs and acceptable dose 3. To learn how to estimate the risks As more evidence is emerging from recent publications on the dangers of occupational radiation exposure in Image (Fluoroscopy) guided interventions there is a clear need to recognize the risks, to learn about staff dose limits and the ways to reduce the possible damage to a Minimum. Recent publications confirm the alarming incidence and variety of occupational-related illnesses of medical staff working in the interventional laboratory (1, 2, 3). International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) issued a new recommendation for the occupational dose limit to the lens of the eye based on the new threshold for lens effects and the suggested equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye was reduced from 150mSv year-1 (ICRP 2013 Proceedings) to 20mSv year-1, averaged over a 5-year period, with no year's dose exceeding 50mSv (ICRP, 2012). Last International and European BSS (Basic Safety Standards) comprises new limit (European Commission, 2012; IAEA, 2014) for the medical staff (1). Relatively high exposure doses have been reported for both extremities (2) and the eye lens (3, 4) of the Interventional Radiologists (IRs) that in some cases, exceed the personal dose limits. Moreover, new controlled data suggest lower or even no dose threshold for radiation- induced eye lens injuries. These data are under consideration by the ICRP and may lead to the re-evaluation of the existing dose limit (1). There is no ""acceptable dose"" definition or recommendation for the personnel, as it depends on the specific applications and is different for public, workers and patients. There are dose limits for the personnel, which are not applicable to the medical exposure of patients. Noticeably, new dose thresholds, particularly the 0.5 Gy threshold for the lens of the eye, affect occupational protection for operators and other staff, which is principally important for fluoroscopically guided procedures (1, 6). Regrettably, not all operators protect their eyes or their brain sufficiently during interventions. After several years of work without proper protection, cumulative absorbed doses to the lens can exceed 0.5 Gy [ RELID (Retrospective Evaluation of Lens Injuries and Dose) (see: https://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/ news/relid-cataract-study.htm)]. During most of the IAEA surveys of radiation-related lens opacities in interventionalists and staff, 40-50% of the professionals involved in interventional cardiology procedures who volunteered to be examined had posterior subcapsular lens opacities (2, 3, 4). Only 10% of the members of the control groups had such opacities. Important to note that most of the observed lens opacities were in interventionists who had worked for several years without any eye protection. The dose rate to the operator can exceed 10 mSv h-1 when the 'high-dose' fluoroscopy mode is used and 50 mSv h-1 during cine acquisition. The highest dose rate was recorded at the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO 90) projection, which corresponds to the lateral projection when the operator is standing at the tube side (4, 5). Many medical specialties outside the imaging departments (e.g. vascular surgery, urology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, anaesthetics and pain management) are starting to use or increase their use of fluoroscopically guided procedures in surgical theatres without the radiation protection tools available in standard interventional laboratories (ICRP, 2010). Such a practice may result in occupational doses or these physicians that are higher than the typical values recorded in interventional radiology and cardiology services, where protection tools are used regularly (6). Lack of compliance with the regular use of personal dosimetry has been a problem for many years in many countries (5, 7). This is one of the reasons for the shortage of an accurate occupational dose data (and reliable radiation risk estimations) in different professional groups. One of the methods of estimating staff doses is working on Monte Carlo calculations and detection of staff location in the catheterisation laboratory to calculate approximately staff doses during clinical procedures through the use of radiographic and geometric data. Another method that was recently published is use of a realistic approach to estimate lens doses in interventional cardiology when personal dosimeters are not used regularly. The authors concluded that for around 2000 diagnostic, PCI, and valvular procedures, when the median scatter dose value per procedure at the C-arm was 0.78, 1.07, and 1.45 mSv, respectively (4). Lens doses are approximately 50-60% of these values when radiation protection tools are not used. For all of these procedures, the ratio between the scatter dose at the C-arm and the kerma-area product was 10.3-11.3 mSv(Gy cm2)-1 (6). Several medical societies including CIRSE and SIR have published or endorsed documents on occupational protection that are also expected to improve staff radiation safety (7). New ethical issues are emerging in situations where reducing patient dose involves increasing staff doses and vice versa. Occupational radiological protection is still a challenge in several clinical situations. ICRP has included specific recommendations and advice for occupational protection in most of its publications in recent years (ICRP, 2000, 2007 a,b,c, 2009, 2010, 2013 a,b). Operator dose (incident air kerma) at the typical working position is around 1/1000 of incident air kerma at the patient's skin, so the instantaneous dose rate to an unprotected operator may reach approximately 5mGymin-1. Newer active personal dosimeters display occupational dose rates in real time inside the interventional fluoroscopy suite, and allow subsequent detailed analyses of staff and patient doses by recording dose at very short intervals. This data on implementation of the real time active personnel dosimetry permit the development of new optimisation strategies to improve occupational protection (7, 9).",Excluded

They were irradiated 14 days after implantation by arrays of 25 microm wide microbeams in unidirectional mode, with a skin entrance dose of 625 Gy. The effect of using 200 or 100 microm center-to-center spacing between the microbeams was compared. The median survival time (post-implantation) was 40 and 67 days at 200 and 100 microm spacing, respectively. However, 72% of rats irradiated at 100 microm spacing showed abnormal clinical signs and weight patterns, whereas only 12% of rats were affected at 200 microm spacing. In parallel, histological lesions of the normal brain were found in the 100 microm series only. Although the increase in lifespan was equal to 273% and 102% for the 100 and 200 microm series, respectively, the 200 microm spacing protocol provides a better sparing of healthy tissue and may prove useful in combination with other radiation modalities or additional drugs.",Included
3256,"Response of intracerebral human glioblastoma xenografts to multifraction radiation exposures PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of fractionated radiation treatments on the life spans of athymic rats bearing intracerebral brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: U-251 MG or U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells were implanted into the brains of athymic rats, and the resulting tumors were irradiated once daily with various doses of ionizing radiation for 5 consecutive days or for 10 days with a 2-day break after Day 5.RESULTS: Five daily doses of 1 and 1.5 Gy, and 10 doses of 0.75 and 1 Gy, cured some U-251 MG tumors. However, five daily doses of 0.5 Gy increased the survival time of animals bearing U-251 MG tumors 5 days without curing any animals of their tumors. Ten doses of 0.3 Gy given over 2 weeks extended the lifespan of the host animals 9 days without curing any animals. For U-87 MG tumors, 5 daily doses of 3 Gy produced an increased lifespan of 8 days without curing any animals, and 10 doses of 1 Gy prolonged lifespan 5.5 days without curing any animals. The differences in extension of life span between the 5- and 10-fraction protocols were minor for either tumor type.CONCLUSION: The finding that the U-251 MG tumors are more sensitive than U-87 MG tumors, despite the fact that U-251 MG tumors contain many more hypoxic cells than U-87 MG tumors, suggests the intrinsic cellular radiosensitivities of these cell lines are more important than hypoxia in determining their in vivo radiosensitivities.",Excluded
3096,"[The place of radiosurgery in the treatment of hypophyseal adenoma] Since 1984, the neurosurgical team of Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris has taken in charge almost 750 patients for linear accelerator radiosurgery. But only a small percentage of them were harbouring a pituitary tumor. That is why the present paper is based mostly on literature data. Pituitary adenoma radiosurgery (RS) is a second intention therapeutic method. It should be recommended only after failure of medical and/or surgical treatment. Two main methods can be used: linear accelerator-radiosurgery and Cobalt-60 gamma unit. Both procedures provide equivalent results in terms of dosimetry, accuracy and clinical data. Results of various series presented in recent and updated literature have been studied and analysed. They show and confirm the efficiency of radiosurgery on tumor and hormone secretion controls, with few cases of pituitary insufficiency. However, results were disappointing concerning visual disorders, particularly if visual dysfunction and impairment existed before radiosurgery. All authors agree nowadays on different points: a) indications: invasive adenomas, with an incomplete resection, or adenomatous recurrences, b) contraindications: tumoral size > 20 mm, distance to visual pathways < 5 mm, c) imperative precautionary measures: less than 8 Gray must be delivered on visual pathways, less than 40 Gray on oculomotor nerves. In some cases, stereotactic fractioned radiotherapy may be an alternative treatment for large tumors close to visual pathways. [References: 21]",Excluded
3110,"Cholinergic modulation of visuospatial responding in central thalamus Central thalamus has extensive connections with basal ganglia and frontal cortex that are thought to play a critical role in sensory-guided goal-directed behavior. Central thalamic activity is influenced by cholinergic projections from mesopontine nuclei. To elucidate this function we trained rats to respond to lights in a reaction time (RT) task and compared effects of muscarinic (2.4, 7.3, 22 nmol scopolamine) and nicotinic (5.4, 16, 49, 98 nmol mecamylamine) antagonists with the GABA(A) agonist muscimol (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 nmol) in central thalamus. We compared this with subcutaneous (systemic) effects of mecamylamine (3.2, 9.7, 29 micromol/kg) and scopolamine (0.03, 0.09, 0.26 micromol/kg). Subcutaneous scopolamine increased omissions (failure to respond within a 3-s response window) at the highest dose tested. Subcutaneous mecamylamine increased omissions at the highest dose tested while impairing RT and per cent correct at lower doses. Intrathalamic injections of muscimol and mecamylamine decreased per cent correct at doses that did not affect omissions or RT. Intrathalamic scopolamine increased omissions and RT at doses that had little effect on per cent correct. Anatomical controls indicated that the effects of mecamylamine were localized in central thalamus and those of scopolamine were not. Drug effects did not interact with attention-demanding manipulations of stimulus duration, proximity of stimulus and response locations, or stimulus array size. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that central thalamus mediates decisional processes linking sensory stimuli with actions, downstream from systems that detect sensory signals. They also provide evidence that this function is specifically influenced by nicotinic cholinergic receptors.",Excluded
3106,"Microwave irradiation of rats at 2.45 GHz activates pinocytotic-like uptake of tracer by capillary endothelial cells of cerebral cortex Far-field exposures of male albino rats to 2.45-GHz microwaves (10-microseconds pulses, 100 pps) at a low average power density (10 mW/cm2; SAR approximately 2 W/kg) and short durations (30-120 min) resulted in increased uptakes of tracer through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The uptake of systemically administered rhodamine-ferritin complex by capillary endothelial cells (CECs) of the cerebral cortex was dependent on power density and on duration of exposure. At 5 mW/cm2, for example, a 15-min exposure had no effect. Near-complete blockade of uptake resulted when rats were treated before exposure to microwaves with a single dose of colchicine, which inhibits microtubular function. A pinocytotic-like mechanism is presumed responsible for the microwave-induced increase in BBB permeability.",Excluded

2688,"Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost: The feasibility and cosmetic outcome of a fractionated outpatient delivery scheme Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, potential toxicity, and cosmetic outcome of fractionated interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost for the management of patients with breast cancer at increased risk for local recurrence.Methods and Materials: From 1994 to 1996, 18 women with early stage breast cancer underwent conventionally fractionated whole breast radiotherapy (50-50.4 Gy) followed by interstitial HDR brachytherapy boost. All were considered to be at high risk for local failure. Seventeen had pathologically confirmed final surgical margins of less than 2 mm or focally positive. Brachytherapy catheter placement and treatment delivery were conducted on an outpatient basis. Preplanning was used to determine optimal catheter positions to enhance dose homogeneity of dose delivery. The total HDR boost dose was 15 Gy delivered in 6 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 days. Local control, survival, late toxicities (LENT-SOMA), and cosmetic outcome were recorded in follow-up. In addition, factors potentially influencing cosmesis were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The minimum follow-up is 40 months with a median 50 months. Sixteen patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. There have been no in-breast failures observed. One patient died with brain metastases, and another died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease. Grade 1-2 late toxicities included 39% with hyperpigmentation, 56% with detectable fibrosis, 28% with occasional discomfort, and 11% with visible telangiectasias. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in one patient as persistent discomfort. Sixty-seven percent of patients were considered to have experienced good/excellent cosmetic outcomes. Factors with a direct relationship to adverse cosmetic outcome were extent of surgical defect (p = 0.00001), primary excision volume (p = 0.017), and total excision volume (p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): For high risk patients who may benefit from increased doses, interstitial HDR brachytherapy provides a convenient outpatient method for boosting the lumpectomy cavity following conventional whole breast irradiation without overdosing normal tissues. The fractionation scheme of 15 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is well tolerated. The volume of tissue removed from the breast at lumpectomy appears to dominate cosmetic outcome in this group of patients. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
3428,"Integration of the heart rhythmogenesis levels: heart rhythm generator in the brain We propose that along with the intracardiac pacemaker, a generator of cardiac rhythm exists in the central nervous system--in the efferent structures of the cardiovascular center of the medullar oblongata. Signals in the medulla oblongata arise as a result of the hierarchic interaction of the brain structures. Neural signals originating there in the form of bursts of impulses conduct to the heart along the vagus nerves and after interaction with cardiac pacemaker structures, cause generation of the cardiac pulse in exact accordance with the frequency of ""neural bursts"". The intrinsic cardiac rhythm generator (the sinus node) is a life-sustaining factor that maintains the heart pumping function when the central nervous system is in a stage of deep inhibition, (e.g., under anesthesia or during unconsciousness). The brain generator is the factor that provides heart adaptive reactions in behaving organism. The integration of the two levels of rhythmogenesis in the brain and heart provides reliability and functional perfection of the cardiac rhythm generation system in the whole organism.",Excluded
2441,"Radiosurgical treatment for epilepsy associated with cavernomas Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain, which often present with drug-resistant epilepsy. Microsurgical excision remains the preferred approach for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of Gamma Knife (GK) surgery in the management of drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs in a retrospective multicenter study. Forty-nine patients with cortical or subcortical CMs with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these GK procedures was 7.5 (+/-9.3) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 6.9/month (+/-14). The mean marginal radiation dose was 19.17 Gy. At the last follow-up examination, 53% were seizure free. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for another 20%. The remaining 26% of patients showed little or no improvement. The morbidity was low. Radiosurgery is a promising management modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome. Further prospective work is necessary to validate our data.",Excluded

Additionally, we show that neuronal gene size expansion occurred predominantly through net gains in intron size, with a positional bias toward the 5' end of each gene.CONCLUSIONS: We find that intron and gene size expansion is a feature of many genes whose expression is enriched in nervous systems. We speculate that unique attributes of neurons may subject neuronal genes to evolutionary forces favoring net size expansion. This process could be associated with tissue-specific constraints on gene function and/or the evolution of increasingly complex gene regulation in nervous systems.",Excluded
2693,"Controlled E-field gradient coils Peripheral neural stimulation is a major problem in current gradient coil designs. Induced current problems in patients relate directly to gradient strength and modulation frequency. Current designs of gradient coil tend to limit ultra-high-speed imaging methods such as echo-planar imaging through the effect of induced currents which produce tingling sensations and involuntary muscle twitch. Neural stimulation could also trigger epileptic fits and/or cardiac fibrillation. For reduction of induced currents, an important aspect is the coil geometry. It is desirable to design the gradient coil in such a way as to prevent closed loop circulating currents within the body. Preliminary results using a four-sector gradient coil with rectangular geometry, operating in a low mutual coupling mode, indicate significant reduction in the E-field within the subject volume of the coil. Reduction in induced currents in the patient allows safer operation at higher magnetic field strengths together with faster scans currently prohibited through neural stimulation effects in standard coil geometries.",Excluded
3302,"Whole brain radiotherapy using four-field box technique with tilting baseplate for parotid gland sparing Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of four-field box whole brain radiotherapy (FB-WBRT) with tilting baseplate by comparing bilateral WBRT (B-WBRT). Methods and Materials: Between March 2016 and September 2018, 20 patients with brain metastases underwent WBRT using the four-field box technique. WBRT is performed with a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions daily. Two computed tomography simulations per person were performed. One was in the traditional supine position for B-WBRT and the other by applying the tilting acrylic supine baseplate to elevate the head by 40degree for FB-WBRT. The B-WBRT used the field-in-field technique, which is the most commonly used method in our institution. The FB-WBRT comprised anterior, posterior, and bilateral beams. A wedge was applied in anterior and posterior fields to compensate for skull convexity. Result(s): The average of Dmean of both parotid glands was 10.2 Gy (range, 3.8 to 17.8 Gy) in B-WBRT and 5.4 Gy (range, 2.0 to 11.7 Gy) in FB-WBRT (p < 0.05). Compared to B-WBRT, FB-WBRT reduced the mean dose of the right and left parotid glands from 10.1 Gy to 4.9 Gy and from 10.4 Gy to 5.8 Gy, respectively (p < 0.05). Further, V<inf>5</inf>, V<inf>10</inf>, V<inf>15</inf>, V<inf>20</inf>, and V<inf>25</inf> for the parotid gland decreased significantly in FB-WBRT (p < 0.05). The Dmax and Dmean of lens decreased according to the dose-volume histogram.

AIM: To assess the effectiveness and economy of routinely using commercially available in-plane bismuth shielding during CT scanning of the chest and brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty patients were scanned with thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs) in situ to measure the radiation dose to the thyroid and eye during CT scanning of the brain and chest. Half of the patients had the ""AttenuRad"" shield in place during scanning.RESULTS: Use of the shielding reduced the mean dose to the eye from 6.0 +/- 0.3 mGy to 4.9 mGy +/- 0.2 mGy and the thyroid dose from 16.4 mGy +/- 1.2 mGy to 7.1 mGy +/- 0.5 mGy.CONCLUSION: Use of the thyroid shield is recommended for all CT scanning of the chest. The eye shield does not produce as marked a reduction in radiation dose to the lens of the eye, when an angled gantry is used, since the eyes are not in the primary beam. Use of the eyeshield is justifiable where irradiation of the orbit is unavoidable, although whether artifacts would be a problem if the shield was used in this way was not assessed.",Excluded
2621,"Color constancy of color-deficient observers under illuminations defined by individual color discrimination ellipsoids We explored the color constancy mechanisms of color-deficient observers under red, green, blue, and yellow illuminations. The red and green illuminations were defined individually by the longer axis of the color discrimination ellipsoid measured by the Cambridge Colour Test. Four dichromats (3 protanopes and 1 deuteranope), two anomalous trichromats (2 deuteranomalous observers), and five color-normal observers were asked to complete the color constancy task by making a simultaneous paper match under asymmetrical illuminations in haploscopic view on a monitor. The von Kries adaptation model was applied to estimate the cone responses. The model fits showed that for all color-deficient observers under all illuminations, the adjustment of the S-cone response or blue-yellow chromatically opponent responses modeled with the simple assumption of cone deletion in a certain type (S-M, S-L or S-(L+M)) was consistent with the principle of the von Kries model. The degree of adaptation was similar to that of color-normal observers. The results indicate that the color constancy of color-deficient observers is mediated by the simplified blue-yellow color system with a von Kries-type adaptation effect, even in the case of brightness match, as well as by a possible cone-level adaptation to the S-cone when the illumination produces a strong S-cone stimulation, such as blue illumination.",Excluded

Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included

Materials/Methods: Nine radiation oncologists (3 attendings, 6 residents) contoured the lung tumor internal target volumes (ITVs) in 6 patients using maximum intensity projection (MIP) images after 4D-CT simulation. Contouring was performed independently at 3 separate time points: prior to training based on department standards, after completing contouring training, and >2 weeks after the second session. Contouring variability was evaluated for variations in the magnitude of volumes (coefficient of variation (COV) = standard deviation/mean volume), the volume overlap (conformality index (CI) = common volume/encompassing volume), and differences in the centroid location. Contours were also compared clinically to determine radiographic features resulting in larger disagreement. Result(s): The mean volumes in cm3 for session 1, 2 and 3 were 6.52, 6.98 and 7.20 respectively. The mean COV for sessions 1 (0.25 +/- 0.05), 2 (0.24 +/- 0.04) and 3 (0.19 +/- 0.03) demonstrated significant improvement from session 1 to 3 (p = 0.03) while the CI also improved with each session, 0.35 +/-0.07, 0.36 +/-0.03 and 0.44 +/-0.04, respectively (p = 0.03 from session 1 to 3).

Conclusion(s): While there is large variation in contoured volumes, the centroid locations show excellent agreement. Intra- is smaller than interobserver variability; both can be improved with repeat contouring and standardized training, particularly in less experienced observers.

Recombinant Ad/reporter genes driven by five different promoters; CMV, VEGF, FLT-1, DR5 and survivin were constructed. Glioma cell lines were infected with different multiplicity of infection of the (promoter) Ad or CMV Ad. Cells were then exposed to a range of radiation (0-12 Gy) at single fraction. Fluorescent microscopy, Luc assay and X-gal staining was used to detect the level of expression of related genes. Different glioma cell lines and normal astrocytes were infected with Ad survivin and exposed to radiation. The promoters were analyzed for presence of CArG radio-responsive motifs and CCAAT box consensus using NCBI blast bioinformatics software.RESULTS: Radiotherapy increases the expression of gene expression by 1.25-2.5 fold in different promoters other than survivin after 2 h of radiation. RNA analysis was done and has shown an increase in copy number of tenfold for survivin. Most importantly cells treated with RT and Ad Luc driven by survivin promoter showed a fivefold increase in expression after 2 Gy of radiation in comparison to non-irradiated cells. Presence or absence of CArG motifs did not correlate with promoter response to radiation. Survivin with the best response to radiation had the lowest number of CCAAT box.CONCLUSION: Survivin is a selective potent radiation inducible promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy and this response to radiation could be independent of CArG motifs.",Excluded

Originally thought to be a variant of ataxia telangiectasia (AT), the cellular phenotype of NBS has been described as almost indistinguishable from that of AT. Since the gene involved in NBS has been cloned and its functions studied, we sought to further characterize its cellular phenotype by examining the response of density-inhibited, confluent cultures of human diploid fibroblasts to irradiation in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Both NBS and AT cells were markedly sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of radiation. NBS cells, however, were proficient in recovery from potentially lethal damage and exhibited a pronounced radiation-induced G(1)-phase arrest. Irradiated AT cells showed no potentially lethal damage and no G(1)-phase arrest. Both cell types were hypersensitive to the induction of chromosomal aberrations, whereas the distribution of aberrations in irradiated NBS cells was similar to that of normal controls, AT cells showed a high frequency of chromatid-type aberrations. TP53 and CDKN1A (also known as p21(Waf1)) expression was attenuated in irradiated NBS cells, but maximal induction occurred 2 h postirradiation, as was observed in normal controls.

METHOD(S): In 27 patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors a single intravenous injection of talaporfin sodium (40 mg/m2) was administered one day before surgical resection of the neoplasm. Next day after completion of the tumor removal the residual lesion and/or resection cavity were irradiated with 664-nmsemiconductor laser with a radiation power density of 150 mW/cm2 and radiation energy density of 27 J/cm2. The procedure was performed at 22-27 hours after drug administration. The study cohort included 22 patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumor. Thirteen of these neoplasms (59%) were newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RESULT(S): Among all 22 patients included into study cohort the 12-month overall survival (OS), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), and 6-months local PFS rates after surgery and PDT were 95.5%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed GBM all these parameters were 100%. Side effects on the skin, which could be attributable to administration of talaporfin sodium, were noted in 7% of patients and included rush (2 cases), blister (1 case), and erythema (1 case). Skin photosensitivity test results were relatively mild and fully disappeared within 15 days after administration of photosensitizer in all patients. CONCLUSION(S): Intraoperative PDT using talaporfin sodium and semiconductor laser may be considered as potentially effective and sufficiently safe option for adjuvant management of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors.

The vestibular schwannomas of 5 patients were associated with type II neurofibromatosis. The median follow-up time was 80 months (range: 6-167); the median planning target volume was 2.6 cm(3) (0.3-15.4); and the median prescribed dose (>=D90) was 21 Gy in three fractions (18-25 Gy in three to five fractions). Progression was defined as >=2 mm 3-dimensional post-treatment tumor enlargement excluding transient expansion. Progression or any death was counted as an event in progression-free survival rates, whereas only progression was counted in progression-free rates.RESULTS: The 7-year progression-free survival and progression-free rates were 78 and 95%, respectively. Late adverse events (>=3 months) with grades based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03 were observed in 6 patients: Grade 3 hydrocephalus in one patient, Grade 2 facial nerve disorders in two and Grade 1-2 tinnitus in three. In total, 12 out of 25 patients maintained pure tone averages <=50 dB before hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, and 6 of these 12 patients (50%) maintained pure tone averages at this level at the final audiometric follow-up after hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy. However, gradient deterioration of pure tone average was observed in 11 of these 12 patients. The mean pure tone averages before hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy and at the final follow-up for the aforementioned 12 patients were 29.8 and 57.1 dB, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Treating vestibular schwannomas with hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy in three to five fractions may prevent tumor progression with tolerable toxicity. However, gradient deterioration of pure tone average was observed.",Excluded
3697,"Soft tissue sarcomas of the popliteal fossa: Outcome and risk factors Background: Limb salvage surgery of popliteal soft tissue sarcomas may be hampered due to the incomplete anatomical containment of this region and the vicinity of neurovascular structures. The scope of this study was to determine outcome and to define risk factors. Patients and Methods: 27 patients (53.3 +/- 15.8 y; 16/27 male) with popliteal soft tissue sarcomas were assessed. Mean follow-up was 40.9 +/- 33.8 months (48.5 +/- 36.7 months in surviving patients). 9/27 patients were included after prior treatment elsewhere (5 after intralesional resections and 4 local recurrences). The lesions were staged IB in 8/27 patients, IIB in 17/27 and III in 2/27. Immediate amputations were performed in 7/27 patients. 15/27 patients were subjected to radiation therapy (preoperative in 6/15 cases), 8/27 patients received chemotherapy (5/8 preoperatively). Result(s): Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 y was 63.0% and 59.5%. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. 8/27 patients developed metastatic disease after 28.9 +/- 9.8 months. Survival (p = 0.397) and disease-free survival (p = 0.113) did not differ in patients after amputations vs limb salvage. Application of radiation therapy was associated with a better survival (p = 0.003). Complications related to the surgical intervention were recorded in 2/27 patients, complications related to radiation therapy occurred in 6/15 patients. Discussion(s): Despite being extra-compartmental, popliteal sarcomas can be treated with a high rate of limb salvage while equal safety compared to amputations is maintained. Irradiation improved survival in our patient population. In cases with involvement of neurovascular structures, preoperative down-staging with radio or chemo-therapy may prevent amputation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
3115,"Optimal timing and clinical value of radiotherapy in advanced ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with or without baseline brain metastases: implications from pattern of failure analyses BACKGROUND: Despite development of several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib remains one of the first-line treatment options for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and is widely used in situations where next-generation TKIs aren't yet approved or economically inaccessible. However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown.METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions.",Excluded
2659,"Targeting PARP-1 with alpha-particles is potently cytotoxic to human neuroblastoma in preclinical models Alpha-emitters can be pharmacologically delivered for irradiation of single cancer cells, but cellular lethality could be further enhanced by targeting alpha-emitters directly to the nucleus. PARP-1 is a druggable protein in the nucleus that is overexpressed in neuroblastoma compared with normal tissues and is associated with decreased survival in high-risk patients. To exploit this, we have functionalized a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) with an alpha-emitter astatine-211. This approach offers enhanced cytotoxicity from conventional PARPis by not requiring enzymatic inhibition of PARP-1 to elicit DNA damage; instead, the alpha-particle directly induces multiple double-strand DNA breaks across the particle track. Here, we explored the efficacy of [<sup>211</sup>At]MM4 in multiple cancers and found neuroblastoma to be highly sensitive in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, alpha-particles delivered to neuroblastoma show antitumor effects and durable responses in a neuroblastoma xenograft model, especially when administered in a fractionated regimen. This work provides the preclinical proof of concept for an alpha-emitting drug conjugate that directly targets cancer chromatin as a therapeutic approach for neuroblastoma and perhaps other cancers.

3632,"Associations among magnetic resonance spectroscopy, apparent diffusion coefficients, and image-guided histopathology with special attention to radiation necrosis OBJECTIVE: In patients with malignant glioma previously treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, clinical and radiographic signs of recurrent disease often require differentiation between radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor. Published work suggests that although magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can reliably differentiate pure tumor, pure necrosis, and spectroscopically normal tissues, it may not be particularly helpful because most patients have mixed histological findings comprised of necrosis and tumor. To improve our clinical ability to discriminate among these histological entities, we have analyzed MRS in conjunction with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences derived from magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS: In 18 patients, spectroscopic and diffusion-weighted images were obtained before surgery for suspected recurrent neoplastic disease. Spectral data for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were derived from 65 spectroscopic observations in patients with previously treated gliomas (n = 16) and metastatic tumors (n = 2). Spectral data for choline (Cho), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and lipid-lactate were analyzed separately and in conjunction with ADCs in all patients (15 observations of pure tumor, 33 observations of pure necrosis, and 13 observations of mixed tumor and necrosis). Histological specimens were obtained stereotactically at the time of surgery (<48 h after image acquisition) for recurrent disease and digitally co-registered with MRS data.RESULTS: ADC values for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were 1.30, 1.60, and 1.42, respectively. Cho/NAA less than 0.20, NAA/normal Cr greater than 1.56, and NAA/Cho greater than 1.32 increase the odds that a tissue biopsy will be pure necrosis versus mixed tumor and necrosis. Although various values of all MRS ratios analyzed may provide positive correlations for histopathological differentiation of tissue between that of pure tumor and that of pure necrosis, the addition of ADC values to only NAA/Cho and NAA/normal Cr increases the odds of correct differentiation between pure tumor and pure necrosis. The addition of ADC values does not provide additional information beyond that of MRS in distinguishing specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis from either pure tumor or pure necrosis.CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that MRS ratio analysis may allow for the clinical discrimination between specimens of pure tumor and pure necrosis, and the addition of ADC data into this analysis may enhance this specific differentiation. However, although a trend toward correlation between ADC values and the various histopathological features was noted, the direct addition of ADC data does not seem to allow further discrimination, beyond that provided by MRS, among specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis and either pure tumor or pure necrosis.",Excluded
2438,"CNS bioavailability and radiation protection of normal hippocampal neurogenesis by a lipophilic Mn porphyrin-based superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5</sup> Although radiation therapy can be effective against cancer, potential damage to normal tissues limits the amount that can be safely administered. In central nervous system (CNS), radiation damage to normal tissues is presented, in part, as suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired cognitive functions. Mn porphyrin (MnP)-based redox active drugs have demonstrated differential effects on cancer and normal tissues in experimental animals that lead to protection of normal tissues and radio- and chemo-sensitization of cancers. To test the efficacy of MnPs in CNS radioprotection, we first examined the tissue levels of three different MnPs - MnTE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnE), MnTnHex-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnHex), and MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnBuOE). Nanomolar concentrations of MnHex and MnBuOE were detected in various brain regions after daily subcutaneous administration, and MnBuOE was well tolerated at a daily dose of 3mg/kg. Administration of MnBuOE for one week before cranial irradiation and continued for one week afterwards supported production and long-term survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. MnP-driven S-glutathionylation in cortex and hippocampus showed differential responses to MnP administration and radiation in these two brain regions. A better understanding of how preserved hippocampal neurogenesis correlates with cognitive functions following cranial irradiation will be helpful in designing better MnP-based radioprotection strategies.",Excluded
2787,"Efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a biomedical cyclotron Copper-64 (T 1/2 = 12.7 h) is an intermediate-lived positron-emitting radionuclide that is a useful radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) as well as a promising radiotherapy agent for the treatment for cancer. Currently, copper-64 suitable for biomedical studies is produced in the fast neutron flux trap (irradiation of zinc with fast neutrons) at the Missouri University Research Reactor. Access to the fast neutron flux trap is only possible on a weekly basis, making the availability of this tracer very limited. In order to significantly increase the availability of this intermediate-lived radiotracer, we have investigated and developed a method for the efficient production of high specific activity Cu-64 using a small biomedical cyclotron. It has been suggested that it may be possible to produce Cu-64 on a small biomedical cyclotron utilizing the 64Ni(p,n)64Cu nuclear reaction. We have irradiated both natural nickel and enriched (95% and 98%) Ni-64 plated on gold disks. Nickel has been electroplated successfully at thicknesses of approximately 20-300 mm and bombarded with proton currents of 15-45 microA. A special water-cooled target had been designed to facilitate the irradiations on a biomedical cyclotron up to 60 microA. We have shown that it is possible to separate Cu-64 from Ni-64 and other reaction byproducts rapidly and efficiently by using ion exchange chromatography. Production runs using 19-55 mg of 95% enriched Ni-64 have yielded 150-600 mCi of Cu-64 (2.3-5.0 mCi/microAh) with specific activities of 94-310 mci/microgram Cu. The cyclotron produced Cu-64 had been used to radiolabel PTSM [pyruvaldehyde bis-(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone), used to quantify myocardial, cerebral, renal, and tumor blood flow], MAb 1A3 [monoclonal antibody MAb to colon cancer], and octreotide. A recycling technique for the costly Ni-64 target material has been developed. This technique allows the nickel eluted off the column to be recovered and reused in the electroplating of new targets with an overall efficiency of greater than 90%.",Excluded
3539,"Functional protection of photoreceptors from light-induced damage by dimethylthiourea and Ginkgo biloba extract PURPOSE: To investigate the functional protective effect of a synthetic (dimethylthiourea, DMTU) and a natural antioxidant (Ginkgo biloba extract, EGb 761) against light-induced retinal degeneration.METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed for 24 hours to 1700-lux light after treatment with DMTU or EGb 761. Electroretinograms were recorded before and on day (D)1, D3, D8, D15, D22, and D29 after light exposure. The b-wave amplitude was plotted against log L (ganzfeld luminance), providing the b-wave sensitivity curve. The Naka-Rushton function fitted to the sensitivity curve enabled derivation of the parameters Bmax (saturated amplitude) and K (luminance-inducing Bmax/2). In addition, rats from each group were killed for retinal morphometric analyses.RESULTS: In the untreated group, light exposure caused collapse of the b-wave sensitivity curves. Bmax was reduced by 51% at D1 without subsequent recovery. K increased temporarily, reverting to normal values 8 days later. The outer nuclear layer thicknesses decreased markedly in the superior retina. In the treated groups, light exposure had a weaker effect on sensitivity curves. The values of Bmax were not significantly different from those in the unexposed-untreated group, although K increased temporarily. Retinal morphometry was preserved.CONCLUSIONS: Dimethylthiourea and EGb 761 afford functional protection against light-induced retinal damage.",Excluded
3373,"First in Human Clinical Trial of a Metalloporphyrin Dual Radioprotectant and Radiosensitizer, BMX-001, in Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiation Purpose/Objective(s): The metalloporphyrin, BMX-001 (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>), uniquely protects normal tissues from radiation damage and sensitizes tumor cells to radiation damage. We demonstrated this dual action in preclinical models where it protected white matter from radiation damage but augmented radiation-induced cell kill in human glioblastoma (GBM) xenografts. Therefore, we performed a phase 1 study to evaluate safety of BMX-001 in newly diagnosed patients with HGG receiving concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). Materials/Methods: This clinical trial was an IRB-approved, phase 1, single-center, dose-escalation study of BMX-001 in combination with concurrent RT (daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy to a total of 59.4-60 Gy) and TMZ (75 mg/m2 daily X 42 days). We delivered BMX-001 via subcutaneous injection at a loading dose before the start of RT/TMZ and then 2 times/week for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and neurocognition. We defined progression-free survival and overall survival as survival from time of first BMX-001 injection until progression and death, respectively, and calculated both based on Kaplan-Meier analyses. Result(s): There were 15 evaluable subjects in the phase 1 study that received all planned BMX-001 doses. All 15 subjects had GBM (WHO grade IV) with age range of 19 to 80 years. BMX-001 at 28 mg loading dose and 14 mg subsequent dose was the MTD. Sinus tachycardia (grade 3) was the dose-limiting toxicity at 42 mg loading dose (n=1). The only other related grade >= 3 event was hypotension (grade 3, n=1). The most common related toxicity was grade 1 injection site reaction (n=7). Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (95% CI: 8.9, -). Progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% CI: 3.9, 11.4). Overall survival was 23.4 months (95% CI: 11.2, 25.9) with seven GBM patients still alive at the time of this analysis. At time of this analysis, long-term results of neurocognition are pending. Conclusion(s): BMX-001 was safe to administer during concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG. Early results of survival analyses are promising, and long-term neurocognitive protection remains to be determined. Thus, we launched a multi-institutional Phase 2 study with BMX-001 in combination with concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG with key endpoints including overall survival and neurocognition and exploratory endpoints examining white matter integrity and health-related quality of life. Clinical trials are underway also for utilization of BMX-001 with radiation therapy for patients with head and neck cancer and brain metastases. Copyright © 2019",Excluded
2783,"A preliminary comparative treatment planning study for radiotherapy of age-related maculopathy PURPOSE: We present a comparative planning of different approaches for external radiotherapy in age-related maculopathies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calculated dose distributions and dose-volume histograms for (a) bilateral irradiation with 6 MV photons, (b) a single lateral-oblique beam using either photons, electrons or protons and (c) an anterior circular proton beam.RESULTS: For lateral photon or electron beams the dose to the lens is usually lower than 10% of the dose to the macula. The entrance doses for bilateral photon beams are about 50% which increase up to 100% at the orbital bone. About 5 mm of optic nerves are irradiated at the maximal dose while the optic chiasma is spared. A single photon beam gives 50% of the dose to the fellow eye. The electron beam spares the fellow eye but gives a rather inhomogeneous dose to the target volume. For a lateral proton beam, 4 mm of optic nerve receives 90% of the dose, the skin dose is at least 70% of the dose to the macula and the lens and the fellow eye are spared. An anterior proton beam gives 90% of the dose to 1 mm of optic nerve and the 50% isodose approaches the periphery of the lens.CONCLUSION: Doses to the critical structures can be dramatically diminished for all the techniques by reducing the beam size, but only if very precise set-up techniques are used. Proton beams are an attractive solution, but the impact of such a choice on the use of proton facilities and on the national health system should be carefully evaluated, as well as the risk of radio-induced secondary neoplasias.",Excluded
3309,"Neuroradiographic changes following convection-enhanced delivery of the recombinant cytotoxin interleukin 13-PE38QQR for recurrent malignant glioma OBJECT: Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a novel method for delivering therapeutic agents to infiltrative brain tumor cells. For agents administered by CED, changes on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging directly resulting from catheter placement, infusion, and the therapeutic compound may confound any interpretation of tumor progression. As part of an ongoing multiinstitutional Phase I study, 14 patients with recurrent malignant glioma underwent CED of interleukin (IL) 13-PE38QQR, a recombinant cytotoxin consisting of human IL-13 conjugated with a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. Serial neuroradiographic changes were assessed in this cohort of patients. METHOD(S): Patients were treated in two groups: Group 1 patients received IL13-PE38QQR before and after tumor resection; Group 2 patients received infusion only after tumor resection. Preoperative and postinfusion MR images were obtained prospectively at specified regular intervals. Changes were noted along catheter tracks on postresection MR images obtained in all patients. A simple grading system was developed to describe these changes. When MR imaging changes appeared to be related to IL1 3-PE38QQR, patients were followed up without instituting new antitumor therapy. CONCLUSION(S): As CED of therapeutic agents becomes more common, clinicians and investigators must become aware of associated neuroimaging changes that should be incorporated into toxicity assessment. We have developed a simple grading system to facilitate communication about these changes among investigators. Biological imaging modalities that could possibly distinguish these changes from recurrent tumor should be evaluated. In this study the authors demonstrate the challenges in determining efficacy when surrogate end points such as time to tumor progression as defined by new or progressive contrast enhancement on MR imaging are used with this treatment modality.",Excluded

This radiotracer displayed good brain penetration (3.1% of the injected dose (ID) in whole brain at 15 min post-radioligand injection). Radioligand distribution was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus (14.9 %ID/g at 60 min), moderate uptake in cortex (8.5 %ID/g at 60 min), and lowest uptake in the cerebellum (2.4 %ID/g at 60 min). Pretreatment with several different nAChR agonists (A-85380, (-)-nicotine, cytisine) significantly inhibited [I-125]-5-IA binding in all brain regions studied (P < 0.01) demonstrating the high specificity of the radioligand for nAChRs. Blocking doses of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the non-competitive nAChR channel blocker mecamylamine had no significant effect on radioactive uptake supporting the in vitro selectivity of [I-125]-5-IA for the nAChR component of the cholinergic system. [I-125]-5-IA binding sites were shown to be saturable with unlabeled 5-IA.

3497,"Possible fractionated regimens for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy of large arteriovenous malformations The aim of this study was to estimate a plausible alpha/beta ratio for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) based on reported clinical data, and to design possible fractionation regimens suitable for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) for large AVMs based on the newly obtained alpha/beta ratio. The commonly used obliteration rate (OR) for AVMs with a three year angiographic follow-up from many institutes was fitted to linear-quadratic (LQ) formalism and the Poisson OR model. The determined parameters were then used to calculate possible fractionation regimens for IG-IMRT based on the concept of a biologically effective dose (BED) and an equivalent uniform dose (EUD). The radiobiological analysis yields a alpha/beta ratio of 2.2 +/- 1.6 Gy for AVMs. Three sets of possible fractionated schemes were designed to achieve equal or better biological effectiveness than the single-fraction treatments while maintaining the same probability of normal brain complications. A plausible alpha/beta ratio was derived for AVMs and possible fractionation regimens that may be suitable for IG-IMRT for large AVM treatment are proposed.

2666,"Mechanisms of action for an anti-radiation vaccine in reducing the biological impact of high dose and dose-rate, low-linear energy transfer radiation exposure The development of an anti-radiation vaccine could be very useful in reducing acute radiation syndromes. Existing principles for the treatment of acute radiation syndromes are based on the amelioration of progressive pathophysiological changes, using the concept of replacement therapy. Active immunization by small quantities of the essential radiation-induced systemic toxins of what we call the Specific Radiation Determinant (SRD) before irradiation increased duration of life among animals that were irradiated by lethal or sub-lethal doses of gamma-radiation. The SRD toxins possess antigenic properties that are specific to different forms of acute radiation sickness. Intramuscular injection of larger quantities of the SRD toxins induce signs and symptoms in irradiated naive animals similar to those observed in acute radiation syndromes, including death. Providing passive immunization, at variable periods of time following radiation, with preparations of immune-globulins directed at the SRD molecules, can confer some protection in the development of clinical sequelae in irradiated animals. Improved survival rates and times were observed in animals that received lower, sublethal doses of the same SRDs prior to irradiation. Therefore, active immunization can be induced by SRD molecules as a prophylaxis. The protective effects of the immunization begin to manifest 15-35 days after an injection of a biologically active SDR preparation. The SRD molecules are a group of radiation toxins with antigenic properties that correlate specifically with different forms of radiation disease. The SRD molecules are composed of glycoproteins and lipoproteins that accumulate in the lymphatic system of mammals in the first hours after irradiation, and preliminary analysis suggests that they may originate from cellular membrane components. The molecular weight of the SRD group ranges from 200-250 kDa. The SRD molecules were isolated from the lymphatic systems of laboratory animals that were irradiated with doses known to induce the development of cerebral (SRD-1), non-specific toxic effects (SRD-2), gastrointestinal (SRD-3) and hematological (bone marrow) (SRD-4) syndromes. Our results suggest that an anti-radiation vaccine can be developed for prophylactic use against radiation damage induced by acute exposure to significant doses of low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation for humans, including nuclear power workers, commercial and military pilots, cosmonauts/astronauts, nuclear-powered engine vessel operators and possibly even the civilian population in the case of a nuclear terrorism event.",Excluded
3175,"Iodinated contrast agent time course in human brain metastasis: A study for synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy clinical trials Purpose/Objective(s): Synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy (SSRT) is an innovative treatment combining the selective accumulation of heavy elements in tumors with stereotactic irradiations using monochromatic medium energy x-rays from a synchrotron source. Phase I/II clinical trials on brain metastasis are underway using venous infusion of iodinated contrast agents. The radiation dose enhancement depends on the amount of iodine in the tumor and its time course. Quantitative, post-infusion iodine bio-distribution and associated brain perfusion parameters were studied in human brain metastasis as key parameters for treatment feasibility and quality. The reproducibility of iodine concentrations between the recruitment day and the treatment day was assessed in order to predict dose errors. Materials/Methods: Twelve patients received an intravenous bolus of iodinated contrast agent (40 mL, 4 mL/s), followed by a steady-state infusion (160 mL, 0.5 mL/s) in order to ensure stable intratumoral amounts of iodine during the treatment. Absolute iodine concentrations and quantitative perfusion maps were derived from 40 multi-slice dynamic conventional CT images of the brain (recruitment day) or from quantitative synchrotron radiation CT (treatment day). For three of these patients, iodine concentrations reached in the tumor were compared between the recruitment day and the treatment day (~ 10 days interval). Result(s): The post-infusion mean intratumoral iodine concentration (over thirty minutes) reached 1.94 +/- 0.12 mg/mL. Reasonable correlations were obtained between these concentrations and the permeability surface area product and the cerebral blood volume. Iodine concentrations were reproducible leading to dose errors in the radiotherapy standards. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of contrast agent biodistribution versus time in brain metastasis. The study demonstrates that suitable and stable amounts of iodine can be reached in brain metastasis for SSRT treatment.

Program Description: The patient was referred to the clinic by his oncologist for evaluation of bilateral shoulder pain. He had recently undergone esophagectomy with right thoracotomy. Before surgery, the patient had no shoulder pain; after surgery, he developed severe pain and restricted range of motion in the bilateral shoulders, worse on the right side. He had difficulty with overhead reaching and use of his right upper limb in activities of daily living. On examination, he was noted to have significant winging of the right scapula along the medial border when at rest and with a wall pushup, an inability to forward flex the right shoulder past 80degree and abduct past 70degree, atrophy of the right posterior shoulder girdle, and a large well-healed scar along the right lateral scapular border. Setting(s): Outpatient musculoskeletal clinic. Result(s): An electromyography and nerve conduction study was performed and revealed both long thoracic and spinal accessory neuropathy. Subsequent ultrasound imaging of the shoulder revealed a neuroma deep to the scar in the right mid axillary line, suspicious for a laceration of the long thoracic nerve. The patient was referred to the orthotics department to be fitted for a scapulothoracic orthosis. Discussion(s): Although rare, scapular winging can present after surgery due to traumatic, iatrogenic, or idiopathic factors. Prior studies have shown that postoperative scapular winging can have a neurogenic etiology, with isolated injury to the long thoracic, spinal accessory, or dorsal scapular nerve.

Results were evaluated in comparison with those of the sham-irradiated (30, 60, 120 min) control groups of rats. From the results it follows that the concentration of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the rat pineal gland significantly decreased 30 and 120 minutes after irradiation (p < 0.01). At min 60 of the postirradiation period it was possible to observe a tendency to recovery of the levels of DA and NE to control values. Epinephrine (EPI) exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) decrease at min 60 and 120 of postirradiation (by 61.8% and 62.8%, respectively).",Included
2626,"Randomized trial of palliative two-fraction versus more intensive 13-fraction radiotherapy for patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer and good performance status. Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party In patients with non-metastatic but inoperable non-small cell lung cancer that is locally too extensive for radical radiotherapy (RT), but who have good performance status, it is important to determine whether thoracic RT should be the minimum that is required to palliate thoracic symptoms or whether treatment should be more intensive, with the aim of prolonging survival. A total of 509 such patients from 11 centres in the UK between November 1989 and October 1992 were admitted to a trial comparing palliative versus more intensive RT with respect to survival and quality of life. They were allocated at random to receive thoracic RT with either 17 Gy in two fractions (F2) 1 week apart (255 patients) or 39 Gy in 13 fractions (F13) 5 days per week (254 patients). Survival was better in the F13 group, the median survival periods being 7 months in the F2 group compared with 9 months in the F13 group, and the survival rates 31% and 36% at one year and 9% and 12% at 2 years, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% CI0.69-0.99). There was a suggestion of a trend towards greater benefit in fitter patients. Metastases appeared earlier in the F2 group. As recorded by patients using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the commonest symptoms on admission were cough, shortness of breath, tiredness, lack of energy, worrying and chest pain. These were more rapidly palliated by the F2 regimen. Psychological distress was generally lower in the F13 group. Three patients (two F13, one F2) exhibited evidence of myelopathy. As recorded by patients using a diary card, 76% of the F2 compared with 81% of the F13 patients had dysphagia associated with their RT. This was transient, lasting for a median of 6.5 days in the F2 group compared with 14 days in the F13 group. In conclusion, the F2 regimen had a more rapid palliative effect. In the F13 group, although treatment-related dysphagia was worse, survival was longer.",Excluded
2447,"Unmyelinated visceral afferents exhibit frequency dependent action potential broadening while myelinated visceral afferents do not Sensory information arising from visceral organ systems is encoded into action potential trains that propagate along afferent fibers to target nuclei in the central nervous system. These information streams range from tight patterns of action potentials that are well synchronized with the sensory transduction event to irregular, patternless discharge with no clear correlation to the sensory input. In general terms these afferent pathways can be divided into unmyelinated and myelinated fiber types. Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the functional differences between these two types of afferents in terms of the preprocessing of sensory information into action potential trains (synchrony, frequency, duration, etc.), the reflexogenic consequences of this sensory input to the central nervous system and the ionic channels that give rise to the electrophysiological properties of these unique cell types. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any functional differences in the somatic action potential characteristics of unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents in response to different rates of sensory nerve stimulation. Our results showed that activity and frequency-dependent widening of the somatic action potential was quite prominent in unmyelinated but not myelinated vagal afferents. Spike broadening often leads to increased influx of Ca(2+) ions that has been associated with a diverse range of modulatory mechanisms both at the cell body and central synaptic terminations (e.g. increased neurotransmitter release.) We conclude that our observations are indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms for neural integration of sensory information arising from unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents.",Excluded
3076,Post-mortem observation of glioma and/or brain tissue compared to C-T scan findings after irradiation. [Japanese] C-T scan findings in glioma and brain tissue after irradiation were histopathologically analyzed with the post-mortem examination of 4 patients. High density of contrast enhancement observed in gliomas mainly corresponded to proliferation of irregular blood vessels and hypodensity reflected less cellular area or necrotic foci in the tumor tissue. A mottled lesion with high density margin in C-T of radionecrosis of the brain tissue observed in a non-glioma patient was formed by coagulation necrosis showing marked proliferation of telangiectatic blood vessels in periphery of lesion and acellular area in the center. It is occasionally impossible to differentiate the findings between delayed radionecrosis of brain and recurrence of glioma using the C-T criteria alone.,Excluded
3622,"Avoidance of radiation induced alopecia en whole brain radiotherapy treatments with simultaneous integrated boost Purpose/Objective: Radiation-induced alopecia in hypofractionated whole brain radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost (WBRT+SIB) is an understudied issue, even in RTOG 9508. However, this effect has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients. We have currently found a technical solution to this problem. Our current protocol for WBRT+SIB is presented and described, incluiding a retrospective review of the results in relation to radiation-induced alopecia. Material(s) and Method(s): The protocol already implemented in our department is based on a frame-less procedure compatible with masks of type 35764/2MA/M (Orfit Industries N.V., Wijnegem, Belgium), submasks of eXaSkin (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain) and a resonance compatible frame eXaFrame (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain). CT and MR studies of 1mm slice thickness are acquired with similar length, position and inmovilization. The whole procedure and the resulting high quality fussion is ensured by the eXaFrame system. Treatments were designed using VMAT in Treatment System Planning Pinnacle V.9.2 (Philips N.V, Koninklijke Holland) with multiple arcs, and delivered with a linear accelerator Elekta Synergy (Elekta A.B., Stockholm, Sweden). The dose scheme used is the one reported by Lagerwaard: [WBRT(20Gy) + SIBmts (40Gy)]/5 fr. Patient positioning is verified daily using IGRT with Elekta XVI, before and after treatment. Before optimization is performed, some auxiliary volumes are created: a 3mm ring around calota,called Follicles, and a volume contracted 12mm from the outer one, called CPE. Two CCW VMAT arcs (178degree to 60degree and 300degree to 182degree) are added, with the following objectives: Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 1), brain-CPE (D<inf>max</inf>= 21 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 20 Gy, weight = 50), eyes(D<inf>max</inf>= 10 Gy, weight = 1). Thereafter, we work separately on the metastases blocking the optimization of the prophylaxis and creating three structures: VI1 = PTV (MTS1)+ 5 mm, VI2 = PTV (MTS2)+ 5 mm, Epx = brain-VI1-VI2. Objectives were: PTVI (D<inf>max</inf>= 44 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 40 Gy weight = 50), Epx (D<inf>max</inf>= 30 Gy) ,brain stem (D<inf>max</inf>= 23 Gy) and Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 20). Result(s): We have treated 14 patients until now. Fusion images have shown differences less than 1mm while mean IGRT correction has been 1.34mm. No acute toxicity have been observed, including neither alopecia nor temporal depilation. Conclusion(s): This protocol has been designed and developed in our hospital, considering the alopecia as toxicity in VMAT optimization. It produces excellent cosmetic results, avoiding alopecia in practically all cases, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. As a general consideration, we would like to point out that that it should be considered mandatory to use all advanced tools available on modern radiotherapy to minimize toxicity in radiation treatments.",Excluded
2600,"Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion aided with computer-assisted spinal navigation system combined with electromyography monitoring BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive techniques are gaining wide-spread application in lumbar fusion surgery, because they may have advantage over conventional open surgery in approach-related morbidity. This research was aimed to evaluate the safety and accuracy of the techniques of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion by using a computer-assisted spinal navigation system combined with electromyography monitoring.METHODS: Sixteen patients underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. A computer-assisted spinal navigation system and electromyography were used for guiding pedicle screw placement. The operative duration, blood loss, complications, and fluoroscopic time were recorded. Clinical outcome was assessed by Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index. Radiographic images were obtained to evaluate the accuracy of pedicle screw placement and fusion rates.RESULTS: The Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores were vastly improved postoperatively. A total of 64 pedicle screws were implanted and three were regarded as misplacement by post-operative CT scan. Three screw trajectories were adjusted according to intra-operative stimulus-evoked electromyography monitoring. The average fluoroscopy time in each patient was 31.8 seconds, which equals to 7.9 seconds per pedicle screw. No patients had instrument related neurological complications, infection, implant failure or revision. Successful fusion was found in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of navigation system and real-time electromyography monitoring can make the minimally invasive operation more safe and accurate while decreasing radiation exposure time of the medical staff and patient and minimizing the chance and the degree of the pedicle screw misplacement.",Excluded
3483,"Radiation arteritis: a contraindication to carotid stenting? BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) for high-risk anatomic lesions is accepted practice. Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis.",Included

Goal: To explore features and cerebral basis of ""radiation"" PTSD in the Chernobyl accident survivors. Subjects and methods: The cross-sectional study included 241 people, 219 of whom have been diagnosed with PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, among them 115 clean-up workers [liquidators] of the Chernobyl accident (34 with acute radiation sickness), 76 evacuees from the Chernobyl exclusion zone, 28 veterans of the war in Afghanistan, and 22 healthy unexposed individuals. Psychometric examinations, neurocognitive assessments, computerized electroencephalography, and cerebral vascular Doppler were used. Result(s): ""Radiation"" PTSD includes: ""flashforward"" phenomenon and anticipating stress (projection of fear and danger to the future); somatoform disorders, depression, trait and state anxiety; neurocognitive deficit (impaired memory and attention, auditory-verbal memory and learning, proactive and retroactive interference; cerebellar and stem symptoms, intellectual changes). The intima-media component thickness of common carotid arteries, and common and left internal carotid arteries stenosis rates are increased in the liquidators. Changes of bioelectrical brain activity as a decrease of beta- and theta-power together with an increase of alpha-power were found in the Chernobyl accident survivors with PTSD. Conclusion(s): PTSD following radiation emergency is characterized by comorbidity of psychopathology, neurocognitive deficit, and cerebrovascular pathology with increased risk of cerebral atherosclerosis and stroke. Cerebral basis of this PTSD is proposed to be an abnormal communication between the pyramidal cells of neocortex and hippocampus, and deep brain structures.",Included
3502,"Intracellular analysis of reflex pathways underlying the stumbling corrective reaction during fictive locomotion in the cat In cat and humans, contact between an obstacle and the dorsum of the foot evokes the stumbling corrective reaction (reflex) that lifts the foot to avoid falling. This reflex can also be evoked by short trains of stimuli to the cutaneous superficial peroneal (SP) nerve in decerebrate cats during the flexion phase of fictive locomotion. Here we examine intracellular events in hindlimb motoneurons accompanying stumbling correction. SP stimulation delivered during the flexion phase excites knee flexor motoneurons at short latency [minimum excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) latency 1.8 ms; mean 2.7 ms]. Although a similar short latency excitation occurs in ankle extensors (mean latency, 2.8 ms), recruitment is delayed until successive shocks in the stimulus train overcome the locomotor-related hyperpolarization of ankle extensors. In ankle flexor motoneurons, SP stimulation evokes an inhibition (mean latency, 2.7 ms) that briefly reduces or stops their firing during the flexion phase. There is a phase-dependent modulation of SP-evoked EPSP amplitude as well as latency during locomotion. However, the more obvious change in SP reflex pathways with the onset of fictive locomotion is the reduced inhibition of ankle extensor motoneurons and the increased inhibition of ankle flexors. These results show that the characteristic pattern of hindlimb motoneuron activation during SP nerve-evoked stumbling correction results from 1) di- and trisynaptic excitation of knee flexor and ankle extensor motoneurons; 2) increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in ankle flexors and a suppression of inhibition in extensors, 3) sculpting of the short-latency SP postsynaptic effects by motoneuron membrane potential, and 4) longer latency excitatory effects that are likely evoked by lumbar interneurons involved in the generation of fictive locomotion.",Excluded

3529,"A study on neuromodulation for optimizing subthalamic-nuclei stimulating effect of varied frequency parameters to enhance the gait with dual tasking in parkinson's disease Introduction: Gait disturbances and freezing-episodes are broad in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and they worsen with dual (also multi) tasking. In PD, though, subthalamic-nuclei deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective-restorative-therapeutic option for enhancing motor, freezing-of-gait (FoG) and other axial-symptoms, albeit, its impact on gait-disturbances is hazy. Studies [1] suggest that low frequencies can augment gait-parameters provided frequency-parameters (including stimulation-intensity and pulse-width) are changed. Materials/Methods: 40Parkinson's post STN-DBS patients with gaitdisturbances were included in the study. All patients were on constant neurostimulation-parameters and dopaminergic-medication for a month prior to assessment. Gait-parameters were analyzed during-medication 'on' and DBS 'on' state, at 4 classes-of-frequencies 180Hz,130Hz,90Hz, and at 60Hz and DBS 'off' medication 'on' state. Gait was analyzed using stand-walk-sit (SWS) test and freezing-of-gait (FoG) scales. Total elapsed-times, number of steps/freezing episodes were analyzed in SWS test. Effect of dual-tasking on gait was analyzed using FoG score. While analyzing-parameters at differentfrequencies, Wilcoxon signed rank-test was employed. Result(s): 40Parkinson's on neuromodulation were studied, out of which 29 were male. Average mean-age was 55.45+10.76 years. Mean-duration of disease at the onset was 13.13+6.41 years. Post-surgery mean-duration was 3.58+2.4 years. 38Parkinson's showed significant-improvement in gait at a single-frequency, which was singular for each patient while 2patients showed optimal-response at two frequencies. In SWS-test, 17patients (42.5%) had good-response at 180Hz, 6(15%) at 130Hz,14(46.7%) at 90Hz,5 (12.5%) at 60Hz. [Table 1] Total FoG-scores and sub-scores based on dualtask also improved at similar frequencies. Discussion(s): Statistically-significant-improvement in all gait-parameters including dual-tasking at best-frequency in comparison to DBS 'off' and 130Hz, with chi2= 9.2857 with 2 degree-of-freedom, highly-significant at 5% (<0.0001). [Table 2] Optimal-frequency was independent of any demographic parameters, disease-severity or duration or other stimulation parameters [Fig 1]. There is a significant-effect of varying stimulation-frequencyparameters. The frequency-modulation certainly help PD patients with FoG and also axial-symptoms (particularly in case of bilateral STN-DBS). Conclusion(s): Optimization of frequency-parameter-setting for each Parkinson can recover gait yet with a cognitive-load. High and lowfrequencies may be of use and needs to be individualized. We also suggest that bilateral STN-stimulation enhances in case of the majority of axial-symptoms of Parkinson's and that a synergistic-result can be attained when DBS is used in concurrence with L-dopa.

The control group sustained a one-minute clip compression (force of clip was 30 g) injury of the spinal cord at the T2 level, without X-irradiation. The experimental group received X-irradiation 14 days after injury. Neurological function was assessed by the modified Tarlov method, including hind limbs movement, inclined plane, and pain withdrawal. These tests were performed in a blinded fashion at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after injury. At 43 days after injury, histological examination of the injured spinal cord was performed following decapitation of the rats.RESULTS: Sixty-two rats met the experimental requirements (spinal cord injury was similar), 32 rats in experimental group and 30 rats in control group. Statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in hind limbs movement and inclined plane (P < 0.01), but not in the pain withdrawal test. The edema and necrosis areas of injured spinal cords in experimental group were less than those in control group, and axons in experimental group were significantly more than those in control group (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Delayed X-irradiation following spinal cord injury may enhance functional recovery by improving and restoring structural integrity of the injured spinal cord in rats.",Excluded
2618,"Quetiapine attenuates cognitive impairment and decreases seizure susceptibility possibly through promoting myelin development in a rat model of malformations of cortical development Developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and refractory epilepsy are the most frequent consequences found in patients suffering from malformations of cortical development (MCD). However, therapeutic options for these psychiatric and neurological comorbidities are currently limited. The development of white matter undergoes dramatic changes during postnatal brain maturation, thus myelination deficits resulting from MCD contribute to its comorbid diseases. Consequently, drugs specifically targeting white matter are a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of MCD. We have used an in utero irradiation rat model of MCD to investigate the effects of postnatal quetiapine treatment on brain myelination as well as neuropsychological and cognitive performances and seizure susceptibility. Fatally irradiated rats were treated with quetiapine (10mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P30. We found that postnatal administration of quetiapine attenuated object recognition memory impairment and improved long-term spatial memory in the irradiated rats. Quetiapine treatment also reduced the susceptibility and severity of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Importantly, quetiapine treatment resulted in an inhibition of irradiation-induced myelin breakdown in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum. These findings suggest that quetiapine may have beneficial, postnatal effects in the irradiated rats, strongly suggesting that improving MCD-derived white matter pathology is a possible underlying mechanism. Collectively, these results indicate that brain myelination represents an encouraging pharmacological target to improve the prognosis of patients with MCD.",Excluded

2664,"85. Comparison of novel machine vision image guidance system with a 3D fluoroscopy-based platform for pedicle screw placement: a randomized prospective study of radiation, accuracy, and cost BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The use of image guidance and robotics platforms has increased patient safety, accuracy and operative efficiency and reduced revision rates during pedicle screw placement procedures. However, traditional intraoperative 3D or computational tomography (CT) imaging produces potentially harmful ionizing radiation and increases operative time to register the patient. An image guidance platform using machine vision through high resolution stereoscopic cameras and structured visible light does not use ionizing radiation while it builds a 3D topographical map of the patient's anatomy for navigation use. PURPOSE: We aimed to compare a novel machine vision image guidance system (MvIGS) system to a widely used 3D fluoroscopy (3D) platform by comparing radiation exposure, and pedicle screw accuracy. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A randomized prospective comparative cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing posterior lumbar instrumented fusion. PATIENT SAMPLE: Adults diagnosed with a spinal condition requiring surgical treatment and planning to have posterior open lumbar fusion with pedicle screws implanted into 1-4 vertebral levels. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included: mean intraoperative fluoroscopy time and dose, mean preoperative CT dose length product (DLP) and mean day 2 postoperative CT DLP, pedicle screw accuracy and rate of revision surgery. METHOD(S): Patients were randomized 1:1 to MvIGS or 3D and underwent posterior lumbar instrumented fusion. Radiation doses were recorded from pre- and postoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy. Independent blinded radiologists reviewed pedicle screw accuracy. RESULT(S): A total of 303 (154 MvIGS, 149 3D) pedicle screws were placed in 63 patients (33 MvIGS, 30 3D) over the 12-month study period. Mean age and indication for surgery were similar between both groups. Mean intraoperative fluoroscopy time and doses were significantly reduced in MvIGS compared to 3D (5.2+/-4.1s vs 79.6+/-23.3s, p<0.001 and 133.0+/-215.8cGycm2 vs 3704.1+/-1640.5cGycm2, p<0.001, respectively). This represents a relative reduction of 93.5% in the total intraoperative time and 96.4% reduction in the total dose. Mean preoperative CT DLP and mean day 2 postoperative CT DLP were significantly reduced in MvIGS compared to 3D (590.8+/-389.6mGy*cm vs 1008.9+/-616.3mGy*cm, p<0.001 and 518.1+/-205.6mGy*cmvs 958.7+/-449.6mGy*cm, p<0.001, respectively). This represents a relative reduction of 41.4% and 46.0% relative reduction in the preoperative CT dose and postoperative total DLP, respectively. The MvIGS group required an average of 1.2 registrations each case with an average of 2447 (SD=961.3) data points registered with mean registration time of 106s (SD=52.1s). A rapid re-registration mechanism was utilized in 22% (n=7/33) of cases. Pedicle screw accuracy was high in both groups MvIGS (98.7%) vs 3D (97.3%) with no pedicle breach >2mm in either group (p>0.001). No neurovascular injuries occurred, and no patients needed return to theatre for screw repositioning. CONCLUSION(S): Both MvIGS and 3D image guidance platforms demonstrated high accuracy for pedicle screw placement. MvIGS demonstrated significant reduction of 93.5% and 96.4% in intraoperative radiation time and dose. MvIGS may provide similar accuracy to contemporary image guidance platforms without requiring 3D fluoroscopy or radiolucent operating tables. Reducing registration times and the need for specialized equipment may significantly reduce operating room costs.

However, there is now sufficient evidence supporting the use of SRS for the difficult cases.

We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included

2555,"[Ultrastructure of the pinealocytes in rats exposed to light and radiation] Changes in pinealocytes (PC) were analysed using quantitative electron microscopy in 240 adult male rats from first minutes up to 180 days after their continuous exposure to bright light (CLE) for 48 hours, X-ray irradiation (XRI) or their combination (CE). After CLE early changes of PC included the reduction of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi complex and synaptic ribbons. At 24 hours and 10 days PC secretory activity was increased, while their ultrastructural organization was normalized by 30-180 days. 10 days after XRI degenerative changes were detected in PC that included dilation, fragmentation and vacuolization of RER cisterns, mitochondrial swelling, appearance of large vacuoles and osmiophilic inclusions, increase in lysosome content. Volume density of mitochondria and RER was lower, while that of Golgi complex was higher than in control. PC ultrastructure was restored 30-180 days after XRI. Following CE, the changes in PC ultrastructural organization were more significant at all time interval studied than after the action of single factors. The results obtained indicate that CLE increased the extent of postradiation changes in PC ultrastructural organization during the early time intervals after XRI and at the peak of radiation sickness development.",Included
3604,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]raclopride in healthy volunteers PURPOSE: This study reports on the whole-body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist.METHODS: In three healthy male volunteers, whole-body scans were performed up to 2 h following i.v. injection of 320+/-65 MBq [11C]raclopride. Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study. The kidneys, urinary bladder wall, liver and gall-bladder received the highest absorbed doses. The average effective dose of [11C]raclopride was estimated to be 6.7+/-0.4 microSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: The amount of [11C]raclopride required for adequate dopamine D2 receptor imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent, permitting two or three repeated clinical PET imaging studies, with the injection of 222 MBq for each study.",Excluded
2920,"The effects of the g-quadruplex ligand telomestatin to human brain tumor stem cell survival and growth Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the leading cause of death among primary brain tumors in adults and the current therapies have only palliative effect on prognosis of patients. Recently, stem cell-like cells in GBM (brain tumor stem-like cells; BTSC) have gained substantial attention as a potential therapeutic target. Hallmarks of BTSC include their self-renewal capacity and highly migratory potential. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of patient-derived BTSC with a G-quadruplex ligand, telomestatin (TMS), inhibits BTSC self-renewal and maintenance of their stem cell state, and induces their apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, both normal precursors and non-stem tumor cells from the matched samples are relatively resistant to TMS treatment. Treatment with a lower dose of TMS specifically inhibits BTSC migration into normal brain. Immunofluorescence in situ hybridization with TMS-treated GBM cells displays both telomeric and non-telomeric DNA damage in BTSC but not in non-stem tumor cells. cDNA microarray analysis identifies a proto-oncogene, c-Myb, as a target of TMS in BTSC, and the pharmacodynamic analysis with TMS-treated tumor-bearing mouse brains demonstrates reduction of c-Myb expression in tumors. An elevated c-Myb expression is found in surgical specimens of GBM compared to normal brain tissues. Lastly, TMS treatment of BTSC-derived mouse intracranial tumors reduces tumor sizes in vivo without any noticeable apoptotic cells in the normal brain, and a combined treatment of TMS with radiation or temozolomide results in additive inhibitory effects on GBM sphere growth in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate a potential avenue toward BTSC-directed therapeutic strategy using TMS via telomeric DNA damage and inhibition of c-Myb, which may offer a novel therapeutic approach for GBM.",Excluded
3247,"Impact of image denoising on image quality, quantitative parameters and sensitivity of ultra-low-dose volume perfusion CT imaging OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of denoising on ultra-low-dose volume perfusion CT (ULD-VPCT) imaging in acute stroke.METHODS: Simulated ULD-VPCT data sets at 20 % dose rate were generated from perfusion data sets of 20 patients with suspected ischemic stroke acquired at 80 kVp/180 mAs. Four data sets were generated from each ULD-VPCT data set: not-denoised (ND); denoised using spatiotemporal filter (D1); denoised using quanta-stream diffusion technique (D2); combination of both methods (D1 + D2). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured in the resulting 100 data sets. Image quality, presence/absence of ischemic lesions, CBV and CBF scores according to a modified ASPECTS score were assessed by two blinded readers.RESULTS: SNR and qualitative scores were highest for D1 + D2 and lowest for ND (all p <= 0.001). In 25 % of the patients, ND maps were not assessable and therefore excluded from further analyses. Compared to original data sets, in D2 and D1 + D2, readers correctly identified all patients with ischemic lesions (sensitivity 1.0, kappa 1.0). Lesion size was most accurately estimated for D1 + D2 with a sensitivity of 1.0 (CBV) and 0.94 (CBF) and an inter-rater agreement of 1.0 and 0.92, respectively.CONCLUSION: An appropriate combination of denoising techniques applied in ULD-VPCT produces diagnostically sufficient perfusion maps at substantially reduced dose rates as low as 20 % of the normal scan.KEY POINTS: Perfusion-CT is an accurate tool for the detection of brain ischemias. The high associated radiation doses are a major drawback of brain perfusion CT. Decreasing tube current in perfusion CT increases image noise and deteriorates image quality. Combination of different image-denoising techniques produces sufficient image quality from ultra-low-dose perfusion CT.",Excluded

The number of Abeta plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1beta, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Abeta burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task.RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Abeta plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy x 10), 72% (2 Gy x 5) and 78% (2 Gy x 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001). The reduction in Abeta burden (2 Gy x 5) was associated with cognitive improvement (p=0.012).CONCLUSION: This is the first report that a clinically relevant course of external beam irradiation (2 Gy x 5) produces a significant reduction in AD-associated amyloid-beta plaques with a subsequent improvement in cognitive function.

3603,"Comet assay as a useful tool to assess brain damage DNA damage could be defined as any modification of DNA that changes its coding properties. There are two main mechanisms inducing damage to the structure of DNA: (1) spontaneous damage caused by sources within a cell and (2) damage caused by external sources such as chemicals and radiation. Protracted oxidative, hydrolytic, deamination or alkylation reactions can modify DNA bases, or even sometimes cause a complete loss of bases within DNA, resulting in strand breakage. In the same way, cellular DNA can be damaged by external sources such as ultraviolet or ionizing radiation and a variety of chemical substances can induce interstrand and intrastrand cross-links, DNA-protein cross-links, bulky DNA adducts, single strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs). The human genome is constantly exposed to many classes of genotoxins and the central nervous system is sensitive to oxidative damage. Deficiency in repair of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. DNA damage measurement in any cell or tissue is a significant indicator of a stable or unstable nature of the genomic apparatus, which would reveal physiological health status of a single cell and a whole organism. A number of techniques to detect DNA damage have been used to identify substances with genotoxic activity. The most useful approach to assess DNA damage seems to be the single-cell gel (SCG) or also named Comet assay. This is a simple, rapid, and sensitive technique for the analysis of DNA damage in all cell types, which combine DNA gel electrophoresis with fluorescence microscopy to visualize the migration of DNA strands from individual agarose-embedded cells. Determination of the relative amount of DNA that migrates provided an easy way to evaluate the number of DNA breaks in an individual cell. Since its development in 1984, the Comet assay has been modified at various steps to make it suitable for assessing various kinds of damage in different cells. It is now a tool used extensively to assess DNA damage and repair. Since the introduction of the Alkaline Comet assay, in 1988, the extent of applications and the number of investigators using this technique have increased almost exponentially. This assay has developed into a vital tool for use by investigators interested in research areas ranging from human and environmental biomonitoring to DNA repair processes and genetic toxicology. The Comet assay has been used as a test to predict the risk of development of some diseases related to a higher susceptibility of the individual to DNA damage.

2852,"Feasibility and clinical tolerability of the extendTM relocatable head frame for perfexionTM intra-cranial stereotactic radiotherapy Purpose: This study aims to identify the challenges in clinical use of the EXTENDTM relocatable head frame (RHF) and to qualitatively report the patient's experience. Materials/Methods: Patients and volunteers enrolled on two prospective clinical trials were fitted, positioned, and immobilized using the RHF. The RHF includes a patient-specific detachable front mouthpiece for dental and hard palate impression. A vacuum is applied to ensure tensionless fixation without the need for active patient cooperation. For positioning, a 1mm action threshold was used. To capture the tolerability of the RHF, subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire immediately after initial fitting, CT simulation, and at the end of their treatment. The questions addressed overall impression and discomfort during the various stages of the procedure. Result(s): Six volunteers completed study procedures without difficulty. Of 21 patients enrolled, one patient was aborted due to geometric constraints of the RHF colliding with his skull, and one patient withdrew from study participation. For the four patients treated on Perfexion the mean difference between CT and PFX position was less than 1mm.Patient anatomy including a high palate, short neck, and broad shoulders were identified as challenges to clinical use of the RHF. Gagging during fitting occurred in six patients and with one patient during positioning. Qualitative review of questionnaires revealed 5 themes: (1) patients have an overall positive impression of the process; (2) most find the dental imprint procedure distressing; (3) positioning was fairly tolerated; (4) overall discomfort during the time of immobilization is none to mild in the hard palate; (5) discomfort to the neck, shoulders and back is mild. Conclusion(s): The study result highlights challenges related to the dental impression procedure, and the importance of a careful patient selection. From the patients perspective the procedure is fairly well tolerated, and may improve by addressing discomforts during the fitting procedure. Positioning within a sub-millimeter accuracy threshold is achievable.",Excluded
2822,"Paralysis following stereotactic spinal irradiation in pigs suggests a tolerance constraint for single-session irradiation of the spinal nerve BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Paralysis observed during a study of vertebral bone tolerance to single-session irradiation led to further study of the dose-related incidence of motor peripheral neuropathy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a bone tolerance study, cervical spinal nerves of 15 minipigs received bilateral irradiation to levels C5-C8 distributed into three dose groups with mean maximum spinal nerve doses of 16.9 +/- 0.3 Gy (n=5), 18.7 +/- 0.5 Gy (n=5), and 24.3 +/- 0.8 Gy (n=5). Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal. Irradiated spinal nerve regions showed increased thickness and hypointensity on MR imaging.CONCLUSION: The single-session tolerance dose of the cervical spinal nerves lies between 19.0 and 24.1 Gy for this model.",Included

2587,"Identification of tumor precursor cells in the brains of primates with radiation-induced de novo glioblastoma multiforme The pathogenesis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is poorly understood and precursor cells are not known. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development. The findings provide insight into the tumorigenesis of de novo GBMs and suggest a new strategy for treatment of these lethal tumors by targeting both inactivation of N-CoR and inhibition of EGFR.",Included

2837,"Formulation optimization of smart thermosetting lamotrigine loaded hydrogels using response surface methodology, box benhken design and artificial neural networks The aim of this research was to develop lamotrigine containing thermosetting hydrogel for intranasal administration to manage and treat generalized epilepsy. Thermosetting hydrogels were prepared using different ratios of poloxamer 407 (L127), poloxamer 188 (L68) and Carbopol<sup></sup> 974 P NF (C974) using the cold production process. The in situ thermosetting hydrogel was optimized using Box Behken design. Co-solvency approach was used to increase the solubility of lamotrigine by dissolving it in propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol 400 (0.2: 0.8) and the resultant solution was incorporated in the hydrogel to manufacture an LTG hydrogel. The presence of a higher amount of L127 resulted in higher viscosity at 22 degreeC and 34 degreeC and decreased the overall release of LTG. An increase in the amount of C974 resulted in a decrease in the pH of the hydrogel. The results show that formulations F10, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16 and F17 exhibited acceptable thermosetting behavior, pH and released adequate Lamotrigine above the minimum effective concentration to treat generalized epilepsy. The optimized formulation exhibited acceptable thermosetting behavior, pH and lamotrigine release but formed a stiff gel at 22 degreeC. The average LTG content of the optimized hydrogel was 5.00 +/- 0.0225 mg/ml with % recovery of 99.17%. The amount of LTG released at 12 h from the optimized hydrogel was 3.21 +/- 0.0155 mg and will be therapeutically effective in the brain after absorption via the olfactory region in the nasal cavity.

Fraction dose (fd) varied from 2 to 15 Gy (123 fractionated and 14 radiosurgical treatments), and total dose (TD) from 8 to 30 Gy (111 cases irradiated with fd of 2 GY to TD of 24 Gy). We evaluated pain relief, changes in analgesic requirements, and reossification.RESULTS: Means of pain relief 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after radiotherapy (defined as a decrease of primary pain level expressed in percent) were 60.5%, 65.4%, 68.3%, and 78.4%, respectively. Proportion of patients with no need for analgesics and patients using tramadol were 39%, 40%, 44%, 57%, and 20%, 17%, 22%, and 11% in these times. The proportion of patients experiencing complete/partial pain relief changed from 36/48% 1 month, to 64/22% 1.5 years after radiotherapy. No impact of radiotherapy on reossification was found. The positive impact of fd and TD increase for analgesics uptake reduction and pain relief was found. An increase of the fd by 1 Gy results in 27% chance of analgesics uptake reduction and 3.8% reduction of pain, whereas 14% analgesics uptake reduction and 2.2% of pain reduction in case of the TD. The predictive factors improving results were found: female gender, older age, better performance states (the chance of the lower analgesic treatment decreases over 2.5 times in comparison to the higher Zubrod degree), bigger Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data support the efficacy of radiotherapy in improving pain secondary to vertebral hemangioma, with the degree of pain amelioration being related to increasing fd and TD.

3088,"Prostate cancer: Focal tumour ablation or total gland ablation? Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers affecting the male population worldwide. Men with newly diagnosed cancer have to decide between many available treatments. In particular, patients with low-risk PC (stage T1-T2, Nx-N0, M0) can now approach a focal therapy to avoid side effects of ""whole-gland treatment,"" such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or damage to surrounding structures. The key points for focal therapy depend on valid identification of target lesions within the prostate gland, long-term efficacy of treatment, and appropriate patient follow-up. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is now available as a focal therapeutic option for the management of low-risk PC; in the last 10 years, its feasibility and safety has been tested in a growing number of clinical studies. At present, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most accurate techniques used to investigate the male pelvis; recently, MR guidance was combined with the HIFU principle and was presented as a novel technique for focal ablation of PC. MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) represents a potential treatment of choice owing to its high anatomical resolution and the possibility of real-time monitoring of temperature during ablation. MRgFUS can also be used as a salvation therapy for locally proven recurrence of PC after radiation or brachytherapy failures.

3530,"Monomeric Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase is a common misfolding intermediate in the oxidation models of sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Proteinacious intracellular aggregates in motor neurons are a key feature of both sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These inclusion bodies are often immunoreactive for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and are implicated in the pathology of ALS. On the basis of this and a similar clinical presentation of symptoms in the familial (fALS) and sporadic forms of ALS, we sought to investigate the possibility that there exists a common disease-related aggregation pathway for fALS-associated mutant SODs and wild type SOD1. We have previously shown that oxidation of fALS-associated mutant SODs produces aggregates that have the same morphological, structural, and tinctorial features as those found in SOD1 inclusion bodies in ALS. Here, we show that oxidative damage of wild type SOD at physiological concentrations ( approximately 40 microm) results in destabilization and aggregation in vitro. Oxidation of either mutant or wild type SOD1 causes the enzyme to dissociate to monomers prior to aggregation. Only small changes in secondary and tertiary structure are associated with monomer formation.

Here, we present event-related brain potentials (ERPs) obtained from sixteen healthy individuals while they discriminated complex instrumental tones (piano, trumpet, and violin) or simple sine wave tones that lack the principal features of timbre. Data analysis yielded enhanced N1 and P2 responses to instrumental tones relative to sine wave tones. Furthermore, we applied an electrical brain imaging approach using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to estimate the neural sources of N1/P2 responses. Separate significance tests of instrumental vs. sine wave tones for N1 and P2 revealed distinct regions as principally governing timbre perception. In an initial stage (N1), timbre perception recruits left and right (peri-)auditory fields with an activity maximum over the right posterior Sylvian fissure (SF) and the posterior cingulate (PCC) territory. In the subsequent stage (P2), we uncovered enhanced activity in the vicinity of the entire cingulate gyrus. The involvement of extra-auditory areas in timbre perception may imply the presence of a highly associative processing level which might be generally related to musical sensations and integrates widespread medial areas of the human cortex. In summary, our results demonstrate spatio-temporally distinct stages in timbre perception which not only involve bilateral parts of the peri-auditory cortex but also medially situated regions of the human brain associated with emotional and auditory imagery functions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Case Description: A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery. Conclusion(s): Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches.

Continuous intrathecal infusion of bFGF (44 rats) or saline (24 rats) into the cisterna magna was given concomitantly. A further experiment included 14 additional rats which were treated with subcutaneous injection of IGF-1 parallel to irradiation with a total dose of 34 Gy or 36 Gy. 20 rats received combined treatment, i.e. intrathecal infusion of bFGF plus subcutaneous injection of IGF-1, starting 24 hours before irradiation (total dose 33 Gy or 36 Gy) for a total of 4 days. Animals were followed until myelopathy developed or for a maximum of 12 months. Histopathologic examinations were performed post mortem.RESULTS: Treatment with bFGF alone or IGF-1 alone increased the median time to myelopathy significantly. In the 36-Gy group, after combination treatment a comparable prolongation of latency was seen. Moreover, rats treated with 33 Gy and combined bFGF plus IGF-1 showed a significantly reduced risk of myelopathy, too (p = 0.0015, Figures 1 and 2).CONCLUSION: Combination of IGF-1 and bFGF was more potent than single agent treatment. We observed a significantly reduced myelopathy rate at an intermediate radiation dose level and a longer time to myelopathy at a high-dose level. This finding strengthens the evidence that brief therapeutic intervention can decrease radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies will be undertaken to optimize this strategy.",Excluded
2756,"A randomized phase III trial of cisplatin and tumor volume directed irradiation followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel vs. carboplatin and paclitaxel for optimally debulked, advanced endometrial carcinoma Background: Patients with stage III/IVA uterine cancer (UC) carry high risk of systemic and local recurrence. Chemotherapy was shown to reduce systemic recurrence, however the risk of local failure remains high. Method(s): The primary endpoint of this open label, randomized phase III trial was to determine if treatment with cisplatin and volume-directed radiation followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles (C-RT, experimental arm) reduces the rate of recurrence or death (i.e., increases recurrence-free survival, RFS) when compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 cycles (CT, control arm) in patients with stages III-IVA (<2 cm residual disease) or FIGO 2009 stage I/II serous or clear cell UC and positive cytology. Secondary objectives were assessment of overall survival (OS), acute and late toxicities, and quality of life. A 28.5% reduction in the rate of recurrence or death was considered significant. Treatment randomization and analysis were stratified by gross residual tumor and age. Result(s): Between 6/2009 and 7/2014, 813 patients were enrolled and randomized (407 C-RT and 406-CT). Of those, 733 were eligible (344 C-RT and 360 CT), and 680 received the trial intervention (333 C-RT and 347 CT). Median follow up is 47 months. Patients characteristics were balanced between arms. There were 201 (58%) > grd 3 toxicity events in the C-RT arm and 227 (63%) in the CT arm. The most common > grd 3 events were myelosupression (40% vs. 52%), gastrointestinal (13% vs. 4%), metabolic (15% vs. 19%), neurological (7% vs. 6%), infectious (4% vs. 5%). Treatment hazard ratio for RFS was 0.9 (C-RT vs. CT; CI 0.74 to 1.10). C-RT reduced the incidence of vaginal (3% vs. 7%, HR = 0.36, CI 0.16 to 0.82), pelvic and paraaortic recurrences (10% vs. 21%, HR=0.43, CI 02.8 to 0.66) compared to CT, but distant recurrences were more common with C-RT vs. CT (28% vs. 21%, HR 1.36, CI 1 to 1.86). The analysis is premature for OS comparison. Conclusion(s): Although C-RT reduced the rate of local recurrence compared to CT; the combined modality regimen did not increase RFS in optimally debulked, stage III/IVA UC.",Excluded
3599,"Unusual Physiological Properties of Smooth Monostratified Ganglion Cell Types in Primate Retina The functions of the diverse retinal ganglion cell types in primates and the parallel visual pathways they initiate remain poorly understood. Here, unusual physiological and computational properties of the ON and OFF smooth monostratified ganglion cells are explored. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings from 48 macaque retinas revealed that these cells exhibit irregular receptive field structure composed of spatially segregated hotspots, quite different from the classic center-surround model of retinal receptive fields. Surprisingly, visual stimulation of different hotspots in the same cell produced spikes with subtly different spatiotemporal voltage signatures, consistent with a dendritic contribution to hotspot structure. Targeted visual stimulation and computational inference demonstrated strong nonlinear subunit properties associated with each hotspot, supporting a model in which the hotspots apply nonlinearities at a larger spatial scale than bipolar cells. These findings reveal a previously unreported nonlinear mechanism in the output of the primate retina that contributes to signaling spatial information.",Excluded
2959,"Inactivation and block of calcium channels by photo-released Ca2+ in dorsal root ganglion neurons Calcium channels are inactivated by voltage and intracellular calcium. To study the kinetics and the mechanism of calcium-induced inactivation of calcium channels, a ""caged"" calcium compound, dimethoxy-nitrophen was used to photo-release about 50 microM calcium ion within 0.2 millisecond in dorsal root ganglion neurons. When divalent cations were the charge carriers, intracellular photo-release of calcium inactivated the calcium channel with an invariant rate [time constant (tau) approximately equal to 7 milliseconds]. When the monovalent cation sodium was the charge carrier, photorelease of calcium inside or outside of the cell blocked the channel rapidly (tau approximately equal to 0.4 millisecond), but the block was greater from the external side. Thus the kinetics of calcium-induced calcium channel inactivation depends on the valency of the permeant cation. The data imply that calcium channels exist in either of two conformational states, the calcium- and sodium-permeant forms, or, alternatively, calcium-induced inactivation occurs at a site closely associated with the internal permeating site.",Excluded
3070,"Morphological and functional identifications of catfish retinal neurons. I. Classical morphology The morphology of the catfish horizontal cells is comparable to that in other fish retinas. The external horizontal cells contact cone receptors and are stellate in shape; the intermediate horizontal cells are even more so and contact rod receptors. The internal horizontal cells constitute the most proximal layer of the inner nuclear layer and may possibly be, in reality, extended processes from the other two horizontal cell types. Bipolar cells resemble those in other teleost retinas: the size and shape of their dendritic tree encompass a continuous spectrum ranging from what is known as the small to the large bipolar cells. The accepted definition of amacrine cells is sufficiently vague to justify our originating a more descriptive and less inferential name for the (axonless) neurons in the inner nuclear layer which radiate processes throughout the inner synaptic layer. These starbust and spaghetti cells vary considerably in the character and extent of their dendritic spread, but correlates exist in other vertebrate retinas. Ganglion cells are found not only in the classical ganglion layer but displaced into the inner nuclear layer as well. Several types can be distinguished on the basis of cell geometry and by the properties of their dendritic tree. Not all of the categorization corresponds with previous descriptions; our findings suggest that some reorganization may be necessary in the accepted classification of cells in the proximal areas of the vertebrate retina. A subtle yet remarkable pattern underlies the entire structure of the catfish retina; there exists a definite gradient of size within a particular class of cells, and of configuration among the subclasses of a specific cell type. It remains to be seen if these morphological spectra bear any functional consequences. The fact that the structure of the catfish retina most closely resembles those of other phylogenetically ancient animals, such as the skate and the dogfish shark, testifies to its primitive organization; morphological and functional mechanisms discernible in this simple system may, therefore, be applicable to the retinas of higher ordered vertebrates.",Excluded

From 1970 to 1985, 33 orbital localizations in 30 patients were treated. The total dose applied ranged from 21 to 57 Gy (2 Gy per fraction), two-thirds of all patients received a dose of 40 Gy. The complete-response rate was 94% and the 10 years actuarial survival was 90%; no significant difference in survival was observed between patients with low grade or intermediate grade lymphoma. No local recurrence was detected during follow up and 20% of the patients developed generalized disease. Two optic nerve neuropathies and three retinopathies were observed in five patients, four of these occurred at a dose level of less than 43 Gy. Keratitis occurred in 58% of the patients treated, a sicca syndrome in 30% and cataract of different grades in 58% of the patients treated. Although local control was excellent, severe complications were observed in 13% of the patients who received a dose of less than 43 Gy. [References: 35]",Excluded
3467,"Predictive biomarkers for improving radiation therapy Radiotherapy is an important treatment modality for millions of patients with cancer worldwide. Current treatment decisions do not take into account individual patients' or cohorts of patients' sensitivities to this treatment modality. As such, patients treated with radiation therapy experience a large variation in normal tissue toxicity that results in doselimiting acute and irreversible progressive side effects. Important examples of these adverse effects include mucositis, pneumonitis, and cognitive damage, respectively representing acute, intermediate, and late effects. Stratification of patients based on radiation sensitivities will allow delivery of suitable alternative treatments to high-risk patients and dose escalation to tumors in less sensitive patients. Current focus on radiation biomarkers/biodosimeters appears to be primarily to assess radiation doses after catastrophic accidental radiation exposure. Recent advances have brought together several cross-disciplinary areas such as biological assays, analytical platforms, and algorithms to rapidly assess dose to individuals. These technologies are at different maturation levels. This immense progress is also an opportunity to use them to predict heterogeneity of radiation sensitivities among cancer patients to improve radiation therapy outcome and their quality of life. This talk will emphasize the need for discovery, development, and validation of predictive biomarkers, provide some examples of biomarkers, and discuss the translational challenges involved in leveraging advances in radiation-specific biomarker research to radiotherapy, which for the foreseeable future likely to remain a cornerstone of cancer treatment.",Excluded
3591,"Octopamine modulates photoreceptor function in the Limulus lateral eye Activity at night in efferent nerve fibers from a central circadian clock produces changes in photoreceptor function in the lateral compound eye of Limulus: the response to light is increased; membrane potential fluctuations (bumps) occurring in the dark are suppressed; and the duration of bumps occurring both in the dark and under dim illumination is increased (Barlow et al., 1977; Kaplan & Barlow, 1980; Barlow, 1983; Barlow et al., 1985). Efferent nerve terminals release octopamine when activated (Battelle et al., 1982; Battelle & Evans, 1984, 1986); exogenous octopamine in vitro produces some of the changes resulting from efferent nerve activity in vivo (Kass et al., 1988). We report here that the increase in both on-transient and steady-state response to light induced by octopamine in the lateral eye in vitro are concentration dependent with threshold at or below 100 nM, saturation at or above 100 microM, and half-maximal increase in the range 1-10 microM. Octopamine also reduces bump activity in the dark in a concentration-dependent way. Unlike the increase in light response, the dependence of this effect on octopamine concentration is extremely variable from specimen to specimen. The effects of exogenous octopamine on light response and bump activity can sometimes be reversed by removing octopamine from the medium bathing the in vitro preparation. Octopamine also increases bump duration, apparently in a concentration-dependent manner. We have not succeeded in reversing this increase in bump duration. The concentration dependence of changes in photoreceptor response described here agrees qualitatively with the dependence of cAMP levels on octopamine in Limulus photoreceptors (Kaupp et al., 1982), lending further support to the idea that cAMP acts as a second messenger in the circadian control of photoreceptor function. Our results also suggest that the changes induced in the transient and steady-state response to light by both efferent nerve activity and exogenous octopamine have a common origin, which may differ from that responsible for the modulation of bump activity.",Excluded
3116,"A rhodopsin in the brain functions in circadian photoentrainment in Drosophila Animals partition their daily activity rhythms through their internal circadian clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating day-night cycles of light. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses day-night cycles in part through rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only to high levels of light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh7 functions in circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in the central brain.",Excluded
3611,"Thalamic energy dysregulation drives microstructural changes of thalamocortical projections in multiple sclerosis Background and aims: Neuronal energy dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed as a key driver of axonal degeneration. Diffusion-weighted 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) can measure the diffusivity of creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr/PhCr), whose reduction in the MS thalamus has been proposed to reflect limited energy reserves. We tested in-vivo whether thalamic energy dysregulation is associated with microstructural degeneration of its projection tracts in MS. Method(s): Seventeen patients and thirteen healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3T MRI scan including DW-MRS and DW sequences. From DW-MRS, Cr apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(tCr)) was extracted in the bilateral thalami. Thalamic projections to somatosensory, dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes and optic radiations (case tracts) and the arcuate (non-thalamic control tract) were manually drawn in TrackVis (Fig.1). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), reflecting microstructural damage, were extracted for each tract. Associations between ADC(tCr) and microstructural parameters were tested using linear mixed-effect models. (Figure presented) Results: In MS, lower thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with lower mean FA and higher mean MD of pooled thalamo-cortical tracts after adjusting for disease duration, gender and tract-specific lesion load (p=0.033 and p=0.047). No correlation was found in HCs. Unadjusted tract-by-tract analysis confirmed the correlation between thalamic ADC(tCr) and MD in patients. The arcuate tract, not connected to the thalamus, showed no correlation (Fig.2). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with specific microstructural damage of thalamo-cortical tracts in MS, suggesting that energy dysfunction in this crucial hub - through an impaired Cr/PhCr transport/utilization - may disrupt thalamo-cortical networks by inducing the selective anterograde degeneration of connected fibers.",Excluded

The authors compared results using two major GKS target points, the dorsal root entry zone and the retrogasserian portion, in a series of patients with intractable TN.METHODS: One hundred patients with medically refractory TN underwent GKS between August 1998 and December 2007. Thirty-seven were men, and 63 were women. The median age at GKS was 74 years. With a single isocenter and use of a 4mm collimator, 51 patients received 80 Gy at the proximal trigeminal nerve (posterior group) and 7 patients received 80 Gy, 1 patient received 85 Gy, and 41 patients received 90 Gy at the retrogasserian portion (anterior group). Follow-up was obtained by clinic visits every 3-6 months after GKS. Data on pain control, complications, and pain recurrence were recorded. The relationships between pain control status, complications, recurrence, and the target portions (anterior vs posterior) were analyzed.RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 3-88 months). Initially, 87 patients achieved pain-free status and 64 achieved complete remission. At the final follow-up visit, 68 patients were still in pain-free status and 42 were in complete remission. Recurrence of facial pain occurred in 15 patients. Forty-one patients developed some degree of trigeminal dysfunction. The rate of initial complete remission was higher in the posterior group than in the anterior group (p = 0.003). More complications were observed in the anterior group than in the posterior group (p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: The posterior targeting group had better pain control and a lower complication rate. The authors recommend the posterior targeting method and use of 80 Gy for treatment of TN with GKS.",Excluded
3472,"Targeted sequencing and intracranial outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinoma brain metastases treated with radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma (AC) has become increasingly personalized based on molecular results. However, for patients with AC brain metastases (BMs), intracranial outcomes based on molecular subtype and the frequency of molecular aberrations are less well defined. This study sought to report targeted next-generation sequencing results and investigate molecularly based outcomes for patients with AC-BMs treated with radiotherapy.METHODS: The records of 132 patients with AC-BMs treated at Emory University from September 2008 to August 2016 with successful next-generation sequencing were reviewed. Rates of local disease recurrence, distant brain failure (DBF), and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were estimated using cumulative incidence with competing risk analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.RESULTS: The most common aberrations included tumor protein 53 (TP53) (60%), KRAS (29%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (20.5%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss (15.5%), and MET amplification (13%). The majority of patients (62%) were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery alone. In these patients, KRAS mutation, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, and having >= 6 BMs were associated with an increased risk of salvage WBRT (P < .05). KRAS mutation remained significant for an increased risk of salvage WBRT when compared with EGFR/ALK/KRAS-negative patients (hazard ratio, 5.17; P < .05), despite a similar risk of DBF. PTEN loss was associated with increased risk of DBF (P < .05), whereas EGFR and ALK aberrations were associated with a decreased risk of local disease recurrence (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study quantified the frequency of genetic aberrations in patients with AC-BMs and demonstrated their association with intracranial outcomes. In particular, a cohort of patients with KRAS mutations and >=6 BMs were identified to be at high risk of requiring salvage WBRT after undergoing upfront stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded

Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), forward mutation frequencies at the ad-3 loci, and mutation spectra at the ad-3B gene were determined.RESULTS: The canonical NHEJ (cNHEJ)-deficient strain showed resistance to higher X-ray doses, while other strains showed dose-dependent sensitivity. In contrast, the killing effects of Ar-ion and Fe-ion beam irradiation were dose-dependent in all strains tested. The rank order of RBE was Ar-ion > Fe-ion > C-ion. Deletion mutations were the most common, but deletion size incremented with the increasing value of linear energy transfer (LET).CONCLUSIONS: We found marked differences in killing effect of a cNHEJ-deficient mutant between X-ray and high-LET ion beam irradiations (Ar and Fe). The mutation spectra also differed between irradiation types. These differences may be due to the physical properties of each radiation and the repair mechanism of induced damage in Neurospora crassa. These results may guide the choice of irradiation beam to kill or mutagenize fungi for agricultural applications or further research.",Excluded
2532,"Delayed occurrence of ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) 5 years after the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine carcinoma Background: Ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) in patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is characterized by increased mortality, however early detection and treatment of EAS may improve survival. In rare cases, EAS can arise >3 months after NEC diagnosis (metachronously). Elevations in plasma levels of the ACTH precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and/or agouti-related peptide (AgRP) have been associated with EAS. Clinical Case: A 61-year-old woman with a 5-year history of a poorly-differentiated lung neuroendocrine carcinoma with widely-disseminated metastases, treated with chemotherapy and radiation, was admitted for new-onset hypokalemia, 2 weeks after the initiation of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for lower extremity edema. Despite discontinuation of HCTZ, hypokalemia persisted and 120-200 meq of potassium chloride daily were required to maintain normal potassium levels. Proximal muscle weakness and hyperglycemia were noted. Morning cortisol and ACTH levels were 48 mcg/dL (nl 4.8-19.5mcg/dL) and 141pg/mL (nl 6-58 pg/mL) respectively, compared to a morning cortisol and ACTH of 9.3mcg/dL and 19pg/mL 5 years prior, at the time of NEC diagnosis. Serum cortisol was 61mcg/dL after an overnight 1mg dexamethasone suppression test and urinary free cortisol was 7544mcg/24h (nl<45mcg/24h), confirming the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma POMC and AgRP were measured and were 80 fmol/mL (nl <45 fmol/mL) and 884 pg/mL (nl<280 pg/mL), respectively, supporting a diagnosis of EAS. Potassium levels normalized following spironolactone treatment. Metyrapone therapy was initiated, but hypercortisolism persisted and the patient succumbed to multifocal pneumonia 4 weeks after presentation. Postmortem examination showed an absence of ACTH immunoreactivity in metastatic tumor tissue obtained at the time of diagnosis of NEC, as well as in the tissues biopsied 3 years later (subcarinal lymph node, liver). However, sites of tumor metastases (subcutaneous shoulder mass, ovary) sampled 4 or more years after NEC diagnosis showed focal staining for ACTH, consistent with EAS arising years after the development of NEC. Conclusion(s): This case highlights the rare occurrence of ectopic metachronous ACTH secretion occurring in a NEC. The observed elevations in plasma POMC likely reflect aberrant tumoral processing of POMC to ACTH. While glucocorticoids may modulate the synthesis and release of AgRP, the magnitude of the elevation in plasma AgRP in this case supports the possibility of a concomitant tumoral AgRP source. The elevations in plasma POMC and AgRP in EAS associated with NEC in this case underscore the potential utility of these neuropeptides as tumor markers that could improve clinical monitoring for EAS and facilitate more timely interventions to optimize survival.",Excluded

Light-induced release of progonadal hormones involves a complex cascade of responses both inside and outside the brain. In this study, we used induction of early growth response 1 (Egr-1), the protein product of an immediate early gene, to evaluate the time course of such responses in male white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) exposed to a single long day. Induction of Egr-1 in the pars tuberalis began ~11h after dawn. This response was followed ~6h later by dramatic induction in the tuberal hypothalamus, including in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. At approximately the same time, Egr-1 was induced in dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus and in dopaminergic neurons of the premammillary nucleus. We noted no induction in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons until 2h after dawn the following morning. Overall, our results indicate that Egr-1 responses in GnRH neurons occur rather late during photostimulation, compared with responses in other cell populations, and that such induction may reflect new synthesis related to GnRH depletion rather than stimulation by light cues.",Excluded
2649,"Radiation in the management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors Background: Radiation therapy (RT) has not historically been incorporated into multidisciplinary management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs). We provide a two-institution series of patients with PNTs who were treated with external beam RT either neoadjuvantly to attempt down-staging for surgery, or in the setting of post-surgical recurrence. Our objective was to assess treatment response and outcomes in this cohort of patients. Method(s): We identified eleven patients with a pathologic diagnosis of PNT from 2006-2011 who received external beam RT to the primary tumor or resection bed. Each institution's electronic medical record was used to evaluate patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment regimens and tolerance, radiographic response, and survival. Result(s): Our series consists of eleven patients (6 men, 5 women) with a mean age of 57 years (range 37-72 years). All had biopsy proven PNT and were clinically T3 (n=3) or T4 (n=8), M0. Five patients were clinically node positive. All patients received RT to the primary tumor or resection bed to a median dose of 50.4 Gy. Seven patients received concurrent chemotherapy with capecitabine at a median dose of 1000mg/m<sup>2</sup> bid. Nine patients were treated definitively for locally advanced disease, two of whom subsequently underwent surgical resection. Two patients were treated to palliate post-resection recurrence. Initial radiographic response to RT included 2 complete responses (CR), 2 partial responses (PR), 4 stable disease, 3 progressive disease (PD). Two patients were classified as PD due to the development of distant metastases less than 2 months after completing RT. Two grade 3 toxicities were documented (one early, one late). At a median follow-up of 30.4 months, three patients had died with evidence of PD, two had died without evidence of PD, three were alive with metastases, and three were alive without evidence of disease progression (1 stable, 1 PR, 1 CR). From the start of RT, median overall survival was 32.1 months; progression free survival was 14.6 months. Conclusion(s): RT may have the potential to convert PNTs from locally-advanced to resectable. RT may also increase local control of PNTs. Consideration should be given to the use of RT in prospective trials of PNT treatment.",Excluded

Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice. In addition, radiation induced augmentation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and a decline in the total antioxidant capacity in serum; these changes were also ameliorated by melatonin pretreatment.

3254,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals abnormal plastic response to premotor cortex stimulation in schizophrenia BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia may be characterized by abnormal plastic modulation in cortical neuronal circuits. Activation of premotor cortex using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) produces suppression of cortical excitability in primary motor cortex. We hypothesized that premotor rTMS would cause less suppression of motor cortical excitability in patients with schizophrenia than in control subjects.METHODS: Twelve patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and twelve healthy control subjects underwent subthreshold rTMS to the premotor area in a 15-min conditioning train. Measurements of primary motor cortical excitability (motor evoked potential; MEP), the resting motor threshold (RMT), and cortical inhibition (CI) were taken before and after the rTMS.RESULTS: There was no difference in RMT between groups at baseline, although the patient group had less CI than the control group at baseline. Following rTMS, the change in both MEP size and RMT between groups was significant. After rTMS, MEP size was suppressed in the control group and increased in the patient group, whereas RMT increased in the normal control group and decreased in the patient group.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal brain responses to rTMS applied to the premotor cortex that appear to relate to reduced motor cortical inhibition.",Excluded

3397,"Treatment of near-skull brain tissue with a focused device using shear-mode conversion: a numerical study Shear mode transmission through the skull has been previously proposed as a new trans-skull propagation technique for noninvasive therapeutic ultrasound (Clement 2004 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD).

3118,"DASL-HiCaP: Darolutamide augments standard therapy for localized very high-risk cancer of the prostate (ANZUP1801)-A randomized phase III doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of adding darolutamide to androgen deprivation therapy and definitive or salvage radiation Background: Radiation therapy (RT), plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHA), is standard of care for men with very high-risk localized prostate cancer (PC), or with very high- risk features and persistent PSA after radical prostatectomy (RP). Despite this, incurable distant metastases develop within 5 years in 15% of men with very high-risk features. Darolutamide is a structurally distinct oral androgen receptor antagonist with low blood-brain-barrier penetration, a demonstrated favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of adding darolutamide to ADT and RT in the setting of either primary definitive therapy, or adjuvant therapy for very high-risk PC. Method(s): This study is a randomized (1:1) phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for men planned for RT who have very high-risk localized PC; or very high-risk features with PSA persistence or rise within one year following RP. The trial will be stratified by: RP; use of adjuvant docetaxel; pelvic nodal involvement. 1100 participants will be randomized to darolutamide 600 mg or placebo twice daily for 96 weeks. Participants will receive LHRHA for 96 weeks, plus RT starting week 8-24 from randomisation. Participants are allowed nonsteroidal antiandrogen (up to 90 days) in addition to LHRHA up until randomisation. Early treatment with up to 6 cycles of docetaxel completed at least 4 weeks prior to RT is permitted. The primary endpoint is metastasis-free survival (ICECaP-validated), with secondary endpoints overall survival, PC-specific survival, PSA-progression free survival, time to subsequent hormonal therapy, time to castrationresistance, frequency and severity of adverse events, health related quality of life, fear of recurrence. Tertiary endpoints include incremental cost-effectiveness, and identification of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of treatment response, safety and resistance to study treatment.",Excluded
3290,"Caries clinical trial of a remineralising toothpaste in radiation patients OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of a specially formulated remineralising toothpaste in controlling caries in a high-risk population: head and neck radiation patients.DESIGN: The study compared the performance of the remineralising toothpaste with a conventional fluoride dentifrice using double-blind randomisation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test products: The products compared contained equivalent quantities of fluoride (1100 p.p.m.). The dual-phase remineralising toothpaste, Enamelon, also delivered soluble calcium and phosphate ions, essential components of teeth, from separate phases. Both groups had all caries restored at baseline and used a fluoride rinse daily.SUBJECTS: Fifty-seven subjects who received radiation to the head and neck causing saliva hypofunction, entered the study, while 44 completed the 10-12 month visit.MEASUREMENTS: Examinations included coronal and root caries using the Pitts Diagnostic Criteria, salivary flow rate, plaque and gingival indices and microbiological counts over a 1-year period.RESULTS: The average net increment per year for root caries per subject was 0.04 (+/-.052) in subjects completing the study using the remineralising toothpaste and 1.65 (+/-0.51) for root caries in subjects completing the study using the conventional fluoride dentifrice. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.03), suggesting lower net root surface increment/year for the remineralising toothpaste relative to the conventional toothpaste. No significant differences were noted on coronal surfaces.CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the remineralising toothpaste provides a significant benefit in preventing and remineralising root caries in high-risk patients.",Excluded

Consolidation cytarabine was given after the radiotherapy. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving rdWBRT. Exploratory end points included prospective neuropsychological evaluation, analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter changes using the Fazekas scale, and evaluation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a prognostic factor.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with median age of 60 years (range, 30 to 79 years) and median Karnofsky performance score of 70 (range, 50 to 100). Thirty-one patients (60%) achieved a CR after R-MPV and received rdWBRT. The 2-year PFS for this group was 77%; median PFS was 7.7 years. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached (median follow-up for survivors, 5.9 years); 3-year OS was 87%. The overall (N = 52) median PFS was 3.3 years, and median OS was 6.6 years. Cognitive assessment showed improvement in executive function (P < .01) and verbal memory (P < .05) after chemotherapy, and follow-up scores remained relatively stable across the various domains (n = 12). All examined MRIs (n = 28) displayed a Fazekas score of <= 3, and no patient developed scores of 4 to 5; differences in ADC values did not predict response (P = .15), PFS (P = .27), or OS (P = .33).CONCLUSION: R-MPV combined with consolidation rdWBRT and cytarabine is associated with high response rates, long-term disease control, and minimal neurotoxicity.",Excluded

Rod outer segments were on average 66.4 +/- 11.2 microm (mean +/- S.D., n = 104) in length and 6.6 +/- 0.9 microm (mean +/- S.D.) in diameter: 40 +/- 22 photoisomerizations (mean +/- S.D., range 10-99, n = 16) were required for eliciting a half-saturating photocurrent response. The time-to-peak was 911 +/- 217 ms (mean +/- S.D., n = 14, 20 degrees C) in the linear range of the response and the integration time of the current response was 1744 +/- 451 ms (mean +/- S.D., n = 14). The time-to-peak appears to be slower and the integration time shorter in Caudiverbera than in Ambystoma tigrinum, Rana pipiens or Xenopus laevis rods under similar experimental conditions. The a-band of rod spectral sensitivity has a lambda(max) at 520 +/- 2.1 nm (mean +/- S.D., range 516-525 nm, n = 24) and the bandwidth fits a porphyropsin visual pigment.

However, delayed cognitive sequelae have emerged as a significant debilitating complication in PCNSL patients. A prospective observational case-series study with prospective assessments of neurocognitive functions (NCFs), neuroimaging, and activities of daily living in newly-diagnosed PCNSL patients was undertaken. A battery of neuropsychological measures, used to evaluate NCFs, is composed of ten standardized NCF tests, representing four domains sensitive to disease and treatment effects (executive function, attention, verbal memory, psychomotor speed), and activities of daily living. A total of 15 patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL were consecutively enrolled in this study. Comparing the NCF scores between the baseline (before WBRT) and post-treatment (after combined chemoradiation therapy) intervals (Mean=122.33days, SD=34.49, range = 77-196), neurobehavioral outcomes consistently remained improving or stable in almost each domain of NCF. Specifically, the scores on Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-Revised (PASAT-R) were significantly improved between the baseline and post-chemoradiation assessment.

3034,"Lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR): dosimetric considerations for chest wall toxicity OBJECTIVE: To investigate chest wall pain in patients with peripheral early stage lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and to identify factors predictive of Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events Grade 2 + chest wall pain.METHODS: Patients who received 55 Gy in five fractions were included. A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded
3391,"Rod photoreceptor dysfunction in diabetes: activation, deactivation, and dark adaptation PURPOSE: To examine photoreceptor function in diabetes in detail by evaluating photoreceptor light activation, deactivation of the photoresponse, and recovery of the photoreceptor after bleaching (dark adaptation) in rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ).METHODS: Animals were assigned to treated and control groups. Light activation in rod photoreceptors was established using a paired-flash electroretinogram (ERG) protocol, and the leading edge of the a-wave was modeled with the mechanisms mediating phototransduction. Deactivation of the photoreceptor response was evaluated at three luminous exposures (1.4-2.2 log cd.m/s-2) using a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigm. Dark adaptation was evaluated at 90-second intervals for 30 minutes after approximately 20% pigment bleach. At each time point, a paired-flash signal (1.4 log cd.s/m-2) was used to extract rod responses.RESULTS: Diabetic animals showed decreased amplitudes of the photoreceptor response 12 weeks after diabetes induction. No difference was found in the rate of deactivation of the photoresponse in diabetic rats. Normalized amplitudes showed that diabetic animals had significantly faster dark adaptation (P<0.01) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although photoreceptor activation was abnormal, deactivation was unaltered after 12 weeks of diabetes. The faster relative recovery found in diabetes after bleach, in the presence of normal pigment dynamics, may reflect a decrease in outer segment lengths.",Excluded
2801,"Effects of combined immune and radiation cancer therapy on inflammatory environment in the brain of a mouse model Purpose/Objective(s): Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These can include difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and increased anxiety. Though changes are often associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation, these effects are also seen in patients who receive peripheral but no cranial irradiation and no chemotherapy. A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance. These results will be presented at the meeting.",Included
3060,"The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum on the synkinesis of coordinated eye and head movements We made a study of coordinated saccadic eye and head movements following random and predictable horizontal visual targets by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the cerebellum before the start of the gaze movement. We have found three effects of TMS on eye/head movements under these conditions. SACCADIC LATENCY-EFFECT: When stimulation took place shortly before movements commenced, significantly shorter latencies were found between target presentation and commencement of saccades: For predictable, to a lesser extent for random targets and TMS up to 75 ms before start of the saccade, latencies were significantly decreased when compared with no application of TMS. Without stimulation, latencies to random targets were within a range of 120-200 ms. EYE-HEAD INTERACTION-EFFECT: Without TMS, for amplitudes greater than 25 degrees, head movements usually preceded eye movements, as expected, especially for predictive responses. With the application of TMS shortly after the target display, the number of eye movements which preceded head movements, was significantly increased (p<0.001), and the delay between eye and head movements was reduced or reversed (p<0.001), compared with gaze movements without the use of TMS. SACCADIC PEAK VELOCITY-EFFECT: Applying transcranial magnetic stimulation at 5-25 ms after the position change of the 60 degrees target, and 50-5 s before the start of eye movement, mean peak velocity of synkinetic saccades increased up to 600 degrees/s, compared with 350-400 degrees/s without the use of TMS. We conclude that transient functional cerebellar deficits caused by the application of TMS can change the central synkinesis of eye-head coordination.",Excluded
2914,"A study on an evaluation of brain scanning in cerebrovascular diseases. [Japanese] One hundred twenty cases of cerebrovascular diseases mainly of ischemic nature were studied. Positive brain scans were found in ischemic cerebral infarction in 68% of the cases; with a relatively low rate in the early phase from the onset of the illness showing a peak of positive scans in 2 to 4 wk with a gradual decline. Even those with a positive scan turned negative after 8 wk. A definite correlation between the clinical severity and positive scan was found. In cases with cortical involvement positive brain scan was observed in high frequency. Single brain scan yielded only a value of screening procedure but follow-up examinations in the course of illness proved to be rather important for the differential diagnosis of underlying pathology and further for fortelling the prognosis. In view of the prognosis of motor functions those with an intense uptake of radioisotope, a relatively large sized and persistent abnormality were likely left with severe neurological deficit while in cases who showed a mild and transient positive scan the recovery of motor functions were favorable. When rate of positive scan for the respective territory of cerebral vessels were evaluated, positive scans were most frequently observed in the vicinity of middle cerebral artery. The frequency of positive scans in the territory of posterior cerebral artery and vertebro-basilar artery were found lowest. Brain scanning was found most suitable for the diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, subdural hematoma and SLE vasculitis but it exhibited merely low rate of posivity in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and transient ischemic attack. This method compared to other auxillary diagnostic procedures presently available proved to be accurate with its technical simplicity. It possesses a merit of repeatability by the use of <sup>99</sup>(m)Tc as radiation exposure on each test is relatively small.

3097,"Significance of histology in determining management of lesions regrowing after radiosurgery Brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery may show delayed enlargement on post-treatment imaging that is of ambiguous etiology. Histopathologic interpretation of brain specimens is often challenging due to the presence of significant radiation effects admixed with irradiated residual tumor of indeterminate viability. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of histologic findings on clinical outcomes following resection of these lesions. Between 2004 and 2010, 690 patients with brain metastases were enrolled in a prospective gamma knife data repository, and lesions requiring excision were identified. Tissue specimens were divided into four groups based on the ratio of treatment related inflammatory changes (TRIC) to tumor cells, and subsequently patient outcomes were assessed. Of 2,583 metastases treated, 36 were excised due to symptomatic enlargement. Only TRIC, without residual evidence of tumor, was seen in 36 % (13/36) of specimens. Resection of these lesions resulted in 100 % local control in follow-up. Of the remaining 23 lesions that contained any viable-appearing tumor within the resected specimen, 8 recurred after resection. Lesions that enlarged in the first 6 months were more likely to contain higher amounts of residual tumor cells. Patients with even <2 % tumors cells on excision had significantly worse local control (75 vs. 100 %, p = 0.024) and survival (HR 0.27, p = 0.029) compared with those patients with exclusively TRIC. In summary, our findings underscore the importance of surgically obtaining tissue in a method that facilitates complete lesional interpretive histology in order to accurately guide ongoing patient management.",Excluded
2583,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included

The median age for all patients was 69 years and the median size of lesions was 1.2 cm (range 0.5-2.2 cm). The prescribed dose was a single dose of 1250 cGy for all SRS patients compared to 2500 cGy in 5 daily fractions for SRT patients. All patients had pre- and post-procedure audiometry including hearing acuity assessed using pure tone average (PTA), speech discrimination score (SDS), and speech reception threshold (SR). The results of treatment type and tumor variables resulting in hearing degradation were evaluated and compared.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 13 months (range 3-36 months), only 1 of 13 patients treated with SRS and 2 of 10 patients treated with SRT develped progression of disease. However; all patients developed deterioration in PTA, SDS, or SR on the treated side. There were no statistically significant audiometric differences between patients treated with SRT or SRS and tumor response was similar regardless of irradiation technique.CONCLUSION: Both SRS and SRT provide excellent local control rates for the treatment of acoustic neuroma. While SRS demonstrated a trend toward worsening of SDS and the treatment of lesions >1.2 cm demonstrated a trend toward worsening of PTA, neither reached statistical significance. Our data suggest that single dose irradiation using the SRS technique should be considered primarily for patient convenience. All patients treated with radiotherapy for acoustic neuromas should undergo formal hearing testing before and after treatment.",Excluded

Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner. These persistent changes in neuronal function are likely to be a consequence of the actions of ionizing radiation on the physiological processes that influence the neuronal environment.",Included

2637,"Characterization of a new rat model of experimental combined neurotrauma Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is present in two-thirds of patients with multiple injuries and in one-third combined with injuries of the extremities. Studies on interactive effects between central and peripheral injuries are scarce due to the absence of clinically relevant models. To meet the demand for ""more-hit"" models, an experimental model of combined neurotrauma (CNT) incorporating a standardized TBI via lateral fluid percussion (LFP) together with a peripheral bone fracture, i.e., tibia fracture, is introduced. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four experimental groups: controls (n = 10), animals with TBI (n = 30), animals with tibia fracture (n = 30), and animals with CNT (n = 30). Morphological aspects of brain and bone injury were analyzed via standard histopathological procedures and x-ray. Trauma-induced neuromotor dysfunction was assessed using a standardized neuroscore. For interactive effects between injuries, we studied the extent and temporal pattern of circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels via immunoassay and callus formation at fracture sites by means of microradiography. LFP produced an ipsilateral lesion with cortical contusion, hemorrhage, mass shift, and neuronal cell loss (adjacent cortex and hippocampus CA-2/-3), along with contralateral neuromotor dysfunction. X-rays confirmed complete fractures in the middle of the bone shaft. The type of injury (P < 0.001) and time (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with increased IL-6 levels. CNT produced the highest IL-6 plasma levels with a maximum peak at 6 h after trauma (P < 0.001). Similarly, callus formation at fracture sites in CNT was significantly increased versus fracture only (P < 0,01).

3435,"The Mayo Clinic gamma knife experience: indications and initial results OBJECTIVE: To review the results and expectations of contemporary stereotactic radiosurgery.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,033 consecutive patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 1990 and January 1998.RESULTS: The number of patients undergoing radiosurgery increased from 57 in 1990 to 216 in 1997. Of 97 patients with arteriovenous malformations who underwent follow-up angiography 2 years or more after a single radiosurgical procedure, 72 (74%) had complete obliteration of the vascular malformation. Of 209 patients who underwent radiosurgery for benign tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, or pituitary adenomas) and had radiologic studies after 2 years or more of follow-up, tumor growth control was noted in 200 (96%). Tumor growth was also controlled in 90% of brain metastatic lesions at a median of 7 months after radiosurgery. Of 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia and follow-up for more than 2 months, 14 (70%) were free of pain after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective management strategy for a wide variety of intracranial disorders. Use of radiosurgical treatment should continue to increase as more data become available on the long-term results of this procedure.",Excluded

3544,"Mechanisms of disease: DNA repair defects and neurological disease In this Review, familial and sporadic neurological disorders reported to have an etiological link with DNA repair defects are discussed, with special emphasis placed on the molecular link between the disease phenotype and the precise DNA repair defect. Of the 15 neurological disorders listed, some of which have symptoms of progeria, six - spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this induces. Five of the conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) display a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, four (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) exhibit an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, and four (ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) exhibit defects in genes involved in repairing double-strand breaks. The current overall picture indicates that oxidative stress is a major causative factor in genomic instability in the brain, and that the nature of the resulting neurological phenotype depends on the pathway through which the instability is normally repaired.",Excluded
3385,"Capillary optics for neutron capture therapy The development of capillary neutron optics permits a new technology for neutron capture therapy involving the application of a focused thermal neutron beam at the medically optimal location within the patient. A subthermal neutron beam begins to converge as it travels through a neutron 'lens,' reaching a narrow focus within a tube that allows it to pass directly to the treatment region. This technique results in a substantially lower dose to untreated parts of the patient and a substantially weaker radiation field in the treatment room generally. Additional advantages include the relative ease of thermal neutron generation and the ability to shield the patient completely and effectively from fast neutrons or gamma rays originating at the neutron source. This work describes the application of capillary optics to neutron capture therapy, along with Monte Carlo calculations of the neutron flux profiles within a patient for an optimized system design. Specific dose profiles for the case of boron neutron capture therapy within the brain are also provided.",Excluded
3354,"Radio frequency radiation-related cancer: assessing causation in the occupational/military setting BACKGROUND AND AIM: We reexamine whether radio frequency radiation (RFR) in the occupational and military settings is a human carcinogen.METHODS: We extended an analysis of an already-reported case series of patients with cancer previously exposed to whole-body prolonged RFR, mainly from communication equipment and radar. We focused on hematolymphatic (HL) cancers. We used analysis by percentage frequency (PF) of a cancer type, which is the proportion of a specific cancer type relative to the total number of cancer cases. We also examined and analyzed the published data on three other cohort studies from similar military settings from different countries.RESULTS: The PF of HL cancers in the case series was very high, at 40% with only 23% expected for the series age and gender profile, confidence interval CI95%: 26-56%, p<0.01, 19 out of 47 patients had HL cancers. We also found high PF for multiple primaries. As for the three other cohort studies: In the Polish military sector, the PF of HL cancers was 36% in the exposed population as compared to 12% in the unexposed population, p<0.001. In a small group of employees exposed to RFR in Israeli defense industry, the PF of HL cancers was 60% versus 17% expected for the group age and gender profile, p<0.05. In Belgian radar battalions the HL PF was 8.3% versus 1.4% in the control battalions as shown in a causes of deaths study and HL cancer mortality rate ratio was 7.2 and statistically significant. Similar findings were reported on radio amateurs and Korean war technicians. Elevated risk ratios were previously reported in most of the above studies.CONCLUSIONS: The consistent association of RFR and highly elevated HL cancer risk in the four groups spread over three countries, operating different RFR equipment types and analyzed by different research protocols, suggests a cause-effect relationship between RFR and HL cancers in military/occupational settings. While complete measurements of RFR exposures were not available and rough exposure assessments from patients interviews and from partial exposure data were used instead, we have demonstrated increased HL cancers in occupational groups with relatively high RFR exposures. Our findings, combined with other studies, indicate that exposures incurred in the military settings evaluated here significantly increased the risk of HL cancers. Accordingly, the RFR military exposures in these occupations should be substantially reduced and further efforts should be undertaken to monitor and measure those exposures and to follow cohorts exposed to RFR for cancers and other health effects. Overall, the epidemiological studies on excess risk for HL and other cancers together with brain tumors in cellphone users and experimental studies on RFR and carcinogenicity make a coherent case for a cause-effect relationship and classifying RFR exposure as a human carcinogen (IARC group 1).",Excluded

The new human (h) gene, termed hREC2, bears striking resemblance to several others, including hRAD51 and hLIM15. hREC2 is located on human chromosome 14 at q23-24. The overall amino acid sequence reveals characteristic elements of a RECA-like gene yet harbors an src-like phosphorylation site curiously absent from hRAD51 and hLIM15. Unlike these two relatives, hREC2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues including lung, liver, placenta, pancreas, leukocytes, colon, small intestine, brain, and heart, as well as thymus, prostate, spleen, and uterus. Of greatest interest is that hREC2 is undetectable by reverse transcription-coupled PCR in tissue culture unless the cells are treated by ionizing radiation.",Excluded

2463,"Glutamate microinjection into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus attenuates ulcerative colitis in rats AIM: To investigate the effects of glutamate microinjection into hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats and to explore the relevant mechanisms.METHODS: 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (100 mg/kg in 50% ethanol) was instilled into the colon of adult male SD rats to induce UC. A colonic damage score (CDS) was used to indicate the severity of the colonic mucosal damage. The pathological changes in the colonic mucosa were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, biochemical analyses or ELISA. Ten minutes before UC induction, drugs were microinjected into the relevant nuclei in rat brain to produce chemical stimulation or chemical lesion.RESULTS: Microinjection of glutamate (3, 6 and 12 mug) into the PVN dose-dependently decreased the CDS in UC rats. This protective effect was eliminated after kainic acid (0.3 mug) was microinjected into PVN or into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that caused chemical lesion of these nuclei. This protective effect was also prevented when the AVP-V1 receptor antagonist DPVDAV (200 ng) was microinjected into the NTS. The discharge frequency of the vagus was markedly decreased following microinjection of glutamate into the PVN. Microinjection of glutamate into the PVN in UC rats significantly increased the cell proliferation and anti-oxidant levels, and decreased the apoptosis and Bax and caspase 3 expression levels and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors in the colonic mucosa.CONCLUSION: The activation of hypothalamic PVN exerts protective effects against UC, which is mediated by the NTS and vagus. The effects may be achieved via anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory factors.",Excluded

3524,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 muM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K<sup>+</sup> conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow afterhyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC<inf>50</inf> of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF<inf>9-41</inf> (5 muM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow afterhyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow afterhyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded

A secondary aim was to investigate the relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures.METHODS: In total, 37 patients received voice rehabilitation post-radiotherapy and 37 patients constituted the irradiated control group. Outcome measures were mean CPPS for connected speech and ratings with the auditory-perceptual Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain (GRBAS) scale. Outcome measures were analyzed 1 (baseline), 6, 12, and 24 months post-radiotherapy, where voice rehabilitation was conducted between the first two time-points. Additional recordings were acquired from vocally healthy participants for comparison.RESULTS: CPPS values of the voice rehabilitation group and vocally healthy group were not significantly different at 24 months post-radiotherapy. Ten out of 19 patients who received voice rehabilitation yielded a CPPS value above the threshold for normal voice 24 months post-radiotherapy, compared to 11 out of 26 in the irradiated control group. No statistically significant correlations were found between CPPS and perceptual parameters of GRBAS.CONCLUSION: Voice rehabilitation for irradiated laryngeal cancer patients may have positive effects on voice quality up to 24 months post-radiotherapy. The relationship between CPPS and GRBAS as well as the applicability of CPPS for evaluation over several points of measurement needs to be studied further.",Excluded

We hypothesized that HU would elicit anhedonia, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and increased arrhythmogenesis. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats confined to 10-14 days of HU, or casted control (CC) condition were surgically instrumented with indwelling vascular catheters, a radiotelemetry transmitter or an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrode. Anhedonia was measured through sucrose preference and the response to ICSS. Sequential autonomic blockade following administration of propranolol and atropine and time-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were used to measure sympathovagal balance. Cardiac arrhythmias were produced and scored following sympathetic stimulation (SS) via isoproterenol administration and brief handling/restraint. HU resulted in reductions in both sucrose preference and ICSS. Propranolol administration elicited a significantly greater bradycardia in HU vs. CC rats, while the tachycardic response to methyl-atropine was nearly abolished in HU rats. HU resulted in a significantly lower HRV and a greater arrhythmic burden following SS. Thus, HU elicits behavioral signs consistent with psychological depression, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and an increased vulnerability to cardiac arrhythmias.",Excluded

The ectodermic origin of melanocytes and the presence of melanin in the substantia nigra are the theoretic basis of the experimental use of this class of tracers for melanoma imaging.METHODS: Eleven patients with proven metastatic melanoma entered the study. Whole-body and planar scintigrams were performed 2, 4 and 24 hr after intravenous injection of a mean tracer activity of 205 MBq. The dosimetric evaluation was performed by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee method.RESULTS: The [123I]-(S)-IBZM scans allowed the detection of all six cutaneous lesions, five of six superficial pathologic lymph nodes, four of five pulmonary and one of two hepatic metastases. The maximum tumor-to-background ratio was 2.6 in planar images. The hepatobiliary excretion of the tracer may limit detection of intra-abdominal lesions. Dosimetry is similar to data for nononcologic patients.CONCLUSION: Although it is unclear if the mechanism of radiopharmaceutical uptake in melanoma is due to binding to membrane receptors or due to interactions with intracellular structures, radiolabeled benzamide is a promising tracer to detect melanoma.",Excluded

The dosimetry to otologic structures has not been routinely analyzed and radiation treatment planning does not currently attempt to specifically avoid the inner ear structures when dosimetry is calculated. Recent studies demonstrate that up to 30% of patients experience sensorineural hearing loss on multimodality therapy with cisplatin and radiation.METHODS: In the current case series, radiation dosimetry to otologic structures was calculated from computed tomogram treatment plans on patients. Fifteen nasopharyngeal, oral cavity, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer patients were analyzed.RESULTS: Between 8% and 102% of the total dose is delivered to the petrous bone/cochlea, with 4 of 15 patients getting more than 50% of the dose to at least one cochlea The mastoid air cells received between 3% and 75% of the total dose, with higher doses being delivered to patients with bulky high neck metastases or nasopharyngeal tumors. The eustachian tubes received between 20% and 102% of the total dose, with 10 of 15 patients receiving more than 50% of the dose to this anatomic site.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the cochlea and eustachian tubes receive significant radiation during treatment, particularly in nasopharyngeal cancer patients.

3639,"Different levodopa actions on the extracellular dopamine pools in the rat striatum Levodopa has been the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease for several decades, but the precise mechanism for its therapeutic action is still not well understood. To date, little distinction has been made between the effects of levodopa on the different brain DA pools. We studied the levodopa action on two extracellular DA pools: one was analyzed by microdialysis (often considered as indicative of volume transmission) and the other by in vivo amperometry during nigrostriatal cell stimulation (more indicative of neurotransmission). Levodopa administration induced a moderate (increased 200%) and tardy (began at 60 min) increase in the DA-pool measured by microdialysis, an effect that increased (increased 500%) and accelerated (began at 10 min) after DA-cell degeneration. Levodopa action on the DA-pool measured by amperometry was very fast (10 min) and prominent (increased 600%) in normal rats. The DA-denervated striatum showed a fast exhaustion during cell stimulation, which prevented further study of the levodopa effect on the DA amperometry-pool under this condition. This study suggests a different kinetic for levodopa action on the volume transmitter and neurotransmitter DA-pool, showing marked changes in levodopa action in the denervated striatum.",Excluded

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgically treated PCMs larger than 2 cm.METHODS: A series of 199 consecutive patients (137 females, 68.8 %) with PCMs larger than 2 cm from between 1993 and 2003 were included. The clinical charts, radiographs, and follow-ups were evaluated.RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 111 (55.8 %) patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 65, and partial resection (PR) in 23. Cranial nerve dysfunctions were the most common complications and occurred in 133 (66.8 %) cases. The surgical mortality was 2.0 %. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores significantly decreased 1 month after the operations (preoperative KPS = 76.8 and postoperative KPS = 64.8; p = 0.011, Paired-samples t test). Long-term follow-ups were obtained in 142 patients, the follow-up duration was 171.6 months, and the most recent KPS was 83.2. Permanent morbidities remained in 24 patients (18.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that brainstem edema and tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter were independent risk factors in terms of outcomes (KPS < 80). The recurrence/progression rates were 14.5, 31.8, and 53.3 % for the GTR, STR, and PR cases, respectively (p = 0.002, Pearson chi (2) test). Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the remnants exhibited good tumor control.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes and low mortality were achieved with the microsurgical management of medium and large PCMs; however, the rates of cranial nerves dysfunction remained high.

3241,"Measured attenuation correction methods Accurate attenuation correction is a prerequisite for the determination of exact local radioactivity concentrations in positron emission tomography. Attenuation correction factors range from 4-5 in brain studies to 50-100 in whole body measurements. This report gives an overview of the different methods of determining the attenuation correction factors by transmission measurements using an external positron emitting source. The long-lived generator nuclide 68Ge/68Ga is commonly used for this purpose. The additional patient dose from the transmission source is usually a small fraction of the dose due to the subsequent emission measurement. Ring-shaped transmission sources as well as rotating point or line sources are employed in modern positron tomographs. By masking a rotating line or point source, random and scattered events in the transmission scans can be effectively suppressed. The problems of measured attenuation correction are discussed: transmission/emission mismatch, random and scattered event contamination, counting statistics, transmission/emission scatter compensation, transmission scan after administration of activity to the patient.

The instruments used included: Piper Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Scale. Data on cancer stage, prostate specific antigen levels, hematocrit, patient's body weight and radiation dosage were recorded. Patients were evaluated preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy, and at 4-5 weeks follow-up. Thirty-six veterans with localized prostate cancer were studied. Mean age was 66.9 years (range 55-79). Duration of treatment was 7-8 weeks. Univariate procedure and Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test were used to examine changes in pretreatment scores for each of the three subsequent study periods. To adjust for multiple comparisons Bonferroni test was used. Spearman Correlations were calculated among parameters. No significant changes were noted in mean scores of hematocrit and body weight during the study period. On the Piper Fatigue Scale, adjusted for multiple comparisons, the median scores were significantly higher at completion of radiotherapy as compared with preradiotherapy values. Three patients (8%) were experienced fatigue according to Piper Fatigue Scale before treatment as compared to nine patients (25%) at completion of radiotherapy. On Prostate Cancer Specific and Physical Well Being subscales of the Functional Assessment for Prostate Cancer Therapy, the scores were significantly lower at middle and completion of radiotherapy than at pretreatment. At preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy and follow-up evaluation, patients scoring higher on the Piper Fatigue Scale were more likely to report a poorer quality of Physical Well Being on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostates. No significant changes were noted in the Beck Depression Inventory and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores during treatment. Eight patients scored 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory before starting radiotherapy, suggesting depressive symptomatology. Of these, only seven patients scored 10 or more at completion of treatment. The incidence of fatigue is lower in our study than in previously published data. A relationship exists between fatigue scores and physical well being subscale scores. Higher scores on the Piper Fatigue Scale at the completion of radiotherapy, as well as no changes on depression and sleepiness scales, suggest that fatigue may not be the result of depression or sleep disturbance. Based upon our previous work, we propose that the physical expression of fatigue may be secondary to a decline in neuromuscular efficiency and enhanced muscle fatigue.",Excluded

2848,"A prospective study of thyroid function after radiotherapy for central nervous system and head and neck malignancies Purpose/Objective: Few studies evaluate endocrine gland function following radiotherapy (RT). We conducted a single-institution prospective study to understand the effect of RT on pituitary and thyroid function in adults. Material(s) and Method(s): Adult patients who received fractionated RT for non-metastatic head and neck cancer and benign intracranial neoplasms were eligible. Patients with a history of thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamic surgery or baseline hormonal supplementation were excluded. Baseline endocrine labs were obtained prior to RT and at 6- month intervals for 5 years. A dose-volume histogram report was generated for the hypothalamus, thyroid, and pituitary gland. Hypothyroidism (HT) was defined as TSH level > 5.0 mIU/L or T4 < 0.8 ng/dL. The primary endpoint was to establish the incidence and threshold dose for RT-related endocrine dysfunction. This interim analysis reports on thyroid function for the first 50 of a planned 200 patients enrolled. Result(s): From October 2006 to May 2008, 50 patients were enrolled with a median follow up of 67 months (range, 17-82 months). Forty-two patients were treated for head and neck (HN) cancers, and eight were treated for benign central nervous (CNS) tumors. No patient was on thyroid supplementation at baseline. The median prescription dose was 6000 cGy in 30 fractions (range, 4500-7000 cGy). Thirty-six patients (72%) were treated adjuvantly and 31 patients (62%) also received concurrent chemotherapy. Primary HT incidence was 60% (n=30) at a median of 12 months (range, 2.9-58.7). The 12-, 24-, 48-, and 60-month freedom from thyroid dysfunction was 78%, 52%, 47.5%, and 33.7%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (42%) received thyroid replacement therapy with a median time to therapy of 3.5 months after diagnosis of HT. The mean thyroid dose in patients with HT was 6136 cGy (range, 3958-6930) compared to 2825 cGy (range, 0-7032) for those without HT. The incidence of HT was 11% (n=2) vs. 87.5% (n=28) for patients with a mean thyroid dose below vs. above 5000 cGy, respectively (p<0.0001). No secondary HT was observed, and the mean pituitary dose for patients with HT was 1065 cGy.

3538,"Pre-treatment of adult rats with high doses of erythropoietin induces caspase-9 but prevents light-induced retinal injury Erythropoietin (Epo) had been shown to have a neuroprotective effect independent from its erythropoietic properties. In this study, we tested whether Epo could protect the retina from damage induced by a long period of moderate light insult and how it protected. First, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) by human recombinant Epo at 5000 or 30,000U/kg to assess Epo concentration in plasma and retina. Second, rats were untreated or injected i.p. with Epo at 30,000U/kg, 1 or 4h before being placed in constant light (24h; 2200lux). Electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded before treatment, 1day and 15days (D15) after light exposure. After the last ERG, eyes were taken for histology. In parallel, we tested Epo protection against oxidative stressors on isolated retinas and its effect on caspase-9 activity. Epo injected at 30,000U/kg body weight, 4h before exposure to the damaging light, protected retinal function and structure against light damage and induced an increase in caspase-9 activity and expression. Epo had no direct or indirect protective effect against free radicals-induced death on isolated retinas. Epo protected the retina from a long period of moderate light exposure through a mechanism independent from a free radical scavenging property or an antioxidant facilitating activity. The activation of caspase-9, 4h after Epo injection, corresponding to the start of light exposure, suggests that caspase-9 plays a role in neuroprotection.",Excluded

2439,"Radiotherapy of maxillary cancer using 9 equi-spaced beam coplanar beam arrangement and 9 non-coplanar beam arrangement with beam angle optimization - A dosimetric comparison Background: IMRT is a novel radiotherapy that can deliver high conformal homogeneous dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding tissues and structures. Conventional routine IMRT usually uses equi-spaced beam arrangement of 5 to 9. However, in recent development, manipulating the beam arrangement of IMRT is offered in beam angle optimization (BAO), in which it automatically chooses optimized beam angles in either coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements. In Pugachev et al. (2001) study it has been suggested that improvement of the dose distribution was seen in complicated head and neck cancer cases with BAO. Nevertheless, opposite opinion has been raised by Stein et al. (1997) which stated that the marginal gain by manipulating beam angle diminished when there are more than 7 beams. Notwithstanding the controversy in study results, it was observed that careful selection of beam orientation contributed to a better dose distribution in the final treatment plan in clinical experience. This study is to investigate the dosimetric effect of manipulating beam angles with BAO in maxillary cancer cases compared with 9 equi-spaced beam co-planar arrangement. Method(s): The subjects in this study were recruited from the Princess Margaret Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the period of 1st Jan 2006 to 31st Dec 2010. Planning computed tomography (CT) images of the samples were retrospectively restored. Five samples were recruited using random sampling. It was an experimental study to test the effect of using equispaced beams, BAO and VMAT in IMRT. The parameters for comparison are tumour dose conformity, homogeneity; and the OARs maximum, mean dose. 2 plans were produced for each recruited patients. One using 9 equispaced beam arrangement and the other using 9 non-coplanar field using BAO. Result(s): For the five recruited patients, both 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement and BAO resulted in clinically satisfactory dose distribution and were of similar quality. It was found that IMRT plans with BAO resulted in better OARs sparing, including the parotid, cochlear, eyes, optic nerves, the optic chiasm and brain stem. In terms of target coverage, 4 out of 5 plans produced better in BAO when compared with 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement. Conclusion(s): The effect of the selection of beam angle orientations was significant within the samples. The choice of beam orientations is a factor affecting the dosimetric outcome even when the beam number is equal to 9.",Excluded
2864,"Increased activity and involvement of caspase-3 in radiation-induced apoptosis in neural cells precursors from developing rat brain Using primary cultures of neural precursor cells of cortex from developing rat brain, we demonstrated the involvement of caspase-3 in the apoptotic process induced by gamma irradiation. The precursor nature of cells was confirmed by nestin and GFAP immunoreactivity and by the capacity of differentiation in neuronal and glial cells after 5 days in culture. Neural precursors were irradiated with single doses ranging from 0.1 to 4Gy. Cellular death, determined 24 h post-irradiation (pi) was dose-dependent and the induction of apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and hypodiploid DNA peak represented by the ""sub G1"" region. For the higher doses, apoptosis was evident after 4-6 h pi and increased during 24 h. Caspase-3 activity increased with doses and was maximal at 4-6 h pi with 3Gy and remained similar with 4Gy. The protection from radiation-induced apoptosis by caspase-3 inhibitor, zDEVD-fmk, confirmed that this enzyme is involved in the apoptotic mechanism in this system. The possibility of using this tissue culture system for studying the effects of ionizing radiation on morphological and molecular differentiation was considered.",Excluded
3395,"Dye-induced photolesion in the mammalian retina: glial and neuronal reactions Irradiation in the presence of a dye applied to the extracellular space is known to produce degenerative features in irradiated neurones and fibers. In the present study, we confirmed the potential use of this procedure as a lesion technique by showing the removal of degenerating elements as part of the glial reaction to the lesion. The dye Rose Bengal was applied to the vitreous body of a rat eye and a T-shaped irradiation pattern was projected onto the retina within the absorption band of the dye. Degenerative features were restricted to the irradiated area, which could be readily identified from its shape. Retinae examined after various survival times showed that macrophages invaded the damaged area within 1 day, and that mitotic activity of reactive glial cells subsequently occurred in the vicinity of the wound. Both cell types were identified by their structural features. Macrophages were also revealed by a staining technique using the dye Nile Red, whereas reactive glial cells were immunolabeled with an antibody directed against the glial fibrillary acidic protein. Reactive glial cells helped the macrophages to gradually remove injured cells and damaged processes. Their main task, however, appeared to be in scar formation, since their processes seemed to suture the lips of the wound together and restore the limiting membrane at the inner retina. After 2 months' survival time, the parent ganglion cells of most disrupted axon bundles had retrogradely degenerated, but regenerating ganglion cell axons were also observed. These results provide some new data about healing processes in the retina. They demonstrate that the dye-induced photolesion technique can be used to either remove or axotomize selected neurones in neural networks which have been made optically accessible.",Excluded
2509,"Orientin protects neuronal cell line from hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage via up-regulating nrf2/keap1 redox signalling pathways Introduction: Orientin is a water-soluble flavonoid C-glycoside which is isolable from Ocimum sanctum. It has been suggested to have antioxidant, antiviral, vasodilatation, cardioprotective, radiation protective effect, neuroprotective effect and to be able to cross blood-brain-barrier. Thus, it is a potential treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Furthermore, oxidative stress has been highly implicated in the progression of ND, hence, this leads to the study on Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway for the targeted effective therapies of ND in the future. Objective(s): To determine the effects of orientin on nitric oxide levels, intracellular calcium levels and the mechanism by which orientin protects SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage. Method(s): Orientin at pre-determined maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD), 20 muM and half MNTD (O MNTD), 10muM were subjected to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h, followed by 150 muM of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> oxidative induction for 24 h at 37degreeC. The Griess assay and Fluo-4 NW calcium assay were then performed to measure the NO levels and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by a microplate reader respectively. The regulation of Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway was analysed by Western blotting. Result(s): MNTD and O MNTD significantly reduced NO levels and significantly reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by 33.49% and 28.20% when compare to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment alone.

2747,"Encoding of stimulus frequency and sensor motion in the posterior medial thalamic nucleus In all sensory systems, information is processed along several parallel streams. In the vibrissa-to-barrel cortex system, these include the lemniscal system and the lesser-known paralemniscal system. The posterior medial nucleus (POm) is the thalamic structure associated with the latter pathway. Previous studies suggested that POm response latencies are positively correlated with stimulation frequency and negatively correlated with response duration, providing a basis for a phase locked loop-temporal decoding of stimulus frequency. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing response latencies of POm neurons, in both awake and anesthetized rats, to vibrissae deflections at frequencies between 0.3 and 11 Hz. We found no significant, systematic correlation between stimulation frequency and the latency or duration of POm responses. We obtained similar findings from recording in awake rats, in rats under different anesthetics, and in anesthetized rats in which the reticular activating system was stimulated. These findings suggest that stimulus frequency is not reliably reflected in response latency of POm neurons. We also tested the hypothesis that POm neurons respond preferentially to sensor motion, that is, they respond to whisking in air, without contacts. We recorded from awake, head-restrained rats while monitoring vibrissae movements. All POm neurons responded to passive whisker deflections, but none responded to noncontact whisking. Thus like their counterparts in the trigeminal ganglion, POm neurons may not reliably encode whisking kinematics. These observations suggest that POm neurons might not faithfully encode vibrissae inputs to provide reliable information on vibrissae movements or contacts.",Excluded

3409,"Light-induced Egr-1 expression in the striate cortex of the opossum In the present study, immunocytochemistry was used to assess the expression of Egr-1 nuclear protein across selected regions of the opossum visual system. In light-deprived (LD) animals, only a few scattered cell nuclei were found throughout the striate cortex (V1). Exposure to light promoted a significant increase in the density of Egr-1 labeled nuclei in V1. Laminar distribution of immunoreactive nuclei in light-stimulated animals (LS) tended to vary with topography: the lateral region, which corresponds to the central representation of the visual field, appeared to have higher density of cells expressing protein in the supragranular layers, as compared to the medial region, which corresponds to the representation of the peripheral field of vision. Finally, LS animals displayed a narrow band of labeled cell nuclei in the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and throughout the anteroposterior extent of the superior colliculus (SC). In contrast, almost no Egr-1 immunolabeling was found in the IGL and SC of LD animals.

2967,"Fragments of ATM which have dominant-negative or complementing activity The ATM protein has been implicated in pathways controlling cell cycle checkpoints, radiosensitivity, genetic instability, and aging. Expression of ATM fragments containing a leucine zipper motif in a human tumor cell line abrogated the S-phase checkpoint after ionizing irradiation and enhanced radiosensitivity and chromosomal breakage. These fragments did not abrogate irradiation-induced G1 or G2 checkpoints, suggesting that cell cycle checkpoint defects alone cannot account for chromosomal instability in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells. Expression of the carboxy-terminal portion of ATM, which contains the PI-3 kinase domain, complemented radiosensitivity and the S-phase checkpoint and reduced chromosomal breakage after irradiation in AT cells. These observations suggest that ATM function is dependent on interactions with itself or other proteins through the leucine zipper region and that the PI-3 kinase domain contains much of the significant activity of ATM.",Excluded
3074,"Nerve specific modulation of somatosensory inflow to cerebral cortex during submaximal sustained contraction in first dorsal interosseous muscle Modulation of the early component (latency approximately 20-30 ms) of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and that of the middle and long latency cutaneous reflexes was examined in 13 healthy volunteers during fatiguing submaximal voluntary contraction (20% maximum) of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). The SEP was evoked by stimulating the ulnar nerve (U-SEP), a mixed nerve innervating the FDI muscle, the purely cutaneous nerves of the 2nd digit (D2-SEP) and the 5th digit (D5-SEP). The cutaneous reflex was recorded concurrently with D2-SEP. The size of D2- and D5-SEP significantly decreased during fatiguing contraction as compared to rest, and the decrease in both SEPs persisted throughout fatiguing contraction. In contrast, the significant decrease in the gating of U-SEP disappeared during the latter phase of fatiguing contraction. The ratio (reflex response/background EMG) of excitatory E2 (latency approximately 60-90 ms) and E3 (approximately 120-180 ms) responses following D2 stimulation significantly increased during the middle or latter phase of fatiguing contraction. In contrast, no significant changes in inhibitory I1 and I2 were seen. The release of the attenuation of U-SEP and a constant gating of the D2- and D5-SEP suggests that the brain selectively permits the muscular afferent inflow into the cortex during fatiguing contraction. An increase in the E2 and E3 reflex ratio of cutaneous reflexes during the later phase of fatiguing contraction most likely results from an increase in the excitability of the motor cortex.",Excluded
3429,"[Rules of application and mode of action of transcranial direct current stimulation in neurorehabilitation: primary motor cortex] Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging technique of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been found useful in facilitating treatment of various neurological disorders, especially stroke. Currently available criteria for single application of several minutes-long stimulation at 1-2 mA have been considered safe. However, knowledge regarding safety parameters of repeated and long-term electrical stimulation is so far limited. Studies on the use of tDCS focus predominantly on the motor cortex. They demonstrate that weak direct current is capable of eliciting cortical excitability changes which occur during and after stimulation. The nature of these changes is specific for current polarity - anodal stimulation enhances excitability, and cathodal reduces it. Studies indicate that tDCS effects are generated by polarity-driven alterations of membrane potentials and efficacy modulations of specific neuronal receptors. According to interhemispheric competition models, possible mechanisms underlying functional improvements due to stimulation in patients with stroke are attributed to tDCS-induced modification of inappropriate interhemispheric inhibition.

Method(s): 233 patients with 257 meningeoma of the skull base (71.2%), falx (12.1%), convexity (14.4%) and meningeomatosis (2.3%) were treated between 01/2002 and 01/2015 at the Erlangen University Hospital. 81.7% (210) of patients received SRT postoperatively and 18.3% (47) as primary treatment. 119 (46.3%) had a WHO grade I, 64 (24.9%) grade II, 16 (6.2%) grade III meningioma. In 58 cases no histology was obtained, whereas 47 (18.3%) of which received SRT alone. SRT was given in 28 or 30 fractions.

3164,"Preliminary Results of Emergency Computed Tomography-Guided Ventricular Drain Placement-Precision for the Most Difficult Cases Background: External ventricular drainage (EVD) catheter placement is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. The study's objective was to compare a computed tomography (CT) bolt scan-guided approach for the placement of EVDs with conventional landmark-based insertion. Method(s): In this retrospective case-control study, we analyzed patients undergoing bolt-kit EVD catheter placement, either CT-guided or landmark-based, between 2013 and 2016. The CT bolt scan-guided approach was based on a dose-reduced CT scan after bolt fixation with immediate image reconstruction along the axis of the bolt to evaluate the putative insertion axis. If needed, angulation of the bolt was corrected and the procedure repeated before the catheter was inserted. Primary endpoint was the accuracy of insertion. Secondary endpoints were the overall number of attempts, duration of intervention, complication rates, and cumulative radiation dose. Result(s): In total, 34 patients were included in the final analysis. In the group undergoing CT-guided placement, the average ventricle width was significantly smaller (P = 0.04) and average midline shift significantly more pronounced (P = 0.01). CT-guided placement resulted in correct positioning of the catheter in the ipsilateral frontal horn in all 100% of the cases compared with landmark-guided insertion (63%; P = 0.01). Application of the CT-guided approach increased the number of total CT scans (3.6 +/- 1.9) and the overall radiation dose (3.34 +/- 1.61 mSv) compared with the freehand insertion group (1.84 +/- 2.0 mSv and 1.55 +/- 1.66 mSv). No differences were found for the other secondary outcome parameters. Conclusion(s): CT-guided bolt-kit EVD catheter placement is feasible and accurate in the most difficult cases.

Confluent monolayers of synovial fibroblasts (HIG-82) and neuroblastoma cells (5Y) were exposed in bath solution to 0-75 mA/m(2) (0-56 mV/m), 60 Hz. Single channel conductance, cell membrane current-voltage (I-V) curves, and Ca(2+) influx were measured using the nystatin single and double patch methods. The conductances of the closed and open states of the gap junction channel in HIG-82 cells were each significantly reduced (by 0.76 and 0.39 pA, respectively) in cells exposed to 20 mA/m(2). Current densities as low as 10 mA/m(2) significantly increased Ca(2+) influx in HIG-82 cells. No effects were seen in 5Y cells. The I-V curves of the plasma membranes of both types of cells were independent of 60 Hz electric fields and current densities, 0-75 mA/m(2), indicating that the effect of the 60 Hz fields on GJIC in HIG-82 cells was not mediated by a change in membrane potential. We conclude that ELF electric fields can alter GJIC in synovial cells via a mechanism that does not depend on changes in membrane potential, but may depend on Ca(2+) influx. The results open the possibility that GJIC mediated responses in synovial cells, such as for example, their secretory responses to proinflammatory cytokines, could be antagonized by the application of ELF electric fields.",Excluded

Apart from playing its major role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage, ATM, when mutated, can additionally determine oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In the present paper we aim to investigate the levels of oxidative stress potentially induced by the oxidizing rodent renal carcinogen KBrO<inf>3</inf> in ATM-defective lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from four classical AT patients (with different ATM mutations), one AT variant with reduced hypersensitivity to X rays, obligate AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control. A possible modulatory involvement of PARP in potentially induced oxidative stress is also evaluated following its inhibition with 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB). Treatments with KBrO<inf>3</inf> clearly showed a marked hypersensitivity of the ATM-defective LCLs, including the AT variant. A marked and statistically significant reduction of KBrO<inf>3</inf>-induced chromosomal damage following inhibition of PARP by 3-AB, was observed in all AT LCLs, but not in those from the AT variant, AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control.

From August 2008 to December 2012, 30 patients with recurrent glioma underwent salvage SRT. The initial histological diagnoses were World Health Organization (WHO) grades II, III, and IV in 6, 9, and 15 patients, respectively. Morphologically, the type of recurrence was classified as diffuse or other. Two methods of clinical target delineation were used: A, a contrast-enhancing tumor; or B, a contrast-enhancing tumor with a 3-10-mm margin and/or surrounding fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) high-intensity areas. The prescribed dose was 22.5-35 Gy delivered in five fractions at an isocenter using a dynamic conformal arc technique. The overall survival (OS) and local control probability (LCP) after SRT were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A univariate analysis was used to test the effect of clinical variables on OS/LCP. The median follow-up period was 272 days after SRT. The OS and LCP were 83% and 56% at 6 months after SRT, respectively. Morphologically, the tumor type correlated significantly with both OS and LCP (P = 0.006 and <0.001, respectively). The method of target delineation also had a significant influence on LCP (P = 0.016). Grade 3 radiation necrosis was observed in two patients according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.

PPI-induced achlorhydria increases circulating gastrin and chromogranin A (CGA). CGA is a widely used biomarker for the diagnosis and follow-up for gut-based neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). PPI-induced increases in CGA or gastrin may falsely suggest the presence of a NET when none exists. Pancreastatin, a fragment of CGA, is also commonly used to diagnose and follow NETs. Aim(s): We hypothesized that chronic PPI use would increase circulating plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin levels. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients who used PPIs for six months or more (mean duration 3.1 +/-2.5 years) and a separate control group of thirty patients who never used antacid medications were prospectively evaluated with plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin determinations. Result(s): Chronic PPI use resulted in significant increases in CGA (15.1+/-11 vs. 131+/-207 ng/ml, p=0.005) and significant increases in gastrin (34.8+/-22.3 vs. 167.8+/-136.2 pg/ml, p=0.001) compared to controls.

3161,"Metabolic correction of cerebral radiation syndrome DNA strand breaks that occur after irradiation activate the repair enzyme adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase, which consumes NAD as a substrate and causes depletion first of neuronal NAD and then of the ATP pool. This is considered to be the crucial link in the mechanism underlying the cerebral radiation syndrome (CRS). In this study, two ways to correct the CRS metabolically were examined: (a) prevention of depletion of NAD after irradiation by administration of the enzyme inhibitor nicotinamide and (b) shunting the NAD-dependent oxidative phosphorylation pathway of ATP resynthesis by administration of a substrate of NAD-independent oxidation, succinate. Cerebral lesions induced by radiation were modeled by irradiation of rats or rat brain homogenates with 150 Gy of X rays. The manifestations of CRS in rats (excitement, convulsions, etc.) closely resembled those seen after acute hypoxia. In brain homogenates, pyruvate tetrazolium-reductase activity decreased after irradiation and could be corrected by addition of NAD after irradiation. Succinate tetrazolium-reductase activity was not affected by irradiation. Oxygen consumption by brain homogenates after irradiation in vitro and in situ decreased, as did oxygen consumption by rats in vivo after cranio-caudal irradiation. Administration of nicotinamide or succinate prevented both the postirradiation decrease in respiration (in both rats in vivo and brain homogenates in vitro) and the development of cerebral radiation syndrome.

The main objectives of this study were to: 1) investigate the long-term prevalence of radiation-induced trismus in patients treated for head and neck cancer according to two different fractionation schedules; and 2) model a dose-response relationship for trismus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Swedish ARTSCAN trial, a prospective randomised multicentre study comparing conventional and accelerated fractionation. A total of 124 patients agreed to a clinical ENT examination 21-127 months (median 66 months) after beginning radiation therapy. Trismus-related scores were assessed using the EORTC H&N35 Quality of Life questionnaire. The TheraBite( R) range of motion scale was used to measure maximal interincisal distance. The dose-response relationship for structures important for mastication and the temporomandibular joints was investigated by normal tissue complication probability modelling.RESULTS: No significant differences in patient-reported trismus or maximal interincisal distance were found between the two trial arms. Patient-reported moderate to high scores regarding trismus increased from 3% at the start of radiation therapy to 25% at the long-term follow-up. Maximal interincisal distance correlated significantly with patient-reported scores of trismus. The best dose-response fit to the endpoint data was found for the dose to the ipsilateral masseter.CONCLUSIONS: Trismus is a persistent complication after radiotherapy with 3D-conformal radiation therapy. We found no difference between the severity and prevalence of trismus between conventional and accelerated fractionation, but a significant correlation between the absorbed dose to the mastication structures and opening of the mouth. Further prospective studies may determine whether a reduced dose to structures important for mastication using intensity-modulated radiation therapy will reduce problems with trismus.",Excluded

Because the patients showed progression, docetaxel and ramucirumab chemotherapy was administered. Although two patients showed a clinical response, all patients developed grade 3 ILD during therapy. Furthermore, the patients developed respiratory failure and needed corticosteroid therapy. Although their condition improved owing to the therapy, the patients could not receive additional cancer treatment and died of cancer. On the basis of the results obtained, we speculated that although the regimen of docetaxel and ramucirumab after nivolumab therapy might be effective against non-small cell lung cancer, it might increase the risk for ILD in some patients.

3453,"A method of surgical laser treatment of trigeminal neuralgia Introduction: If conservative therapy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia is ineffective, different kinds of destruction of peripheral branches (alcoholization, phenol destructions, electric coagulation, etc.) are commonly used with subsequent development of marked perifocal cicatricial-commissural changes. Material(s) and Method(s): On the basis of advantages of high-energy laser radiation, we developed a method for treating trigeminal neuralgia by means of puncture laser destruction (neurotomy) of peripheral trigeminal branches on different levels. At first, a peripheral branch was blocked; if there was a positive clinical effect in the form of disappearance or significant reduction of a colicky pain, an optical quartz fibre 200-400 nm in diameter was inserted through an internal lumen of an intraneurally placed injection needle. The above quartz optical fibre serves for laser radiation influence with wavelength of 980 nm in a continuous mode using fractional portions by 2-4 seconds with an interval of 8-10 seconds and radiation power from 2 to 7 W until deep or total anaesthesia was achieved in the innervation area of a relevant nerve. Depending upon the diameter of a nerve, from 200 to 600 J were required. If necessary, the position of a needle with an optical fibre was changed, thereby causing a new focus of laser destruction until the required degree of innervation was achieved. During one operation it was possible to carry out laser destruction (neurotomy) of several nerve trunks. Result(s): From April 2011 to May 2012, 30 patients received treatment with use of a method of laser neurotomy of peripheral trigeminal branches. A positive effect was achieved in 27 cases. No complications were observed in the immediate and remote postoperative periods. Relapses were registered in 6 patients.",Excluded

3052,"Immunomodulatory effect of new quinolone derivative against cisplatin/gamma radiation-induced renal and brain toxicity in mice Treatment of cancer often requires exposure to radiation, which has several limitations involving non-specific toxicity toward normal cells, reducing the efficacy of treatment. Recent studies synthesize new quinolone derivatives to satisfy other purposes such as treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases. The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a new quinolone derivative; 2-(1-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (EHQA) and its possible mechanism against gamma radiation (IRR) and cisplatin (Cis) induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in mice. The structure of the newly synthesized quinolone derivative was elucidated by microanalytical and spectral data, which were found consistent with the assigned structures. Exposure to Cis and IRR significantly induced renal damage manifested by a significant increase in levels of urea and creatinine. Moreover, the exposure to both Cis and IRR significantly decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein; Bcl-2 in both renal and brain tissue homogenate accompanied by activation of an inflammatory marker; IL-17. Immunophenoting results showed an activation of T- lymphocytes marker; CD3 and B-lymphocytes marker; CD19. Interperitonial administration of EHQA significantly ameliorated the above-mentioned parameters. Overall, the present results indicated that EHQA is a promising anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. From the obtained results it can be concluded that EHQA could be a candidate as immunomodulatory agents. Further studies are required to establish its molecular mechanism.",Excluded
3640,"Selective chest imaging for blunt trauma patients: The national emergency X-ray utilization studies (NEXUS-chest algorithm) Chest imaging plays a prominent role in blunt trauma patient evaluation, but indiscriminate imaging is expensive, may delay care, and unnecessarily exposes patients to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. To improve diagnostic chest imaging utilization, we conducted 3 prospective multicenter studies over 12years to derive and validate decision instruments (DIs) to guide the use of chest x-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT). The first DI, NEXUS Chest x-ray, consists of seven criteria (Age >60years; rapid deceleration mechanism; chest pain; intoxication; altered mental status; distracting painful injury; and chest wall tenderness) and exhibits a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.2-99.4%) and a specificity of 13.3% (95% CI, 12.6%-14.0%) for detecting clinically significant injuries. We developed two NEXUS Chest CT DIs, which are both highly reliable in detecting clinically major injuries (sensitivity of 99.2%; 95% CI 95.4-100%). Designed primarily to focus on detecting major injuries, the NEXUS Chest CT-Major DI consists of six criteria (abnormal CXR; distracting injury; chest wall tenderness; sternal tenderness; thoracic spine tenderness; and scapular tenderness) and exhibits higher specificity (37.9%; 95% CI 35.8-40.1%). Designed to reliability detect both major and minor injuries (sensitivity 95.4%; 95% CI 93.6-96.9%) with resulting lower specificity (25.5%; 95% CI 23.5-27.5%), the NEXUS CT-All rule consists of seven elements (the six NEXUS CT-Major criteria plus rapid deceleration mechanism).

2599,"Exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields alters the calcium dynamics of cultured entorhinal cortex neurons Previous studies have revealed that extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) exposure affects neuronal dendritic spine density and NMDAR and AMPAR subunit expressions in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Although calcium signaling has a critical role in control of EC neuronal functions, however, it is still unclear whether the ELF-EMF exposure affects the EC neuronal calcium homeostasis. In the present study, using whole-cell recording and calcium imaging, we record the whole-cell inward currents that contain the voltage-gated calcium currents and show that ELF-EMF (50Hz, 1mT or 3mT, lasting 24h) exposure does not influence these currents. Next, we specifically isolate the high-voltage activated (HVA) and low-voltage activated (LVA) calcium channels-induced currents. Similarly, the activation and inactivation characteristics of these membrane calcium channels are also not influenced by ELF-EMF. Importantly, ELF-EMF exposure reduces the maximum amplitude of the high-K(+)-evoked calcium elevation in EC neurons, which is abolished by thapsigargin, a Ca(2+) ATPase inhibitor, to empty the intracellular calcium stores of EC neurons. Together, these findings indicate that ELF-EMF exposure specifically influences the intracellular calcium dynamics of cultural EC neurons via a calcium channel-independent mechanism.",Excluded
3103,"Peritumoural glutamate correlates with post-operative seizures in supratentorial gliomas To examine the impact of glutamate on post-operative seizures and survival in a cohort of patients with grade II to IV supratentorial glioma. A retrospective analysis was performed on 216 patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial gliomas. Primary explanatory variables were peritumoural and/or tumoural glutamate concentrations, glutamate transporter expression (EAAT2 and SXC). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis was performed with primary outcomes of time to first post-operative seizure and overall survival. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with de novo glioblastomas who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 47 (21.8 %), 34 (15.8 %) and 135 (62.5 %) WHO grade II, III and IV gliomas respectively were followed for a median of 15.8 months. Following multivariate analysis, there was a non-significant association between higher peritumoural glutamate concentrations and time to first post-operative seizure (HR 2.07, CI 0.98-4.37, p = 0.06). In subgroup analysis of 81 glioblastoma patients who received adjunct chemoradiotherapy, peritumoural glutamate concentration was significantly associated with time to first post-operative seizure (HR 3.10, CI 1.20-7.97, p = 0.02). In both the overall cohort and subgroup analysis no glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. Increased concentrations of peritumoural glutamate were significantly associated with shorter periods of post-operative seizure freedom in patients with de novo glioblastomas treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. No glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. These results suggest that therapies targeting glutamate may be beneficial in tumour associated epilepsy.",Excluded

The presence of acoustic radiation may result in an unreal bone conduction threshold, promoting an unreal air/bone gap in the high frequencies.AIM: aim to analyze the acoustic radiation effect on the extension of air/bone gap at 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz.MATERIALS AND METHOD: our clinical and experimental study had a sample of 101 individuals, who matched inclusion criteria: to have an air/bone gap higher than 10 dB in the frequencies of 2,000; 3,000 and 4,000 Hz. All of them had their bone conduction threshold measured in two conditions: open ear canal and closed ear canal.RESULTS: we found that major differences between the two conditions evaluated occurred at the 4,000 Hz; data analysis showed significant difference in the extension for the air/bone gap; analysis of the number of cases of mixed hearing loss that changed to sensorineural was significant too.CONCLUSION: These studies concluded that when the MAE is occluded, the acoustic radiation phenomenon is controlled or avoided, enabling bone measures at the frequencies of 3,000 and 4,000Hz to be more accurate.",Excluded
2547,"Central nervous system burkitt variant post-transplant lymphopro life rative disorder (PTLD) Learning Objective #1: Recognize that PTLD as part of the differential when post transplant individuals present with unexplained pain, fever, or organ dysfunction. Learning Objective #2: Burkitt Lymphoma subtype as well as CNS involvement represent more aggressive manifestations of PTLD and should be managed more aggressively. CASE: 72 year-old man with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy status post living donor renal transplant on tacro-limus presents with headache, diplopia, and blurry vision found to have CNIII palsy on neurologic examination. Facial CT and Gadolinium enhanced Brain MRI showed complete bilateral maxillary sinus opacification and leptomeningeal enhancement. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, but given continuous headache and concern for meningitis a lumbar puncture was performed. CSF studies showed atypical lymphocytes of predominantly monoclonal B cells. CSF FISH showed rearrangement of c-myc oncogene negative for rearrangement of bcl6 or bcl2. Serum LDH was elevated and peripheral EBV PCR was positive. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy. Further CT imaging revealed thickening of the small bowel and mesenteric lymph-adenopathy. Patient was started on dexamethasone, intrathecal metho-trexate, and R-Hyper CVAD with interval regression of abdominal LAD, mass, improvement in ptosis, and decrease in LDH. IMPACT: The case represents an uncommon manifestation of an rare variant of disease that should warrant a different approach to diagnosis and treatment. DISCUSSION: PTLD is a well recognized, heterogenous group of disorders. The mechanism of PTLD involves EBV-induced B cell proliferation and antigen mediated T cell activation which upregulate pro-growth factors such as c-Myc. The result of which ranges from early mononucleosis-like illness, polyclonal lymphoid infiltrates, to lymphomas. Therapy involves immune reconstitution, local surgical excision, corticosteroids, antiviral agents, radiation and chemotherapy. Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) is a distinct form of PTLD. BL is an aggressive, mature B cell lymphoma composed of a monomorphic population of lymphoid cells with high mitotic and proliferation rates. Monoclonality is shown as isolated c-myc rearrangement as opposed to rear-rangements in c-myc, bcl6, and bcl2 seen in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the most common form of PTLD. BL represents a distinct monomorphic PTLD and should be managed more aggressively with lymphoma specific chemotherapy rather than simply decreasing immunosuppression. CNS involvement of PTLD is rare, reportedly in 7-15% of all PTLD, when present is predictive of inferior survival. Compared to non-PCNS PTLD, primary CNS PTLD has a higher incidence of monomorphic EBV related disease, and late involvement with poor survival. Prior kidney transplant were also more frequent in primary CNS PTLD compared to other forms of PTLD. As a parallel, in systemic non hodgkins lymphoma, renal localization is also associated with high rates of CNS involvement.",Excluded
3012,"Resident microglia, and not peripheral macrophages, are the main source of brain tumor mononuclear cells Gliomas consist of multiple cell types, including an abundant number of microglia and macrophages, whereby their impact on tumor progression is controversially discussed. To understand their unique functions and consequently manipulate either microglia or macrophages in therapeutic approaches, it is essential to discriminate between both cell populations. Because of the lack of specific markers, generally total body irradiated chimeras with labeled bone marrow cells were used to identify infiltrated cells within the brain. However, total body irradiation (TBI) affects the blood-brain barrier integrity, which in turn potentially facilitates immune cell infiltration. In this study, changes on the blood-brain barrier were avoided using head-protected irradiation (HPI). Head protection and total body irradiated chimeras exhibited similar reconstitution levels of the myeloid cell lineage in the blood, enabling the comparable analyses of brain infiltrates. We demonstrate that the HPI model impeded a massive unspecific influx of donor-derived myeloid cells into naive as well as tumor-bearing brains. Moreover, experimental artifacts such as an enlarged distribution of infiltrated cells and fourfold increased tumor volumes are prevented in head-protected chimeras. In addition, our data evidenced for the first time that microglia are able to up-regulate CD45 and represent an inherent part of the CD45(high) population in the tumor context. All in all, HPI allowed for the unequivocal distinction between microglia and macrophages without alterations of tumor biology and consequently permits a detailed and realistic description of the myeloid cell composition in gliomas.",Excluded
2917,"Bnct combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas INTRODUCTION: Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control. We have often treated RMGs using tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN, we herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT, and evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. METHOD(S): Two cohorts were included. The first and second cohorts were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, and between August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. They were followed by successive BV treatments. The first cohort was composed of 7 patients with RMGs (4 grade 4 and 3 grade 3 cases). The second cohort was composed of 6 patients with RMGs (5 grade 4 and 1 grade 3 cases). They were followed-up to April 2018. RESULT(S): Median OS and PFS after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively in the 1st cohort. Those in the second cohort were not reached. The OS data was compared with RPA classification for RMG as advocated by Carson et al. in a 2007 article in JCO. In both cohorts no symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred if BV could be continued. CTCAE grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Totally 11cases' OS in both cohorts were compared using JCO's RPA classification. Nine out of 11 cases showed longer OS in comparison with corresponding JCO's RPA classes. CONCLUSION(S): BNCT followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.",Excluded

3553,"Extremely low frequency magnetic field induced changes in motor behaviour of gerbils submitted to global cerebral ischemia The purpose of this study was to evaluate behavioural effects of an extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) in 3-month-old Mongolian gerbils submitted to global cerebral ischemia. After 10-min occlusion of both common carotid arteries, the gerbils were placed in the vicinity of an electromagnet and continuously exposed to ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) for 7 days. Their behaviour (locomotion, stereotypy, rotations, and immobility) was monitored on days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 after reperfusion for 60min in the open field. It was shown that the 10-min global cerebral ischemia per se induced a significant motor activity increase (locomotion, stereotypy and rotations), and consequently immobility decrease until day 4 after reperfusion, compared to control gerbils. Exposure to ELF-MF inhibited development of ischemia-induced motor hyperactivity during the whole period of registration, but significantly in the first 2 days after reperfusion, when the postischemic hyperactivity was most evident. Motor activity of these gerbils was still significantly increased compared to control ones, but only on day 1 after reperfusion. Our results revealed that the applied ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) decreased motor hyperactivity induced by the 10-min global cerebral ischemia, via modulation of the processes that underlie this behavioural response.",Excluded
2954,"Radiation therapy for the treatment of tumours in small companion animals Radiation is becoming widely available to treat tumours in veterinary patients. Orthovoltage machines capable of delivering low energy external beam radiation are less versatile than linear accelerators and cobalt-60 machines that deliver megavoltage radiation. In addition, electron beam capabilities that are available with some linear accelerators allow more targeted treatment in smaller patients. Acute effects of radiation are to be expected, but in nearly all cases such side effects resolve without limiting protocols. In contrast, late effects of radiation are dose limiting and are more likely with higher doses per treatment fraction. Protocols that use smaller doses per fraction have a lower risk of late effects thereby allowing higher total doses to be delivered which leads to higher tumour control rates. It is possible to provide long-term tumour control in cats and dogs using radiation therapy, particularly for mast cell tumours, soft tissue sarcomas, oral tumours and brain tumours in dogs and soft tissue sarcomas and skin tumours in cats. Individualization of treatments for tumours based on tumour staging and proliferative fraction should be considered, rather than making blanket assumptions about the behaviour of histologically determined tumour types. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

3045,"The white 'matter' in obsessive compulsive disorder: Effect of pharmacological treatment and symptom dimensions models Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is highly heterogeneous in its manifestations, both across patients and within the same patient over time. The disorder is probably best described by a multidimensional model involving several symptom dimensions, whose precise number and phenotypes are debated. This heterogeneity partly explains, beyond methodological discrepancies, the inconsistency of results in current brain imaging research in the disorder, particularly in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Purpose(s): We aimed at investigating white matter (WM) alterations associated with OCD, controlling for the impact of variables known to affect WM structure, and specifically for the effect of current and lifetime pharmacological treatment. Then, we tested two different symptom dimensions models [1,2] within OCD patients, analysing theirWMcorrelates, for both prevailing current symptom dimension and symptom dimension at onset. Method(s): We compared 58 adult pure-OCD patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC), with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics on diffusion tensor images, using TFCE correction (p = 0.05). With respect to symptom dimensions, separate analyses were carried on the sole OCD sample. The diffusion measures Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were used as parameters of WM organisation. Result(s): The observed differences between OCD patients and HC were totally carried by the effect of previous and current medications. No differences were in fact observed between drugna ive patients and HC. Current medication was associated with a widespread decrease of FA and increase of RD throughout the whole brain. Lifetime treatment was associated with a decrease in FA in the tracts surrounding the thalami, site of major neurotransmitter alteration in OCD. In the analysis of symptom dimensions, only a finer-grained five-factors model [2] allowed for the identification of specific neural correlates. Patients having current Symmetry/Perfectionism dimension show a reduction in RD and MD in the body of corpus callosum and in left higher-order visual association tracts, including: left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and/or inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, patients having Doubt/Checking dimension at onset show a widespread reduction of AD, encompassing corpus callosum, and bilaterally the thalamic radiations, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Finally, patients having Rituals/Superstition dimension at onset show an increase in FA in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits: genu of corpus callosum, bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations and left external capsule. Conclusion(s): Present results confirm the effect of medications on WM in OCD [3], showing a large effect of current treatment on myelination and a site-specific, disorder-specific, effect of medications on brain systems. Furthermore, our findings provide support to a multidimensional model of OCD, and indicate that the distinction of clinically homogeneous dimensions is essential for the identification of reliable neural correlates. Finally, we evidence, to our knowledge for the first time, that onset symptom dimensions are associated with enduring alterations of WM structure. Onset symptom dimensions may reflect underlying endophenotypes, and our results suggest their relevance for future investigations on OCD neuroanatomy and aetiopathology.",Excluded

Both groups performed significantly poorer than the non-irradiated controls.

2498,"Abciximab (ReoPro) Dosing Strategy for the Management of Acute Intraprocedural Thromboembolic Complications during Pipeline Flow Diversion Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms Background: Flow diversion with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) is an effective neuro-endovascular method and increasingly accepted for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Acute in situ thrombosis is a known complication of PED procedures. There is limited experience in the flow diversion literature on the use of abciximab (ReoPro) for the management of acute thrombus formation in PED cases. Method(s): Data were collected retrospectively on patients who received intra-arterial (IA) ReoPro with or without subsequent intravenous (IV) infusion during PED flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Result(s): A total of 30 cases in patients with a mean age of 56.7 years (range 36-84) and a mean aneurysm size of 8.6 mm (range 2-25) were identified to have intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. IA ReoPro was administered in all cases, with 20 cases receiving increments of 5-mg boluses and 10 cases receiving a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing). Complete or partial recanalization was achieved in 100% of the cases. IV ReoPro infusion at 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 h was administered postprocedurally in 22 cases with a residual thrombus. Postprocedurally, 18 patients were transitioned from clopidogrel (Plavix) to prasugrel (Effient). The majority of the cases (23/30; 77%) were discharged home. Periprocedural intracranial hemorrhage was noted in 2 cases (7%) and radiographic infarct was noted in 4 cases (13%), with an overall mortality of 0% at the time of initial discharge. Clinical follow-up was available for 28/30 patients. The average duration of follow-up was 11.7 months, at which time 23/28 (82%) of the patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0. Conclusion(s): IA ReoPro administration is an effective and safe rescue strategy for the management of acute intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. Using a dosing strategy of either 5-mg increments or a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing) can provide high rates of recanalization with low rates of hemorrhagic complications and long-term morbidity.

Here we report the results of morphological and morphometric analyses of a human glioblastoma cell line, CGNH-89, after ionizing radiation to characterize the effect of a carbon-beam on glioblastoma cells. Using CGNH-89 cells exposed to 0-10 Gy of X-ray (140 kVp) or carbon-ions (18.3 MeV/nucleon, LET = 108 keV/mum), we performed conventional histology and immunocytochemistry with MIB-1 antibody, transmission electron microscopy, and computer-assisted, nuclear size measurements. CGNH-89 cells with a G to A transition in codon 280 in exon 8 of the TP53 gene had nuclei with pleomorphism, marked nuclear atypia and brisk mitotic activity. After carbon-ion and X-ray exposure, living cells showed decreased cell number, nuclear condensation, increased atypical mitotic figures, and a tendency of cytoplasmic enlargement at the level of light microscopy. The deviation of the nuclear area size increased during 48 h after irradiation, while the small cell fraction increased in 336 h. In glioblastoma cells of the control, 5 Gy carbon-beam, and 10 Gy carbon-beam, and MIB-1 labeling index decreased in 24 h (12%, 11%, 7%, respectively) but increased in 48 h (10%, 20%, 21%, respectively). Ultrastructurally, cellular enlargement seemed to depend on vacuolation, swelling of mitochondria, and increase of cellular organelles, such as the cytoskeleton and secondary lysosome. We could not observe apoptotic bodies in the CGNH-89 cells under any conditions. We conclude that carbon-ion irradiation induced cell death and senescence in a glioblastoma cell line with mutant TP53.

3582,"Use of 2-deoxy-D[1-11C]glucose for the determination of local cerebral glucose metabolism in humans: variation within and between subjects The deoxyglucose technique for the measurement of local cerebral glucose metabolism (LCMRgl) has been widely applied in animals utilizing 14C-deoxyglucose and in humans employing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Repeat studies in humans over a relatively brief period of time have not been possible because of the 110-min half-life of fluorine-18. With the synthesis of 11C-deoxyglucose it has now become possible to utilize this short-lived (20 min) tracer for the measurement of LCMRgl and to determine its variability within subjects over a 2-h period. The kinetic rate constants for 11C-deoxyglucose were determined for gray and white matter and found to be very similar to those for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, suggesting that these two analogues of glucose have similar affinities for the facilitated transport system and are similar substrates for hexokinase in the brain. The coefficient of variation of repeated measurements of LCMRgl in a series of six normal subjects was 5.5% to 8.7% for various gray matter structures and 9.7% and 14.0% for white matter structures. The pattern of cerebral metabolic rates is relatively constant in a given individual when the conditions of the study are unchanged. The ability to make repeat measurements in the same subject reduces the variance due to between-subject differences, allowing smaller changes in LCMRgl to be detected with confidence.",Excluded

3323,"Exploring the cost-effectiveness of thoracic radiation therapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): The recently reported Chest Radiotherapy Extensive Stage Trial (CREST) showed that administering thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) after a response to first-line chemotherapy improves 2-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival, without an increase in adverse events, in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding TRT to chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ESSCLC patients. Materials/Methods: Using a partitioned survival model, a cost-utility analysis was performed to compare strategies of TRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions via 3-D conformal RT) plus PCI versus PCI alone. The time horizon was limited to 24 months, the median follow-up of CREST. OS was partitioned into three mutually exclusive health states: alive with no progression (ANP), alive with progression (AWP), and dead. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was based on the empirical survival functions reported in CREST. Institutional treatment costs from a payer perspective were used while utilities were derived from the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed plausible ranges of uncertainty in key variables including costs, utilities, and the TRT survival benefit. Result(s): In the base-case analysis, adding TRT resulted in a $4,066 cost increase and a gain of 0.06 QALYs (0.09 LYs), yielding an ICER of $66,901/QALY ($46,568/LY). Extending the time horizon to 30 months, assuming: (1), a persistent survival benefit and (2), a declining benefit to a hazard ratio of 1, resulted in ICERs of $93,204 and $111,916/QALY respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ICER to be most sensitive to variations in ANP and AWP health state costs. The ICER was moderately sensitive to variations in TRT costs and the utility for the ANP state, but less sensitive to changes in the utility for the AWP state. Conclusion(s): Adding TRT to chemotherapy in ES-SCLC patients was found to be cost effective using commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, with an ICER lower than those of many systemic treatments for metastatic disease. Since the incremental survival benefit of TRT beyond 24 months is small, its cost-effectiveness is expected to decrease if costs remain constant.",Excluded
3184,"Impact of therapy and disease-related symptoms on health-related quality of life in patients with follicular lymphoma: results of the population-based PHAROS-registry OBJECTIVES: The increasing number of longer living patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and serious side effects of treatment urged us to study the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and persistent (treatment-related) symptoms in unselected patients after different treatment modalities and compare HRQoL of patients with a normative population.METHODS: The population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry was used to select patients diagnosed with FL during 2004-2010. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was completed twice, with a 1-yr interval. This questionnaire was also completed by an age- and sex-matched normative population (N = 580). Detailed data on treatment were extracted from the cancer registry and Population-based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies (PHAROS).RESULTS: Of the 181 patients who were invited, 148 responded (82%, T1). Patients treated with immunochemotherapy reported clinically relevant higher mean fatigue scores than those who underwent radiotherapy (P = 0.02). No differences were observed on the other HRQoL scales between treatment groups. Mean HRQoL scores were worse for FL patients treated with immunochemotherapy compared with a normative population (P < 0.01). A quarter to 50% of patients persistently reported to be slowed down, lethargic, or persistently worried about future health or was limited in social activities. Subsequently, patients reporting these symptoms/worries had a lower global health status/HRQoL.CONCLUSION: Alertness for persistent symptoms that occur during and after treatment of FL patients is needed and may help to avoid lasting negative influence on their HRQoL.",Excluded
2540,"Preclinical radiotherapy at the Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline: instrumentation, dosimetry and a small-animal feasibility study Therapeutic applications of synchrotron X-rays such as microbeam (MRT) and minibeam (MBRT) radiation therapy promise significant advantages over conventional clinical techniques for some diseases if successfully transferred to clinical practice. Preclinical studies show clear evidence that a number of normal tissues in animal models display a tolerance to much higher doses from MRT compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, a wide spread in the parameters studied makes it difficult to make any conclusions about the associated tumour control or normal tissue complication probabilities. To facilitate more systematic and reproducible preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies, a dedicated preclinical station including small-animal irradiation stage was designed and installed at the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron. The stage was characterized in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the vertical scanning speed, as this is the key variable in dose delivery. The measured speed was found to be within 1% of the nominal speed for the range of speeds measured by an interferometer. Furthermore, dose measurements confirm the expected relationship between speed and dose and show that the measured dose is independent of the scan direction. Important dosimetric parameters such as peak dose, valley dose, the collimator output factor and peak-to-valley dose ratio are presented for 5 mm x 5 mm, 10 mm x 10 mm and 20 mm x 20 mm field sizes. Finally, a feasibility study on three glioma-bearing rats was performed. MRT and MBRT doses were prescribed to achieve an average dose of 65 Gy in the target, and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up was performed at various time points after irradiation to follow the tumour volume. Although it is impossible to draw conclusions on the different treatments with such a small number of animals, the feasibility of end-to-end preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies using the IMBL preclinical stage is demonstrated.",Excluded
2670,"Which prognostic index is most appropriate in the setting of delayed stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases? Objectives: To determine if five commonly used prognostic indices (PIs) - recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), Score Index for Radiosurgery (SIR), Basic Score for Brain Metastases (BSBM), graded prognostic assessment (GPA), and the diagnosis-specific GPA - are valid following delay between diagnosis and treatment of brain metastases. Method(s): In a single-institutional cohort, records of patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) more than 30 days from diagnosis of brain metastases were collected, and five PI scores were calculated for each patient. For each PI, three score-based groupings were made to examine survival differences by means of adjusted log-rank analysis and area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): Of 121 patients with sufficient PI information, 72 underwent SRS more than 30 days after diagnosis. Median age and Karnofsky performance status were 60 years and 80, respectively. Forty-three (60%) patients had lung primaries. Prior to SRS, 38 (52.8%) and 12 (16.7%) patients underwent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery, respectively. Two (2.8%) patients underwent both WBRT and surgery prior to SRS. A median of two lesions were treated per SRS course. Median survival of the cohort was 9.0 months. Using adjusted log-rank analysis for pairwise comparison, BSBM and GPA showed significance between two out of the three prognostic groups, while the other scores showed either one or no significant differences on comparison. AUC demonstrated good applicability for BSBM, RPA, and GPA, although SIR was statistically less prognostic than the other PIs. Conclusion(s): The PIs analyzed in this study were applicable in the setting of delayed SRS. Although these data are hypothesis generating, they serve to encourage further analyses to validate a PI that is most optimal for these patients.

3250,"Target size analysis of opioid receptors. No difference between receptor types, but discrimination between two receptor states Target size analysis of opioid receptor is complicated by the presence of multi-exponential inactivation curves. Irradiation of intact frozen tissue proved essential to eliminate such artifacts, due to indirect irradiation effects. Upon irradiation condition, opioid binding activity was inactivated in a single mono-exponential manner. Identical inactivation curves were obtained for mu, delta and kappa binding activities in brain membranes from rat, guinea-pig and frog and in NG 108-15 cells: the molecular mass obtained was 98 +/- 2 kDa. However, when opioid binding was assayed in the presence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP, the molecular mass was found to be only 56 +/- 4.4 kDa. We suggest that the opioid recognition site comprises a unit of 56 kDa and that in the absence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP an additional membrane component of 40-44 kDa is necessary for high-affinity opioid binding.",Excluded
2767,"Current practices and future directions of therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma: survival benefit and indication of BNCT Since 1998, we are performing clinical studies on treatment of GBM using conventional fractionated photon radiation therapy (CRT), proton beam therapy (PBT) or boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). We investigated whether these radiation modalities improves the survival of patients with GBM. Sixty-eight cases of newly diagnosed GBM have been treated in our institution. After surgery, radiation therapy was performed using CRT with a dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy (n=36), hyperfractionated PBT concomitant with fractionated photon irradiation with a total dose of 96.6 Gy (n=17), or a single fraction of BNCT (n=15). In PBT, the surrounding volume of 2 cm from main tumor mass and the volume of perifocal edema were irradiated at dose of 75.6 and 60 Gy, respectively. The median OS time of the case series of BNCT for GBM has been reported as 13-20.7 M. In this study, the median OS and median time to MR change (TTM) for all patients were 25.7 and 11.9 M, respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 85.7% and 45.5%, respectively. On the other hand, in the patients who underwent CRT and ACNU-based chemotherapy, OS and 2-year survival rate were 14.2M and 17.9%, respectively. In the patients who underwent high-dose PBT, OS and 2-year survival rate were 21.3M and 38.5%, respectively. The present small case series of selected patients showed survival benefit after BNCT. The comparison using previously reported prognostic factor-based classifications suggest that outcome of BNCT in terms of survival appeared to have non-inferiority compared to the standard therapy. With respect to the case series as a high-dose radiation trial, the outcome (OS: 9.5-25 M) of previously reported may still be comparable to that of BNCT. Randomized trials of comparably selected patients are required to demonstrate conclusively that prolonged survival is a result of this tumor-selective radiotherapy.",Excluded
3252,"Delayed central nervous system irradiation effects in rats--part 2: aggravation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) irradiation has detrimental effects which become evident within hours to few days and after a long latency of months and years. However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE. The severity of the disease may be a consequence of the effect of irradiation on the CNS vascular bed and impaired blood-brain barrier.",Included
3173,"Myeloid and lymphoid contribution to non-haematopoietic lineages through irradiation-induced heterotypic cell fusion Recent studies have suggested that regeneration of non-haematopoietic cell lineages can occur through heterotypic cell fusion with haematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. Here we show that lymphocytes also form heterotypic-fusion hybrids with cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, hepatocytes and Purkinje neurons. However, through lineage fate-mapping we demonstrate that such in vivo fusion of lymphoid and myeloid blood cells does not occur to an appreciable extent in steady-state adult tissues or during normal development. Rather, fusion of blood cells with different non-haematopoietic cell types is induced by organ-specific injuries or whole-body irradiation, which has been used in previous studies to condition recipients of bone marrow transplants. Our findings demonstrate that blood cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages contribute to various non-haematopoietic tissues by forming rare fusion hybrids, but almost exclusively in response to injuries or inflammation.",Excluded
2813,"The effect of sequential irradiation with X-rays and fast neutrons on the survival of V79 Chinese hamster cells V79 Chinese hamster cells have been exposed to X-rays or fast neurons or to the two radiations given sequentially. Cells exposed to a priming dose of X-rays and then exposed immediately to a series of neutron doses regard the X-ray dose as equivalent to a neutron dose giving the same surviving fraction (iso-effective). If the cells are exposed to a neutron dose followed by X-rays the resulting survival is higher than would be obtained if the primary dose had been an iso-effective X-ray dose. However, it is lower than would be expected if the two radiations acted independently. The results imply that there is interaction between the damage caused by X-rays and fast neurons. If the two radiations are given 3 hours apart they act independently.",Included

3237,"Autophagy in normal tissues of camel (Camelus dromedarius) with focus on immunoexpression of LC3 and LC3B Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular pathway for degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic protein aggregates and entire organelles. The autophagic pathway is stimulated by nutrient starvation, which prompted us to study the desert camel. Various organs of the camel undergo ecological and physiological stress due to food and water deprivation, dehydration and long exposure to solar radiation. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of specific biomarkers of autophagy under normal conditions as a baseline for later work on stressed individuals. The autophagy-specific biomarkers, microtubule-associated protein1 light chain 3 (LC3), and its cleaved variant, LC3B, were strongly expressed in the cytosol of all tissues examined. The cytosolic immunoreactivity of LC3 was relatively weak, diffuse and vacuolar, while that of LC3B was stronger, punctate and at lower levels. LC3 appears to be associated with the autophagosomal membranes, either free or lysosome-bounded. LC3B is specific for the autophagosome-lysosome complexes and their degraded, granular contents. Autophagy was strongly expressed in CNS neurons and intestinal neural elements, which suggests a protective function for the nervous system. Autophagic markers also were seen in deformed immune-competent cells with fragmented nuclei in lymph nodes, spleen and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which suggests a ""suicidal"" activity of eliminating unneeded cells. Autophagy, as measured by LC3 and LC3B expression, may participate in a general regulatory mechanism in tissues of the desert camel.",Excluded
3573,"Dosimetric, radiobiological and secondary cancer risk evaluation in head-and-neck three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and volumetric modulated arc therapy: A phantom study This analysis estimated secondary cancer risks after volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and compared those risks to the risks associated with other modalities of head-and-neck (H&N) radiotherapy. Images of H&N anthropomorphic phantom were acquired with a computed tomography scanner and exported via digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standards to a treatment planning system. Treatment plans were performed using a VMAT dual-arc technique, a nine-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique, and a four-field three-dimensional conformal therapy (3DCRT) technique. The prescription dose was 66.0 Gy for all three techniques, but to accommodate the range of dosimeter responses, we delivered a single dose of 6.60 Gy to the isocenter. The lifetime risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 116. VMAT delivered the lowest maximum doses to esophagus (23 Gy), and normal brain (40 Gy). In comparison, maximum doses for 3DCRT were 74% and 40%, higher than those for VMAT for the esophagus, and normal brain, respectively. The normal tissue complication probability and equivalent uniform dose for the brain (2.1%, 0.9%, 0.8% and 3.8 Gy, 2.6 Gy, 2.3 Gy) and esophagus (4.2%, 0.7%, 0.4% and 3.7 Gy, 2.2 Gy, 1.8 Gy) were calculated for the 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT respectively. Fractional esophagus OAR volumes receiving more than 20 Gy were 3.6% for VMAT, 23.6% for IMRT, and 100% for 3DCRT. The calculations for mean doses, NTCP, EUD and OAR volumes suggest that the risk of secondary cancer induction after VMAT is lower than after IMRT and 3DCRT.

3414,"Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for recurrent, residual, or untreated skull-base meningiomas: preliminary clinical experience OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for complex-shaped benign meningiomas of the skull base and report clinical experience.METHODS: Twenty patients with benign skull-base meningiomas WHO degrees I (histopathologically proven in 16/20) were treated with IMRT between June 1998 and August 1999. Each tumor was complex in shape and adherent to, or encompassed, organs at risk (cranial nerves, optic apparatus, and brainstem). All patients, immobilized in a customized head mask integrated into a stereotactic system, were planned on an inverse treatment planning system using 5 or 7 coplanar, equidistant beams and 5 intensity steps. Each treatment plan was verified extensively before treatment. Follow-up with MRI and clinical examination was performed at 6 and 18 weeks and every 6 months thereafter.RESULTS: Target volumes ranged from 27 to 278 cc (median: 108 cc). Mean dose in 32 fractions ranged between 55.8 and 58.2 Gy. At median follow-up of 36 months (range: 31-43 months), pre-existing neurologic symptoms improved in 12/20 (60%), remained stable in 7/20 (35%), and worsened in 1 (5%) patient. Radiographic follow-up revealed significant tumor shrinkage 6 weeks post-IMRT in 2 patients and partial remission in 3 more patients at 9-17 months; other tumor volumes remained stable. There was no radiation-induced peritumoral edema, increase in tumor size, or new onset of neurologic deficits. Transient acute treatment side effects included nausea and vomiting and single occurrences of conjunctivitis/increased tearing and serous tympanitis.CONCLUSION: IMRT in the treatment of central nervous system meningiomas is feasible and safe, offering highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped skull-base tumors while sparing adjacent critical structures. If the tumor remissions seen here are found in the ongoing treatments, IMRT may be considered the treatment of choice for inoperable or subtotally resected meningiomas and for otherwise difficult-to-treat, complex-shaped tumors of the central nervous system adjacent to critical structures, with the potential of dose escalation for malignant tumors.",Excluded

In the present study, we tested the effects of five different omega-conotoxins, CVID, CVIB, MVIIA, MVIIC and GVIA, on excitatory synaptic transmission between primary afferents and dorsal horn superficial lamina neurons of rat spinal cord. The N-type VGCC antagonists CVID (200nM) and MVIIA (500nM) completely and irreversibly inhibited excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the dorsal horn superficial lamina. The N- and P/Q-type VGCC antagonist CVIB (200nM) reversibly reduced evoked EPSC amplitude an average of 34+/-8%, whereas MVIIC (200nM) had no effect on excitatory synaptic transmission. In neurons receiving polysynaptic input, CVIB reduced both the EPSC amplitude and the ""success rate"" calculated as the relative number of primary afferent stimulations that resulted in postsynaptic responses. These results indicate that (i) the analgesic action of omega-conotoxins that antagonise N-type VGCCs may be attributed to inhibition of neurotransmission between primary afferents and superficial dorsal horn neurons, (ii) nociceptive synaptic transmission between primary afferents and superficial lamina neurons is mediated predominantly by N-type VGCCs, and (iii) in contrast to the irreversible inhibition by CVID, MVIIA and GVIA, the inhibition of excitatory monosynaptic transmission by CVIB is reversible.",Excluded
2580,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), confined to the brain, eyes, spinal cord or leptomeninges without systemic involvement. Overall prognosis, diagnosis and management of PCNSL differ from other types of NHL. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment are vital to improving clinical outcomes. PCNSL is responsive to radiation therapy, however whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) inadequately controls the disease when used alone and its delayed neurotoxicity causes neurocognitive impairment, especially in elderly patients. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based induction chemotherapy with or without autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or reduced-dose WBRT leads to durable disease control and less neurotoxicity. The optimal treatment has yet to be defined, however HD-MTX-based induction chemotherapy is considered standard for newly diagnosed PCNSL. Ongoing randomized trials address the role of rituximab, and of consolidative treatment using ASCT or reduced-dose WBRT. Despite high tumor response rates to initial treatment, many patients have relapsing disease with very poor prognosis. The optimal treatment for refractory or relapsed PCNSL is poorly defined. The choice of salvage treatment depends on age, previous treatment and response, performance status and comorbidities at the time of relapse.

2726,"Sustained ocular venous fluid shift during spaceflight may contribute to optic disc edema Purpose : The Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) is characterized by the development of optic disc edema, chorioretinal folds, globe flattening, and/or hyperopic shifts in astronauts during 6-month missions on the International Space Station (ISS). We hypothesize that a weightlessness-induced chronic headward fluid shift within the venous system contributes to these ocular changes. Methods : Astronauts (n=10) were studied before flight (seated and supine posture) and ~150 days into a 6-month mission on the ISS. Ocular and vascular measures included optical coherence tomography (OCT; Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering) assessments of sub-macular choroid thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness (TRT; segmented from Bruch's membrane to the internal limiting membrane); ultrasound-derived internal jugular vein (IJV) cross-sectional area (GE VividQ) and non-invasive IJV pressure (Veinpress); and intraocular pressure (IOP; iCare pro pre-flight and TonoPen in-flight). Repeatedmeasures ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was used to determine the mean change between conditions; data are presented as group mean +/- standard deviation. Results : The mean IJV area increased from 9 +/- 6 mm<sup>2</sup> in the seated position to 83 +/- 27 mm<sup>2</sup> in the supine position on Earth and to 64 +/- 31 mm<sup>2</sup> during spaceflight (P<.001). Similarly, mean IJV pressure increased from 4.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg in the seated position to 16.6 +/- 5.6 mmHg in the supine position on Earth and to 14.4 +/- 5.3 mmHg in-flight (P<.001). No significant changes in sub-macular choroid thickness or TRT were detected during the acute preflight posture change, however after 150 days of weightlessness, choroid thickness increased by 50 +/- 37 mum (P<.05) and TRT increased by 26 +/- 32 mum (P=.05) relative to preflight seated values. IOP remained within a normal range in weightlessness, averaging 15.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg after 150 days of spaceflight, compared to 14.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg and 15 +/- 1.1 mmHg pre-flight in the seated and supine positions, respectively. Conclusions : Although a transient posture-induced venous fluid shift has no effect on choroidal or retinal thickness, a sustained, unrelenting cephalad fluid shift during spaceflight results in increased choroidal and retinal thickness. These data suggest that altered venous hemodynamics during spaceflight may contribute to SANS.",Excluded

The surgical patients were also subdivided into two groups and compared. The neuropsychological measures were standardized psychological tests designed to assess aspects of attention, memory and executive function.PATIENTS: The patients were those who had been treated with transfrontal surgery (n = 23), transsphenoidal surgery (n = 23) and medication only (n = 23). The groups did not differ with respect to age, education or premorbid ability level as assessed by the National Adult Reading Test. All participants were free of known sources of cognitive impairment other than pituitary tumour.RESULTS: Comparison of the four groups revealed that nearly half of the transfrontal, one-third of the transsphenoidal and one-quarter of the non-surgical group had three or more neuropsychological tests scores below the 10th percentile compared to less than 5% of the controls. Impairments in memory and executive function were found in both surgical groups. The non-surgical patients appeared to have problems only on tasks requiring high levels of cognitive processing. Differences were found between the two surgical groups with respect to the severity of the cognitive impairment, the transfrontal patients having more severe impairment than the transsphenoidal. No significant negative effects on cognitive functioning were associated with radiotherapy; however, transfrontal surgery patients who had not been treated with radiotherapy were found to be more impaired than other patients. This was thought to be related to radical surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with treated pituitary tumour suffer significant cognitive impairment. The severity and nature of impairment differs between treatment groups, although the cause of this could not be addressed by this study.

3623,"Novel free-hand T1 pedicle screw method: Review of 44 consecutive cases SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Multilevel posterior cervical instrumented fusions are becoming more prevalent in current practice. Biomechanical characteristics of the cervicothoracic junction may necessitate extending the construct to upper thoracic segments. However, fixation in upper thoracic spine can be technically demanding owing to transitional anatomy while suboptimal placement facilitates vascular and neurologic complications. Thoracic instrumentation methods include free-hand, fluoroscopic guidance, and CT-based image guidance. However, fluoroscopy of upper thoracic spine is challenging secondary to vertebral geometry and patient positioning, while image-guided systems present substantial financial commitment and are not readily available at most centers. Additionally, imaging modalities increase radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon while potentially lengthening surgical time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 44 consecutive patients undergoing a cervicothoracic fusion by a single surgeon using the novel free-hand T1 pedicle screw technique between June 2009 and November 2012. A starting point medial and cephalad to classic entry as well as new trajectory were utilized. No imaging modalities were employed during screw insertion. Postoperative CT scans were obtained on day 1. Screw accuracy was independently evaluated according to the Heary classification.RESULTS: In total, 87 pedicle screws placed were at T1. Grade 1 placement occurred in 72 (82.8%) screws, Grade 2 in 4 (4.6%) screws and Grade 3 in 9 (10.3%) screws. All Grade 2 and 3 breaches were <2 mm except one Grade 3 screw breaching 2-4 mm laterally. Only two screws (2.3%) were noted to be Grade 4, both breaching medially by less than 2 mm. No new neurological deficits or returns to operating room took place postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: This modification of the traditional starting point and trajectory at T1 is safe and effective. It attenuates additional bone removal or imaging modalities while maintaining a high rate of successful screw placement compared to historical controls.",Excluded
3505,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included
2775,"Gamma Knife surgery for adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing pituitary adenomas after bilateral adrenalectomy OBJECT: Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas may require a bilateral adrenalectomy to treat their Cushing's disease. Approximately one third of these patients, however, will experience progressive enlargement of the residual pituitary adenoma, develop hyperpigmentation, and have an elevated level of serum ACTH. These patients with Nelson's syndrome can be treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS).METHODS: The prospectively collected University of Virginia Gamma Knife database of patients with pituitary adenomas was reviewed to identify all individuals with Nelson's syndrome who were treated with GKS. Twenty-three patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow up were identified in the database. These patients were assessed for tumor control (that is, lack of tumor growth over time) with neuroimaging studies (median follow-up duration 22 months) and for biochemical normalization of their ACTH levels (median follow-up duration 50 months). Neuroimaging follow-up studies were available for 22 patients, and endocrine follow up was available for 15 patients in whom elevation of ACTH levels was documented prior to GKS. In the 22 patients in whom neuroimaging follow-up studies were available, 12 had a decrease in tumor size, eight had no tumor growth, and two had an increase in tumor volume. Ten of 15 patients with elevated ACTH levels prior to GKS showed a decrease in their ACTH levels at last follow up; three of these 10 patients achieved normal ACTH levels (< 50 pg/ml) and the other five patients with initially elevated values had an increase in ACTH levels. Ten patients were thoroughly evaluated for post-GKS pituitary function; four were found to have new pituitary hormone deficiency and six did not have hypopituitarism after GKS. One patient suffered a permanent third cranial nerve palsy and four patients are now deceased.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery may control the residual pituitary adenoma and decrease ACTH levels in patients with Nelson's syndrome. Delayed hypopituitarism or cranial nerve palsies can occur after GKS. Patients with Nelson's syndrome require continued multidisciplinary follow-up care. Given the difficulties associated with management of Nelson's syndrome, even the modest results of GKS may be helpful for a number of patients.",Excluded
2740,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded
2586,"Creation of endothelial-targeted adenoviral vectors for genetic engineering of the metastatic tumor microenvironment The endothelium is an attractive gene therapy target for metastatic cancer, providing access to systemic tumors. Previous work has focused on either viral entry/attachment (transductional targeting), or cell type specific enhancer promoter vector transgene expression regulation (transcriptional targeting). While previous studies demonstrated endothelial targeting, the tumor wide extent and transgene expression level quantification have been uncertain. Indeed, obtaining robust and stringent tumor expression has been challenging due to: insufficient transduction, focal rather than widespread intratumoral vascular expression, viral particle liver sequestration, and host preformed immunity. We developed a set of adenoviral vectors, containing 3 kb of the human ROBO4 enhancer/promoter, that are expressed at high levels throughout tumor vasculature. We now have three vectors representing four tiers of genetic modification. Transgenes encoding fluorescent proteins allowed us to quantify endothelial expression frequency by image analysis, and expression level using whole tissue Western blotting. Our first vector was Ad5.ROBO4. Compared with Ad5.CMV, Ad5.ROBO4 evidenced complete retargeting from hepatocytes to low-level expression in host organ and tumor endothelial cells. Warfarin-mediated hepatocyte detargeting produced a striking increase in tumor and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial expression, without change in other host organs. Our second vector is Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4. Insertion of a cyclized RGD peptide in the fiber/knob HI loop engages enhanced tumor endothelial transduction via alphav/beta3 and alphav/beta5. Swapping hexon hypervariable regions responsible for Ad Type 5-Factor X binding with corresponding regions from serotype 3 enables marked diminution of hepatocyte sequestration. Use of the ROBO4 enhancer promoter produces high-level pan-intratumoral vascular expression particularly in cancers with markedly elevated VEGF production, such as orthotopic and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, orthotopic colonic liver metastases, and prostate cancer bone, brain, and liver metastases. Most striking, was enhancement of Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4 vector expression within interior tumor regions undergoing hypoxic necrosis; regions notoriously resistant to radiation or chemotherapies. Our third vector contains a polycistronic array, enabling triple transgene expression from a single vector within the tumor vasculature. Thus, we have panel of endothelial-targeted vectors with distinctive vascular tropism for use in cancers metastatic to individual host organs. These vectors enable expression of a palette of transgenes that can manipulate the tumor microenvironment to achieve metastatic growth inhibition alone, or ""staggered"" with chemo- or irradiation therapies.",Excluded
3010,"Glutamate transporters regulate extrasynaptic NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 potassium channels Delayed-rectifier Kv2.1 potassium channels regulate somatodendritic excitability during periods of repetitive, high-frequency activity. Recent evidence suggests that Kv2.1 channel modulation is linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission. Because NMDA-type glutamate receptors are critical regulators of synaptic plasticity, we investigated NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 channels in rodent hippocampus and cortex. Bath application of NMDA potently unclustered and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 and produced a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation of voltage-sensitive potassium currents (I(K)). In contrast, driving synaptic activity in Mg2+-free media to hyperactivate synaptic NMDA receptors had no effect on Kv2.1 channels, and moderate pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure activity in adult mice did not dephosphorylate hippocampal Kv2.1 channels. Selective activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors unclustered and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 channels and produced a hyperpolarizing shift in neuronal I(K). In addition, inhibition of glutamate uptake rapidly activated NMDA receptors and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 channels. These observations demonstrate that regulation of intrinsic neuronal activity by Kv2.1 is coupled to extrasynaptic but not synaptic NMDA receptors. These data support a novel mechanism for glutamate transporters in regulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity through extrasynaptic NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 channels.",Excluded
3616,"Radiation induced cardiovascular disease: An odyssey of bedside-bench-bedside approach The journey to Mars will be an ambitious, yet arduous task as it will entail culmination of all the information we have gathered over many decades. While the mission is of utmost importance, preservation of astronaut's well-being is paramount also. To that end, mitigation of radiation risk especially afflicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of great interest and challenge. Current data from astronauts on low earth orbit and Apollo missions provides insight on the risk of CVD from radiation exposure. However, data is limited given the small cohort size of astronauts who embarked on just nine prolonged missions. Therefore, a cerebral approach to understanding and mitigating risks are essential. This paper discusses the need for a predictive preclinical model to help understand and mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts. We will discuss strengths and limitations of preclinical models and the methods of validating and constructing a model to predict human clinical outcomes. Our bedside-bench-bedside approach focuses on adapting the preclinical model through common investigative tools used between humans and animals. The result will be an optimization of preclinical model to a point of being a surrogate clinical model capable of predicting CVD outcomes in astronauts exposed to radiation.

3196,"Evaluation of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other tremors: Survival of neurons adjacent to the thalamic lesion after gamma thalamotomy Object. The effects of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other kinds of tremor were evaluated. Methods. Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T<inf>2</inf>-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. Conclusions. Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases.",Excluded
3234,"Light affects mitochondria to cause apoptosis to cultured cells: possible relevance to ganglion cell death in certain optic neuropathies Retinal ganglion cell axons within the globe are laden with mitochondria that are unprotected from light (400-760 nm) impinging onto the retina. Light can be absorbed by mitochondrial enzymes such as cytochrome and flavin oxidases causing the generation of reactive oxygen species, and we have suggested this may pose a risk to ganglion cell survival if their energy state is compromised, as may be so in glaucoma or in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Here, we demonstrate that light (400-760 nm) provokes apoptosis in cultured retinal ganglion-5 cells, and that this effect is enhanced in low serum, and attenuated by various antioxidants. Apoptosis is shown to be caspase independent, involving reactive oxygen species generation and the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and apoptosis-inducing factor. We further show that light-induced apoptosis requires the participation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This was demonstrated by culturing fibroblasts (BJhTERT cells) in ethidium bromide for 40 days to deplete their mitochondrial DNA and perturb their mitochondrial respiratory chain function (BJhTERT rh0 cells). Only BJhTERT cells, with intact mitochondrial respiratory chain function were affected by light insult. Finally, we show that exposure of anaesthetized pigmented rat eye to white, but not red light, causes changes in the expression of certain retinal mRNAs (neurofilament light, Thy-1 and melanopsin) and optic nerve proteins (neurofilament light and tubulin), suggesting that ganglion cell survival is affected. Our findings support the proposal that the interaction of light, particularly the blue component, with intra-axonal ganglion cell mitochondria may be deleterious under certain circumstances, and suggest that reducing the light energy impinging upon the retina might benefit patients with certain optic neuropathies.",Excluded
3047,"Laser energy reaching the posterior pole during transscleral cyclophotocoagulation OBJECTIVE: To measure scattered laser energy reaching the posterior pole during transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.METHODS: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was performed on 4 cadaver eyes with Nd:YAG noncontact, Nd:YAG contact, and diode contact lasers. Energy was measured with a photodiode through a 7-mm trephined hole in the posterior pole. Average percentage power, average power, and average energy transmission were calculated. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines were used to calculate allowable energy exposures for each laser.RESULTS: All 3 lasers transmitted 3% to 5% of the power to the posterior pole. The average energy transmission was 240 to 260 mJ for all lasers. The contact lasers had an average power transmission of 120 mW. The noncontact Nd:YAG laser, with shorter pulse duration, had an average power transmission of 13,000 mW, significantly greater than that of the other lasers. The ACGIH guidelines for allowable energy exposures were 93 mJ for the noncontact Nd:YAG laser, 1300 mJ for the contact Nd:YAG laser, and 440 mJ for the contact diode laser.CONCLUSIONS: Three percent to 5% of laser power delivered during cyclophotocoagulation reaches the posterior pole. Exposure energies may approach or exceed ACGIH guidelines. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be shown.",Excluded

Results ""Alzheimer-like"" hallmarks found in these mechanical stress-based models were compared with AD features found in transgenic models. Discussion The goal of this review is, therefore, to build on current concepts of onset and progression of AD lesions. We point to the importance of accumulated mechanical stress in brain as an environmental and endogenous factor that pushes protein deposition and neuronal injury over the disease threshold.

2612,"Loss of Pde6 reduces cell body Ca(2+) transients within photoreceptors Modulation of Ca(2+) within cells is tightly regulated through complex and dynamic interactions between the plasma membrane and internal compartments. In this study, we exploit in vivo imaging strategies based on genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators to define changes in perikaryal Ca(2+) concentration of intact photoreceptors. We developed double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing GCaMP3 in all cones and tdTomato in long-wavelength cones to test the hypothesis that photoreceptor degeneration induced by mutations in the phosphodiesterase-6 (Pde6) gene is driven by excessive [Ca(2+)]i levels within the cell body. Arguing against Ca(2+) overload in Pde6 mutant photoreceptors, simultaneous analysis of cone photoreceptor morphology and Ca(2+) fluxes revealed that degeneration of pde6c(w59) mutant cones, which lack the cone-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase, is not associated with sustained increases in perikaryal [Ca(2+)]i. Analysis of [Ca(2+)]i in dissociated Pde6beta(rd1)mouse rods shows conservation of this finding across vertebrates. In vivo, transient and Pde6-independent Ca(2+) elevations ('flashes') were detected throughout the inner segment and the synapse. As the mutant cells proceeded to degenerate, these Ca(2+) fluxes diminished. This study thus provides insight into Ca(2+) dynamics in a common form of inherited blindness and uncovers a dramatic, light-independent modulation of [Ca(2+)]i that occurs in normal cones.",Excluded
2835,"Action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the isolated photosensory pineal organ The effect of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), its agonists (muscimol, baclofen) and antagonist (bicuculline) on pineal ganglion cells of the luminosity type were studied in the isolated, superfused pineal organ of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Extracellular recordings revealed that GABA added through the superfusion medium caused a clear alteration of the activity of projecting neurons, which transmit luminosity responses to the brain. Spontaneous discharges of ganglion cells were predominantly suppressed by GABA (33 neurons out of 48), but 10 neurons were clearly excited. Similar effects were observed after addition of muscimol, but not of baclofen. Bicuculline reversed the GABA and muscimol induced inhibition or excitation. In 4 neurons of the luminosity type, GABA caused bidirectional, inhibitory and excitatory responses depending on the state of light- or dark-adaptation. These observations suggest a role of a GABAergic mechanism in the generation and transmission of luminosity responses in the trout pineal organ. It appears that GABA participates in the modulation of light sensitivity during light- and dark-adaptation processes and that this action is mediated by GABAA receptors.",Excluded
3286,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report) Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC.",Excluded

The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers. There was no evidence of blood brain barrier leakage. These studies show that the rabbit eye can be affected by microwave radiation at intensities lower than previously reported.",Excluded
3437,"Outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for arubaeligible patients Introduction: The ARUBA trial is designed to determine whether medical management improves long-term outcomes in patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) compared to interventional therapy. Method(s): Retrospective review of 164 ARUBA-eligible patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) from 1990-2005 with more than two years of follow-up. The median patient age was 42.8 years. Sixty-five AVMs (40%) were Spetzler-Martin grade I-II; the median radiosurgery-based AVM score (RBAS) was 1.48. The median follow-up was 67.5 months; 44 patients (27%) had 10 or more years of follow-up. Result(s): Fifteen patients (9%) bled at a median of 21 months (range, 7-70) after SRS. Six patients (4%) had new deficits and 4 patients died (2%). The risk of stroke was 10% at 5-years and 11% at 10-years. Twelve additional patients (7%) had a Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) decline from either radiation-related complications (n=7) or subsequent resection (n=5). The risk of MRS decline was 13% at 5-years and 16% at 10-years. Factors associated with MRS decline were increasing AVM volume (P=0.002), higher AVM grade (P=0.01), and higher RBAS (P=0.002). The 5-year and 10-year risk of MRS decline for patients with Spetzler- Martin grade I-II AVMs or a RBAS less than 1.5 was 5%. Conclusion(s): Although the observed risk of stroke and MRS decline after SRS was similar to the expected risk in the medical management group of ARUBA at the planned follow-up interval of that trial (5-year risk, 5%-20%), younger patients with small, unruptured AVMs may benefit from SRS compared to medical management at longer follow-up periods.",Excluded
3181,"Spatial correlation of linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness with suspected treatment-related toxicities following proton therapy for intracranial tumors PURPOSE: The enhanced relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at the end of the proton range might increase the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. This is of special concern for intracranial treatments where several critical organs at risk (OARs) surround the tumor. In the light of this, a retrospective analysis of dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET<sub>d</sub> ) and RBE-weighted dose (D<sub>RBE</sub> ) distributions was conducted for three clinical cases with suspected treatment-related toxicities following intracranial proton therapy. Alternative treatment strategies aiming to reduce toxicity risks are also presented.METHODS: The clinical single-field optimized (SFO) plans were recalculated for 81 error scenarios with a Monte Carlo dose engine. The fractionation D<sub>RBE</sub> was 1.8 Gy (RBE) in 28 or 30 fractions assuming a constant RBE of 1.1. Two LET<sub>d</sub> - and alpha/beta-dependent variable RBE models were used for evaluation, including a sensitivity analysis of the alpha/beta parameter. Resulting distributions of D<sub>RBE</sub> and LET<sub>d</sub> were analyzed together with normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs). Subsequently, four multi-field optimized (MFO) plans, with an additional beam and/or objectives penalizing protons stopping in OARs, were created to investigate the potential reduction of LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP.RESULTS: The two variable RBE models agreed well and predicted average RBE values around 1.3 in the toxicity volumes, resulting in an increased near-maximum D<sub>RBE</sub> of 7-11 Gy (RBE) compared to RBE = 1.1 in the nominal scenario. The corresponding NTCP estimates increased from 0.8%, 0.0%, and 3.7% (RBE = 1.1) to 15.5%, 1.8%, and 45.7% (Wedenberg RBE model) for the three patients, respectively. The MFO plans generally allowed for LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP reductions in OARs, without compromising the target dose. Compared to the clinical SFO plans, the maximum reduction in the near-maximum LET<sub>d</sub> was 56%, 63%, and 72% in the OAR exhibiting the toxicity for the three patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although a direct causality between RBE and toxicity cannot be established here, high LET<sub>d</sub> and D<sub>RBE</sub> correlated spatially with the observed toxicities, whereas setup and range uncertainties had a minor impact. Individual factors, which might affect the patient-specific radiosensitivity, were however not included in these calculations. The MFO plans using both an additional beam and proton track-end objectives allowed the largest reductions in LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP, and might be future tools for similar cases.",Excluded

The presyncopal group is characterized by low vascular resistance before and after flight and low norepinephrine release during orthostatic stress on landing day. Our purpose was to determine the mechanisms of the differences between presyncopal and nonpresyncopal groups. We studied 23 astronauts 10 days before launch, on landing day, and 3 days after landing. We measured pressor responses to phenylephrine injections; norepinephrine release with tyramine injections; plasma volumes; resting plasma levels of chromogranin A (a marker of sympathetic nerve terminal release), endothelin, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG, an intracellular metabolite of norepinephrine); and lymphocyte beta<inf>2</inf>-adrenergic receptors. We then measured hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to upright tilt. Astronauts were separated into two groups according to their ability to complete 10 min of upright tilt on landing day. Compared with astronauts who were not presyncopal on landing day, presyncopal astronauts had 1) significantly smaller pressor responses to phenylephrine both before and after flight; 2) significantly smaller baseline norepinephrine, but significantly greater DHPG levels, on landing day; 3) significantly greater norepinephrine release with tyramine on landing day; and 4) significantly smaller norepinephrine release, but significantly greater epinephrine and arginine vasopressin release, with upright tilt on landing day. These data suggest that the etiology of orthostatic hypotension and presyncope after spaceflight includes low alpha<inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responsiveness before flight and a remodeling of the central nervous system during spaceflight such that sympathetic responses to baroreceptor input become impaired.",Excluded

Since their discovery, HSC have been the focus of intensive research, and have proven invaluable clinically to restore hematopoiesis following inadvertent radiation exposure and following radio/chemotherapy to eliminate hematologic tumors. While they were originally discovered in the bone marrow, HSC can also be isolated from umbilical cord blood and can be ""mobilized"" peripheral blood, making them readily available in relatively large quantities. While their ability to repopulate the entire hematopoietic system would already guarantee HSC a valuable place in regenerative medicine, the finding that hematopoietic chimerism can induce immunological tolerance to solid organs and correct autoimmune diseases has dramatically broadened their clinical utility. The demonstration that these cells, through a variety of mechanisms, can also promote repair/regeneration of non-hematopoietic tissues as diverse as liver, heart, and brain has further increased their clinical value.

However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death. The valley doses, influenced by beam spacing and irradiated dose, could represent important survival factors for MRT.",Included

The aim of the study was to analyze the positive margin cases in our Breast Unit, risk factors for inadequate margin and the impact of positive margin on outcomes after breast-conserving therapy. Material(s) and Method(s): 107 women with invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N0-2, M0) diagnosed between 2005-2010, who underwent breastconserving surgery(BCS) as first surgery, were retrospectively selected from the Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital Breast Unit Registry. A positive resection margin was defined as a microscopic invasive or in situ tumor at the cutting edge in permanent pathologic reports. Result(s): The mean tumor size was 1.65 cm in the positive margin group and 1.68 cm in the other group(p > 0.893). 13 of 107 (12.1%) had positive margins at initial resection. Of these patients 4(30.7%)had involved caudal margin, 2 (15.3%) cranial margin, 2 (15.3%) medial margin, 2(15.3%) deep margin and 1 (7.6%) lateral margin, there were insufficient data available about the type of margin in 2 cases. 8 (61.5%) had an invasive carcinoma at the margins and in other cases carcinoma in situ was detected. 4 (30.7%) underwent additional surgery-mastectomy, to achieve negative margins.

Patients with a positive margins at the initial resection showed higher lobular histology rate (15.3% vs. 6.4%), incidence of multiple ipsilateral tumors (23.1% vs. 15.4%), presens of intraductal component (76.9% vs. 65.1%), but these differences between two groups were no statistically significant. 73.1% of all patients were tested for the two common founder mutaions in BRCA1(4153delA and 5382insC). There was 1 BRCA1(5382insC) mutation-positive patient in the other group and no mutation-positive patients in the positive margin group. Mean follow-up time was 19.9(11-37) months, and there were no local recurrences during the follow-up period in the tumor positive margin group. Conclusion(s): The overall percentage of positive margins in the Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital Breast Unit is within the predefined targets. Lobular histology, multiple ipsilateral tumors and presens of intraductal component have shown a tendency of higher risk for inadequate margins of excision..",Excluded
2725,"An attempt to influence DNA content in postmitotic Purkinje cells of the cerebellum Feulgen-DNA content has been measured cytophotometrically in granule and Purkinje cells of the rat and mouse cerebellum. The study has confirmed that under normal conditions a very small part of the P. cell population in rats (less than 3%) possesses a Feulgen-DNA surplus ranging from 2C to 4C. In mice, the hyperdiploid (H2C) P. cells are even more rare. The occurrence of H2C-P. cells in rats and probably also in mice has not been substantially changed in animals exposed to factors interfering with chromatin structure and/or its template activity; the H2C-P. cells seem to be slightly more frequent after injecting mice with corticoids (Urbason) or in animals suffering from ectromelia or hereditary Purkinje cell degeneration. The incidence of H2C-P. cells has neither been substantially affected by experimental conditions which are known to lead to functional and/or metabolic stimulation of the cerebellum. Functional changes in the number of H2C-P. cell nuclei may, however, be short-term or transient in character and therefore might have excaped detection in our models. The findings rule out an impact of some reasons suspected for the artefactual origin of Feulgen H2C DNA values as e.g. compactness of the chromatin.",Excluded
3454,"Neuropelveology. Hope for patients suffering from intractable pelvic pain and for people with spinal cord injury (SCI)?. [German] Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) are common conditions involving many medical specialities, each with its own approach to diagnosis and treatment. Management of these conditions requires knowledge of pelvic organ systems, neuro-functional pelvic anatomy, and of the musculoskeletal, neurologic and psychiatric aspects. No current speciality seems to be devoted to all these aspects of the field. Neuropelveology is an emerging speciality focusing on the pathologies of the pelvic nervous system. It is based on a neurological/ neurosurgical approach combining the knowledge required for a proper neurologic diagnosis with advanced laparoscopic surgery in selected cases of CPP/CPPS. The laparoscopic approach to the pelvic nerves enables nerve-sparing techniques, neurosurgical procedures but also selective placement of stimulating electrodes to all nerves and plexuses for treatment of neuropathic pain and dysfunctions. For patients with spinal cord injuries, this technique enables new strategies for control/recovery-assisted locomotion in selected paraplegics. The development of new technologies does not only assist spinal cord injured people with the common problems associated with inertia when confined to a wheelchair, but finds further revolutionary applications in the world of space missions. In addressing the physical disadvantages the astronaut faces when weightless in space by the introduction of an >>in-body<< micro stimulator, which allows muscle mass and bone density to be maintained even whilst the astronaut is sleeping, the stimulating technique provides an extremely effective and time-saving strength training program. The advantages of the LION Procedure (Laparoscopic Implantation of Neuroprothesis) are profound when it comes to counteracting the effects of prolonged microgravity on the human body. It should be also appreciated that the capability of the implantation of micro stimulators within the body to nerves for muscle stimulation, opens the door to a whole new area of humanity, the >>e-control-body<<, in which implanted electronics may help the human body to better performance and a longer life as a result (ageing control).

3284,"The contribution of DNA and chromosome repair deficiencies to the radiosensitivity of ataxia-telangiectasia Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype.",Included
2446,"Transformation of benign metastasizing leiomyoma to leiomyosarcoma INTRODUCTION: Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare entity in which solitary leiomyoma-like nodules are present in a distant location. The origin is presumed to be the uterus, occurring predominantly in women of reproductive age. It is extremely atypical for BML to undergo malignant transformation. Here we present a rare case of BML transforming to leiomyosarcoma. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a 53 year old female with a history of benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) who was admitted for dyspnea. She underwent a hysterectomy in 1996. That same year she suffered a spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to a ruptured lung cyst. In 2005 she underwent a left thoracotomy with resection of a new cystic lesion. Pathology was consistent with BML (positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, CD10, desmin, smooth muscle actin, caldesmon but negative for HMB-45 stain) and she was started on anastrazole. She underwent a redo thoracotomy in 2011 with resection of a pleural-based giant tumor; the pathology again confirmed BML. In January 2017 she was admitted for progressive shortness of breath, right shoulder pain and headache. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) brain showed a right superior frontal mass. Contrast tomography (CT) chest showed worsening of nodular densities without significant cystic changes (image1). A MRI of her right shoulder demonstrated a large mass at the lateral third of the clavicle. Subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) revealed extensive hyper-metabolic activity consistent with metastasis. The right frontal and right clavicular masses were biopsied and pathology was consistent with leiomyosarcoma (image 2). Unfortunately, she was not a candidate for chemotherapy or radiation and ultimately expired. DISCUSSION: BML is a rare disease entity with only 150 reported cases to date.1 The lungs are the most common site of metastatic spread. Radiographically BML appears as well-circumscribed, multiple solid nodules. Uncommonly, as seen in our patient, it can present as cavitation or cysts, increasing the risk for pneumothorax. Typically, the tumors maintain the benign nature of uterine leiomyomas as evidenced by their lack of avidity on PET and low mitotic activity.2 This is the third reported case of malignant transformation. Few guidelines exist for managing BML although current treatment includes surgical resection or hormone modulating therapies. CONCLUSION(S): Transformation of BML to leiomyosarcoma is uncommon.",Excluded

The use of antistress agents (clofelin, pentamine) and intravenous laser blood irradiation leads to a more prompt arrest of hyperergic reaction of the neuroendocrine system and to the reduction of immunosuppressing effect of burn trauma, which decreases the number of pyoseptic complications from 26.4 to 16% and total lethality from 16 to 3.8%.",Excluded
2828,"Structural analysis of the alpha N-terminal region of erythroid and nonerythroid spectrins by small-angle X-ray scattering We used SpalphaI-1-156 peptide, a well-characterized model peptide of the alphaN-terminal region of erythrocyte spectrin, and SpalphaII-1-149, an alphaII brain spectrin model peptide similar in sequence to SpalphaI-1-156, to study their association affinities with a betaI-spectrin peptide, SpbetaI-1898-2083, by isothermal titration calorimetry. We also determined their conformational flexibilities in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) methods. These two peptides exhibit sequence homology and could be expected to exhibit similar association affinities with beta-spectrin. However, our studies show that the affinity of SpalphaII-1-149 with SpbetaI-1898-2083 is much higher than that of SpalphaI-1-156. Our SAXS findings also indicate a significantly more extended conformation for SpalphaII-1-149 than for SpalphaI-1-156. The radius of gyration values obtained by two different analyses of SAXS data and by molecular modeling all show a value of about 25 A for SpalphaI-1-156 and of about 30 A for SpalphaII-1-149, despite the fact that SpalphaI-1-156 has seven amino acid residues more than SpalphaII-1-149. For SpalphaI-1-156, the SAXS results are consistent with a flexible junction between helix C' and the triple helical bundle that allows multiple orientations between these two structural elements, in good agreement with our published NMR analysis. The SAXS findings for SpalphaII-1-149 support the hypothesis that this junction region is rigid (and probably helical) for alphaII brain spectrin. The nature of the junction region, from one extreme as a random coil (conformationally mobile) segment in alphaI to another extreme as a rigid segment in alphaII, determines the orientation of helix C' relative to the first structural domain. We suggest that this particular junction region in alpha-spectrin plays a major role in modulating its association affinity with beta-spectrins, and thus regulates spectrin tetramer levels. We also note that these are the first conformational studies of brain spectrin.",Excluded

2824,"Correlation of visual field, treatment fields, and dose in helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma We correlated predicted radiation distributions in 29 patients with uveal melanoma (treated with 5,000 to 8,000 rads of helium ion therapy) with fundus photography and visual field deficits. The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells. Development of an absolute scotoma may require a dose in excess of 5,000 rads.",Excluded
2698,"Acute Effect of Low-Dose Space Radiation on Mouse Retina and Retinal Endothelial Cells There is concern that degradation of vision as a result of space flight may compromise both mission goals and long-term quality of life after space travel. The visual disturbances may be due to a combination of intracerebral pressure changes and exposure to ionizing radiation. The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy). Eyes were isolated for examining endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and characterization of apoptosis in retina and retinal endothelial cells at two weeks postirradiation. The expression of eNOS was significantly increased in the retina after proton and <sup>16</sup>O ion exposure. <sup>16</sup>O ions induced over twofold increase in eNOS expression compared to proton exposure at two weeks postirradiation ( P < 0.05). TUNEL assays showed dose-dependent increases in apoptosis in the retina after irradiation. Low doses of <sup>16</sup>O ions elicited apoptosis in the mouse retinal endothelial cells with the most robust changes observed after 0.1 Gy irradiation ( P < 0.05) compared to controls. Data also showed that <sup>16</sup>O ions induced a higher frequency of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells compared to protons ( P < 0.05). In summary, our study revealed that exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the retina. Significant changes in retinal endothelial cells occur at doses as low as 0.1 Gy. There were significant differences in the responses of endothelial cells among the radiation types examined here.",Included
3580,"Some perturbations that disturb the circadian melatonin rhythm The circadian melatonin rhythm is highly reproducible and generally not easily altered. The few perturbations that are capable of significantly changing either the amplitude or the pattern of the 24-h melatonin rhythm are summarized herein. Aging alters cyclic melatonin production by decreasing the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin peak in all species in which it has been studied. The best known acute suppressor of nocturnal melatonin is light exposure. The brightness of light required to acutely depress pineal melatonin production is species dependent; of the visible wavelengths, those in the blue range (approximately 500-520 nm) seem most effective in suppressing melatonin production. Nonvisible, nonionizing radiation in the extremely low frequency range (e.g., 60 Hz) seems also capable of altering pineal melatonin synthesis. Hormones have relatively little influence on the circadian production of melatonin, although either adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy does attenuate the amplitude of the melatonin cycle. Exercise at the time of high melatonin production rapidly depresses pineal concentrations of the indole without influencing its synthesis; the mechanism of this suppression remains unknown.

2564,"Epidemiology of intracranial meningioma Intracranial meningiomas arise from the meninges and typically have benign histologic findings. They constitute approximately 20% of all intracranial tumors. Their incidence increases with age, and they affect women more commonly than men. The annual incidence per 100,000 people ranges from two to seven for women and from one to five for men. Since the first study was published in 1970, only eight major epidemiologic studies have been done that attempted to identify risk factors for meningioma. Ionizing radiation and head trauma have emerged as the most promising etiologic risk factors. In these studies, radiation doses as low as 1-2 Gy have been associated with increased risk. The role of dental radiographs has been suggested in some studies but not supported in others. An explanation for the apparent excess of meningiomas in women remains obscure. The potential effects of endogenous or exogenous sex hormones on tumor induction or growth remain unexplored in epidemiologic studies. More should be learned about the risk factors for meningioma in search of opportunities for prevention. [References: 87]",Excluded
3013,"STAT RAD: Prospective Dose Escalation Clinical Trial of Single Fraction Scan-Plan-QA-Treat Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Painful Osseous Metastases PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is a well-established treatment for symptomatic bone metastases. Despite continued advances in both planning techniques and treatment delivery, the standard workflow has remained relatively unchanged, often requiring 1 to 3 weeks and resulting in patient inconvenience and delayed palliation. We developed an expedited method wherein computed tomography simulation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery are performed in 1 day. This prospective pilot clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and patient satisfaction of this rapid workflow.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with 1 to 3 painful bone metastases were prospectively enrolled and treated with 1 fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, using a same-day Scan-Plan-QA-Treat workflow, termed STAT RAD, in a phase 1/2 dose escalation trial from 8 Gy to 15 Gy per fraction. Bone pain, opioid use, patient satisfaction, performance status, and quality of life were evaluated before and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after treatment. Outcomes and treatment-related toxicity were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were enrolled, and 46 patients with 60 bone metastases were treated per the protocol. Partial or greater pain response occurred in 50% of patients at 1 week, 75% of patients at 8 weeks, 68.7% of patients at 6 months, and 33.3% of patients at 12 months. There were 2 grade-3 toxicities, including 1 spinal fracture associated with disease progression and hyperbilirubinemia. Reirradiation was required in 16.7% of treated lesions at a median time to retreatment of 4.9 months. Most patient responses (78.6%) indicated that patients would choose this workflow again.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that treating bone metastases with palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy via a single-fraction, patient-centric workflow is feasible and safe with doses up to 15 Gy. However, pain response decreased at 12 months and was associated with a 16.7% retreatment rate, which suggests that further dose escalation is warranted.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to retrospectively determine optimal treatment strategies for linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and to investigate possible prognostic factors. Method(s): Of 156 patients treated from 1990 to 2001, 124 patients with 312 lesions were treated with SRS alone, and followed-up for periods ranging from 15 days to 24 months (median 8.2 months). There were 86 males and 38 females, with a median age of 62.8 years. Tumor volume ranged from 0.04 to 50.5 ccm (median 7.9 ccm), and radiation doses ranged from 18 to 50 Gy (median 26.6 Gy in one fraction). Univariate and multivariate analyses of survival and tumor volume reduction rate were performed using Kaplan-Meier Curves, analysis of variance and log-rank test techniques. Result(s): Median survival time was 8.2 months after SRS. The overall tumor control rate was 97.2%, with a complete or partial remission rate of 84.4%. The median follow-up time was 8.2 months following SRS. During follow-up, there was one case of fetal intracerebral hemorrhage (1.0%) and 6 cases of cerebral herniation (6.3%). Tumor reduction rate was related to tumor histology (p < 0.01). Survival rate correlated with pre-SRS Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (p < 0.01), a number of brain lesions (p = 0.0075) and primary disease status (p < 0.05), but was not related to progression of extracranial disease, age, lesion volume or lesion site. Conclusion(s): SRS is indicated for brain metastases under the following circumstances: (1) lesions <=40mm in diameter.

A median prescription dose of 75 Gy (range: 70-80 Gy) was delivered to the involved trigeminal nerve root entry zone. Treatment outcomes were assessed through patient self-reports of pain control and medication usage during follow-up visits. In addition, patients responded to a standard questionnaire containing the Barrow Neurologic Institute Pain Scale (BNI) and selected sections of the McGill Pain Scale. Treatment outcomes and objective quality of life measures were also addressed.RESULTS: Ninety-six patients (86%) completed questionnaires for a median follow-up of 30 months (range: 8-66 months). Seventy-four patients (77%) reported pain relief occurring after a median of 3 weeks (range: 0-24 weeks) after GKRS. A decrease in medication usage was noted in 66% of patients. Actuarial analysis demonstrated 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year recurrence rates of 23%, 33%, and 39%, respectively. Response to treatment was associated with lack of prior surgical treatment (p = 0.03) and less than 50 months' pain duration before GKRS (p = 0.04). Patients who described their TN pain as more severe than their worst non-TN headache pain (McGill Pain Scale IV-V vs. I-III) were also more likely to respond to treatment (p < 0.001). Seven (7.3%) patients reported new or increased trigeminal dysfunction; however, only 3.1% reported these symptoms as bothersome (BNI III-IV). Patients with sustained pain relief reported an average of 100% improvement in their QOL as a direct result of pain relief after GKRS, and 100% believed that the procedure was successful. Furthermore, among those patients with temporary pain relief and subsequent recurrence, 65% felt their treatment was a success with an average of 80% improvement in their QOL.CONCLUSIONS: GKRS provides significant pain relief and improves QOL in the majority of patients treated for TN, with few bothersome side effects. Patients with both temporary and sustained responses to treatment realized significant improvements in QOL after GKRS, and considered their treatment successful. Longer follow-up of these patients may reveal additional recurrences highlighting the importance of studies evaluating repeat GKRS and optimization of current treatment techniques and patient selection.",Excluded

They are highly sensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation and also fail to demonstrate the normal inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with this type of DNA-damaging agent. Additionally, a number of ataxia-telangiectasia lymphoblastoid lines have been shown to have an unusual regulation of the cellular actin levels. However, the primary lesion causing ataxia-telangiectasia is unknown. In this paper we report an altered cellular morphology in three ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblast lines, but not in a number of control fibroblast lines. Investigation of the cytoskeleton using antibodies against certain cytoskeletal proteins revealed a difference in the microfilament pattern from ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts compared to controls. Ataxia fibroblasts showed a microfilament stress fiber pattern that appeared to have a more well defined and abundant array of stress fibers than control fibroblasts. In contrast, no differences were observed in the microtubule array, nor in the vinculin patterns between any of the cell lines. In addition to the differences in the microfilament patterns, ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts differed in their ability to recover from microfilament disruption by dimethyl sulfoxide. Control fibroblasts returned to a normal cellular state in a shorter time compared to ataxia fibroblasts, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence using antiactin.

One process (fast) changes quickly with change in illumination, has a reversal potential at +20 mv, and has an I-V curve with positive slope resistance at all voltages. These properties are consistent with a light-induced change in membrane conductance to sodium ions.

Background(s): Glioblastoma (GB) is a WHO Grade IV tumor typically arising in the supratentorial compartment of the brain. Gliomas arising from cranial nerves (CN) are extremely rare. Design/Methods: A 77 year old gentleman presented with four month history of numbness over the right side of his face and progressive bilateral hearing loss. One week prior to presentation, he also developed left facial weakness, left eye ptosis, diplopia and lower back pain. On examination, he was found to have loss of sensation in a V1-V3 distribution on the right, a left pupil sparing third nerve palsy, bilateral sensironeural hearing loss, and a left peripheral VII CN palsy Results: MRI brain showed a cisternal mass infiltrating the right CN V with extensive enhancement and thickening of bilateral CN including III, V, VII, and VIII. MRI of the spine showed nodular enhancement at the level of the cauda equina. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Biopsy of the right CN V mass showed this to be glioblastoma. Conclusion(s): Leptomeningeal dissemination of glioblastoma is rare, occurring in about 4% of cases. In most of these cases, a parenchymal component is present that eventually disseminates along the ependymal lining of the brain to involve the leptomeninges. We here describe a unique presentation of a GB most likely arising from a CN followed by widespread leptomeningeal dissemination. The root entry zone (either the glial segment or the transition segment) of the cranial nerve is thought to be the anatomical point of origin for gliomas arising from CNs.

Therefore, the treatment rationale is characterized by reduction of symptoms and inhibition of complications. Regarding reduction of pain, treatment of (impending) fractures, and spinal cord compression radiation is an important part of palliative treatment. In our retrospective study we report the effect of radiotherapy on reduction of pain, recalcification and the reduction of neurological symptoms and evaluate factors which have an impact on therapeutic outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1, Jan 1988 to 31, Dec 1998, 42 patients (19 women, 23 men; range of ages 46 to 85 years, median age 64.9 years) with 71 target volumes were irradiated (median dose 36 Gy, 2 to 3 Gy 5 times/week) because of symptomatic disease (67/71: osseous pain, 45/71: fractures/impending fractures, 13/71: spinal cord compression) (Tables 1 and 2). The median time from diagnosis to the first course of radiotherapy was 11.9 months (0.3 to 90 months). At the time of first irradiation, 5 and 37 patients were in tumor Stage II and III (Salmon/Durie), respectively. The median value of the Karnofsky performance was 70% (40 to 90%).RESULTS: During follow-up (at least 6 months) in 85% of target volumes complete and partial pain relief (measured by patients' perception and the use of analgetic medication) was achieved; recurrences were seen in 8.8%. In 26/56 (46.4%) lesions evaluable a recalcification was seen whereas 17.9% showed progressive disease (comparison of radiographs before and after radiation). In 22.3% of all lesions initially with impending fracture (4/18) radiotherapy failed because of fracture after treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Simultaneous chemotherapy and a Karnofsky performance > or = 70 had a significant impact on a positive response to treatment, respectively. Spinal cord compression symptoms were reduced in 7/13 (53.8%) of patients (scaled due to the classification by Findlay 1987). The median survival from diagnosis for the entire group was 34.9 months (7.5 to 119.3 months), after irradiation 13.1 months (0.2 to 105.3 months) (Figure 1).CONCLUSION: When adequately indicated radiotherapy has shown to be an effective palliative treatment. Taking under consideration that the results are retrospective we suppose that in multiple myeloma the local response to radiation is supported by a favorable performance status and simultaneous chemotherapy.

Three-dimensional treatment planning calculations are used to compare dose distributions for several different radiation types and irradiation geometries. Calculations were performed using charged particles (H, He, C, and Ne ions) and the irradiation geometry currently used at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Photons in the Gamma Knife configuration and the Heidelberg Linac arc method are used. The 3-dimensional dose distributions were evaluated by means of dose-volume histograms and integral doses to the target volume and to normal brain. The effects of target volume, shape and location are studied. The charged particle dose distributions are more favorable than those of the photon methods. The differences between charged particles and photons increase with increasing target volume. The differences between different charged particle species are small, as are the effects of target shape and location.",Excluded
3424,"The analysis of I125 brachytherapy complications in cases of uveal melanoma. [Polish] PURPOSE: Analysis of type and frequency of complications after brachytherapy 1125 between 1-12 months after treatment and during the following controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 147 persons (76 men and 71 women) aged 23-86 years (mean 57 years), were treated in our clinic in 1998-2001. In 43% of the cases the thickness of the tumor was more than 8 mm and in 94% the maximum diameter was bigger than 8.1 mm. The irradiation dose was 80-120 Gy, mean 100 Gy. RESULT(S): Regression and stabilization of the tumor was achieved in 84.3% of all cases. Complications of different type and intensity associated with brachytherapy I125 were observed in majority of the cases. The complications observed were: radiation retinopathy (52%), radiation maculopathy (33.6%), radiation optic neuropathy (25.3%), vitreous hemorrhage (8.8%), glaucoma (20.5%) and cataract (18.5%). CONCLUSION(S): 125I brachytherapy yields good results in cases of uveal melanoma, however it's associated with post radiation complications.",Excluded
3280,"Comparing DNA damage induced by mobile telephony and other types of man-made electromagnetic fields The number of studies showing adverse effects on living organisms induced by different types of man-made Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) has increased tremendously. Hundreds of peer reviewed published studies show a variety of effects, the most important being DNA damage which is linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive declines etc. Those studies that are far more effective in showing effects employ real-life Mobile Telephony (MT) exposures emitted by commercially available mobile phones. The present review - of results published by my group from 2006 until 2016 - compares DNA fragmentation induced by six different EMFs on the same biological system - the oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster - under identical conditions and procedures. Such a direct comparison between different EMFs - especially those employed in daily life - on the same biological endpoint, is very useful for drawing conclusions on their bioactivity, and novel. It shows that real MT EMFs are far more damaging than 50 Hz alternating magnetic field (MF) - similar or much stronger to those of power lines - or a pulsed electric field (PEF) found before to increase fertility. The MT EMFs were significantly more bioactive even for much shorter exposure durations than the other EMFs. Moreover, they were more damaging than previously tested cytotoxic agents like certain chemicals, starvation, dehydration. Individual parameters of the real MT EMFs like intensity, frequency, exposure duration, polarization, pulsing, modulation, are discussed in terms of their role in bioactivity. The crucial parameter for the intense bioactivity seems to be the extreme variability of the polarized MT signals, mainly due to the large unpredictable intensity changes.

3031,"Single domain antibody (SBT-100) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and inhibits human glioblastoma by selectively targeting KRAS and P-STAT3 Background: Glioblastoma is difficult to treat malignancy that has a high incidence of KRAS mutations ( > 90%) and hyper-expression of P-STAT3 ( > 90%). Most chemotherapeutic agents and large biologics (four chain heterotetrameric IgG) cannot cross the BBB. Therefore Singh Biotechnology's (SBT) propriety technology has developed a novel targeted therapy and engineered SBT-100 a 15 kD single domain antibody (sdAb) that is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3, which can cross the BBB to target gliablastomas. Method(s): Human glioblastoma (U87MG) cell line was used and obtained from ATCC. Biacore affinity assay was used to demonstrate SBT-100 binding to KRAS, KRAS (G12D), and STAT3. The glioblastoma cells were incubated with 0ug/ml to 200ug/ml of SBT-100. MTT assay was performed after 3 days of treatment with SBT-100 and the growth inhibition was calculated. Xenograft (athymic nude mouse) with a well established tumor growing for 6 weeks was injected with SBT-100 intraperitoneally (IP). After 15 minutes the brain of this animal was harvested for immunohistochemical staining. Result(s): Biacore studies showed SBT-100 binds KRAS with affinity constant of 10- 9M, KRAS (G12D) at 10- 8M, and STAT3 at 10- 8M. MTT assay reveals 62% (p < 0.01) growth inhibition of U87MG within 3 days. A xenograft mouse with a well established tumor ( > 150mm<sup>3</sup>), when injected IP with 5mg/kg of SBT-100 showed localization in the brain within 15 minutes. Therefore SBT-100 (sdAb) crosses the BBB, and shows intracellular localization in the animal's neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): SBT-100 significantly inhibits the growth of glioblastoma. KRAS mutations and/or over expression of P-STAT3 in glioblastomas are promising targets for sdAbs like SBT-100, which is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3. SBT-100 crosses the BBB and localizes within the neurons and glial cells of the brain. SBT's proprietary single domain antibody technology platform used to engineer SBT- 100 holds promise for targeting primary brain malignancies, metastatic cancers that go to the brain, and for neurologic disease amenable to targeted therapy. Many chemo-resistant and radiation-resistant cancers use STAT3 as an escape mechanism.",Excluded

2831,"Role of thin-sliced reformatted ct imaging for acute ischemic stroke patients, do we need CT angiography before deciding for acute neurointervention? Objective: To investigate if thin-sliced reformatted non-contrast CT scans could be reliably used to detect and measure size of the thrombus in patients with LVOs. Background(s): Thin-sliced reformatted non-contrast CT head are not considered sensitive enough for thrombus detection. CTA is done to confirm large vessel occlusion. CTA adds extra radiation and contrast. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent acute endovascular intervention for LVOs at a community based, university affiliated comprehensive stroke center during two year period (Jan 2015-Dec 2016) was done. The raw data of non-enhanced CT scans and CTAs were collected. All raw data were reconstructed with thin slices of 0.625 mm using standard GE software. Vessel diameter and clot length were measured on both CT and CTA. (5- mm maximum intensity projections of the thin slices on CT and axial/coronal projections on CTA). Each patient's CT and CTA were paired for length and diameter in millimeters. Paired two sample hypothesis test was run on SPSS. Result(s): 926 patients presented with acute ischemic stroke during the specified time period. Of those 99 were LVOs that received endovascular treatment of which, 37 had both CT and CTA done and had intracranial lesions. Mean clot length was 13.99 (SD 5.34) on thin slices CT and 14.18 (SD 5.64) on CTA. Vessel diameter was 2.83 (SD 0.54) on thin sliced CT and 2.55 (SD 0.51) on CTA. There was no significant difference in estimated clot length done on CT as compared with CTA. (P=0.601) There was significant difference in estimated vessel diameter on CT as compared with CTA. Conclusion(s): Thin-sliced reconstructions of standard cranial nonenhanced CT raw data can be reliably used to detect and measure the thrombus size in LVOs. It does slightly overestimate the vessel diameter but still making intervention planning possible. Larger multicenter trials are needed to validate our data.",Excluded
2863,"Palliative radiation for spinal metastases: Does the presence of soft tissue disease affect the choice of treatment dose and fractionation? Purpose/Objective(s): Spinal bone metastases associated with soft tissue disease (ST) are frequently considered at higher risk of developing further complications such as neuropathic pain and cord compression. The objectives of our study were to describe the prevalence of ST in patients presenting for spine radiation therapy (XRT), and whether presence of soft tissue disease is associated with a difference in treatment approach compared with those whose do not (nST). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all consecutive patients receiving spine XRT within our palliative radiation program during 2012. Patient demographics, symptoms intensity, performance status and life expectancy were captured at the time of consultation. Diagnostic imaging including CT +/- MRI as well as planning CT relevant to the course of treatment were reviewed to document whether ST, cord compression (CC) or compression fracture (CF) was present at the levels being irradiated. Whether a field based or volume based approach was employed by the radiation oncologist to define the treatment plan was recorded. Binary logistic regression was used for inferences, using the generalized estimating equation approach to adjust the standard error to account for the correlation of observations within a patient. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients receiving 177 treatments were reviewed. This included 19 patients receiving simultaneous treatment to 2 separate sites and 4 patients receiving treatment to 3 sites. The mean age was 64 years. 71% (106/150) of patients in both groups were estimated to have a life expectancy of over 6 months. Fifty-five percent of treatments given were in the lumbosacral area. Nocomplicating radiological features (i.e., noST, CC, CF) was present in 89/177 (50%) of cases. ST was present in 50/177 cases [28% [95% CI 25-32%)]. Of these,32%(16/50) also had aCCand 32%(16/50) had aCF. There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution and source of primary. The proportion of patients with severe pain (>5 on a scale of 0-10) was 46% ST and 60% nST (p = 0.82). Volume based planning was employed for 58% ST and 48% nST. Fractionated treatments (mostly 20 Gy/ 5 fractions) were employed in 84% ST and 66% nST of cases. After adjustment for CC and CF, there was a trend to suggest physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated treatments in cases with ST (p =0.16). Conclusion(s): Fifty percent of treatment courses delivered to spine were associated with some complicating radiological features including ST, SC or CF. ST was present in 28% cases. We were unable to identify any clinical features that would predict for the presence of ST disease. There is a trend that physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated radiation therapy when ST was present.",Excluded
2642,"Substantial ""ependymal-in"" gradient of thalamic damage in progressive multiple sclerosis Introduction: Leptomeningeal inflammation was demonstrated associated with subpial 'surface-in' gradient of damage in multiple sclerosis cortical grey matter. Aim(s): We asked whether a similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter thalamic nuclei as an effect of intrathecal/subependymal inflammation. Method(s): We examined dorsomedial thalamic nuclei tissues and paired CSF samples from 41 post-mortem secondary progressive MS (SPMS) cases, counting MHC-classII+ microglia/ macrophages and NeuN+ neurons in 10 SPMS cases with meningeal tertiary- lymphoid-like structures(TLS+), 10 SPMS cases without meningeal TLS(TLS-) and 5 controls. Result(s): Thalamic demyelination was observed in 90% of cases, and active lesions in 40%. MS cases exhibited significant reduction in NeuN+ neuronal density compared to controls, and this damage exhibited a CSForiented gradient, greatest (26%) in subventricular locations with respect to 12% at 10 mm from the ependyma/ CSF boundary. The gradient was reversed for MHC-II+ microglia density, which was increased by over 50% at 2 mm from the ventricular surface vs 15% at 10 mm. Most of the periventricular MHC-II+ cells (70%) expressed the resident-homeostatic marker TMEM119. These gradients were greatest in TLS+ cases and were associated with: Early age at onset and at death; increased CSF levels of Nf-L, chitinase-3-L1, sTNFR1, TNF, CCL19, CCL21, CCL22, CXCL10, CXCL13, IFNgamma, sCD163, fibrinogen, IL2, and IL10; perivascular sub-ependymal infiltrates containing abundant CD20+B cells, CD3+T cells, plasma cells, scattered CD35+follicular-dendritic cells and CXCL13. Conclusion(s): Increased thalamic pathology is associated with more severe progressive MS and occurs according to ependymal-in gradient accompanied by presence of elevated inflammation, compartmentalized in sub-ependymal lymphoidlike perivascular infiltrates and in CSF.",Excluded
3082,"Diminished neuronal activity increases neuron-neuron connectivity underlying silent synapse formation and the rapid conversion of silent to functional synapses Neuronal activity regulates the synaptic strength of neuronal networks. However, it is still unclear how diminished activity changes connection patterns in neuronal circuits. To address this issue, we analyzed neuronal connectivity and relevant mechanisms using hippocampal cultures in which developmental synaptogenesis had occurred. We show that diminution of network activity in mature neuronal circuit promotes reorganization of neuronal circuits via NR2B subunit-containing NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NR2B-NMDARs), which mediate silent synapse formation. Simultaneous double whole-cell recordings revealed that diminishing neuronal circuit activity for 48 h increased the number of synaptically connected neuron pairs with both silent and functional synapses. This increase was accompanied by the specific expression of NR2B-NMDARs at synaptic sites. Analysis of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) showed that the frequency of NMDAR-mediated, but not AMPAR-mediated, mEPSCs increased, indicating that diminished neuronal activity promotes silent synapse formation via the surface delivering NR2B-NMDARs in mature neurons. After activation of neuronal circuit by releasing from TTX blockade (referred as circuit reactivation), the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs increased instead, and this increase was prevented by ifenprodil. The circuit reactivation also caused an increased colocalization of glutamate receptor 1-specfic and synaptic NR2B-specific puncta. These results indicate that the circuit reactivation converts rapidly silent synapses formed during activity suppression to functional synapses. These data may provide a new example of homeostatic circuit plasticity that entails the modulation of neuron-neuron connectivity by synaptic activity.",Excluded
3457,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included

2776,"Incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing drugs BACKGROUND: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs.METHODS: four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.",Excluded

This Phase II multicenter study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an abbreviated course of RT plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) in older patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one eligible patients 70 years of age or older with newly diagnosed GBM and a Karnofsky performance status >=60 were treated with a short course of RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks) plus TMZ at the dosage of 75 mg/m(2) per day followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m(2) for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and toxicity.RESULTS: The Median OS was 12.4 months, and the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 58% and 20%, respectively. The median and 1-year rates of progression-free survival were 6 months and 20%, respectively. All patients completed the planned programme of RT. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 16 patients (22%). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia occurred in 10 patients (15%), leading to the interruption of treatment in 6 patients (8%). Nonhematologic Grade 3 toxicity was rare, and included fatigue in 4 patients and cognitive disability in 1 patient.CONCLUSIONS: A combination of an abbreviated course of RT plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ is well tolerated and may prolong survival in elderly patients with GBM.

Our aim was to establish the prevalence growth hormone (GH) deficiency and other anterior pituitary dysfunction amongst NPC patients who had cranial irradiation and to determine predictive factors. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, we studied 58 patients (33 males) who had treatment for NPC more than 3 years ago and with no pre-existing hypothalamic-pituitary disorder from other causes. All patients had a complete anterior pituitary function test. Subsequently, the patients underwent dynamic testing with insulin tolerance test (ITT) to assess the somatotroph axis. Result(s): 43(75%) of patients had concurrent chemo-irradiation (CCRT) while 15 (25%) had radiotherapy alone. Median duration from therapy was 8 (3.0-33.0) years. Hypopituitarism was present in 84% of patients. GH deficiency was most common (80%) while corticotroph, gonadotroph and thyrotroph deficiencies were noted in 41,19 and 3% of the patients respectively. GH deficiency was significantly associated with duration from irradiation (9.9 years vs. 5 years, p<0.01) and the use of CCRT compared to those who had radiotherapy alone, OR: 9.5 (2.42-32.7), p<0.01. The mean peak GH response during ITT was inversely correlated with duration from irradiation (r=-0.29, p=0.04) and significantly attenuated in patients who had CCRT compared to radiotherapy alone (p=0.01 at 30 mins and p=0.02 at 60 mins). Conclusion(s): Pituitary mainly GH dysfunction post-NPC irradiation is widespread, and worsens with increasing duration from treatment and the use of CCRT.

3347,"Hitting a moving target: evolution of a treatment paradigm for atypical meningiomas amid changing diagnostic criteria OBJECT: The World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified atypical meningiomas in 2000, creating a more clear and broadly accepted definition. In this paper, the authors evaluated the pathological and clinical transition period for atypical meningiomas according to the implementation of the new WHO grading system at their institution. METHOD(S): A total of 471 meningiomas occurring in 440 patients between 1994 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed to determine changes in diagnostic rates, postoperative treatment trends, and early outcomes. RESULT(S): Between 1994 and 2000, the incidence of the atypical meningiomas ranged from 0 to 3/year, or 4.4% of the meningiomas detected during the entire period. After 2002, the annual percentage of atypical meningiomas rose over a 2-year period, leveling off at between 32.7 and 35.5% between 2004 and 2006. The authors also found a recent trend toward increased use of adjuvant radiation therapy for incompletely resected atypical meningiomas. Prior to 2003, 18.7% were treated with this therapy; after 2003, 34.4% of lesions received this treatment. Incompletely resected tumors were treated with some form of radiation 76% of the time. In cases of complete resection, most patients were not given adjuvant therapy but were expectantly managed by close monitoring using serial imaging and by receiving immediate treatment for tumor recurrence. The overall recurrence rate for expectantly managed tumors was 9% over 28.2 months, and 75% of recurrences responded to delayed radiation therapy.

2531,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded
3059,"[Sellar fibrosarcoma following radiotherapy for prolactinoma] A 51-year-old house woman visited the Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Hospital for examination of the head injury on Oct. 7, 1975. Neurological examination was normal. Endocrinological examination showed galactorrhea. The patient had a past history of premature menopause. Plain skull films revealed enlargement of sella turcica and CT scan showed sellar tumor with suprasellar expansion which was enhanced by contrast medium. The serum prolactin (PRL) level was 3,290 ng/ml. Diagnosis of PRL secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma) was made. Though surgical removal of the tumor was recommended, it was refused by the patient. Therefore, careful observation was continued as an out-patient until May 1979 when she noticed a temporal hemianopsia of her left eye. She was admitted and had partial removal of the tumor via frontal route and subsequent irradiation (total dose of 5,000 rad by Lineac). The tumor was verified to be a prolactinoma by the immunohistochemical staining. Postoperative course was uneventful and she lead a normal life. In Oct. 1981, severe faceache began and she was readmitted. Sella was destructed extensively and CT scan revealed a hugh sellar tumor with multi-directional extrasellar extension which was less enhanced than that of the first study. The serum PRL level was 588 ng/ml and the regrowth of prolactinoma was suspected. High dose bromocriptine (40 mg/day) therapy was started. The serum PRL level rapidly fell to the negligible value, however, shrinkage of the tumor was not observed. On Jan. 20, 1982, suddenly she developed a left hemiparesis and her level of consciousness gradually deteriorated. On Mar. 11, 1982, the second operation was performed and a solid firm tumor in the base of the skull was partially removed. The tumor was histologically verified to be a fibrosarcoma. After the second operation bromocriptine therapy was discontinued, however expected elevation of the serum PRL level was not recognized. She died on Apr. 4, 1982.",Excluded
3577,"810nm near-infrared light offers neuroprotection and improves locomotor activity in MPTP-treated mice We explored whether 810nm near-infrared light (NIr) offered neuroprotection and/or improvement in locomotor activity in an acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Mice received MPTP and 810nm NIr treatments, or not, and were tested for locomotive activity in an open-field test. Thereafter, brains were aldehyde-fixed and processed for tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that MPTP-treated mice that were irradiated with 810nm NIr had both greater locomotor activity (~40%) and number of dopaminergic cells (~20%) than those that were not. In summary, 810nm (as with 670nm) NIr offered neuroprotection and improved locomotor activity in MPTP-treated mice.",Excluded
3436,"Incidence and management of late adverse radiation effects after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery Background: Late adverse radiation effects (ARE) typically occur many years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). They are characterized by perilesional edema or cyst formation and are distinct from radiationinduced changes (RIC) noted in the first 1 to 2 years after AVM SRS and radiation necrosis. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of late ARE after AVM SRS. Method(s): Retrospective review of 233 AVM patients having SRS from 1990 to 2009. Patients had sporadic AVM, no prior radiation, and a minimum of 5 years of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The median MRI follow-up after SRS was 9.8 years (range, 5-24.2). Result(s): Late ARE were observed in 16 patients (6.9%) at a median of 8.7 years after SRS (range, 2.0-16.1). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of late ARE was 0.4%, 7.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Eight patients (3.4%) were symptomatic at the time of ARE detection. Three of 8 patients who were initially asymptomatic had documented cyst progression (at 11, 40, and 42 months), for an overall symptomatic rate of 4.7%. Five patients with asymptomatic ARE have been observed for a median of 9.3 years (range, 2.0-14.1) without progression. Patients having early RIC (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, P < .001), patients having obliteration (HR=1.24, P=.02), and patients having SRS before April 1997 (HR=1.12, P=.02) weremore likely to develop late ARE. Conclusion(s): Late ARE are common in AVM patients who develop early RIC after SRS. Resection of the thrombosed AVM and the adjacent damaged tissue is effective at eliminating the mass effect and improving patients' neurological condition.

3434,"Stereotactic radiosurgery: The preferred management for patients with nonvestibular schwannomas? Purpose: To review patient outcomes after radiosurgery of nonvestibular schwannomas. Methods and Materials: From April 1992 to February 2000, 23 patients had radiosurgery at our center for nonvestibular schwannomas. Affected cranial nerves included the trochlear (n = 1), trigeminal (n = 10), jugular foramen region (n = 10), and hypoglossal (n = 2). Nine patients had undergone one or more prior tumor resections. One patient had a malignant schwannoma; 2 patients had neurofibromatosis. The median prescription isodose volume was 8.9 cc (range, 0.2 to 17.6 cc). The median tumor margin dose was 18 Gy (range, 12 to 20 Gy); the median maximum dose was 36 Gy (range, 24 to 40 Gy). The median follow-up after radiosurgery was 43 months (range, 12 to 111 months). Result(s): Twenty-two of 23 tumors (96%) were either smaller (n = 12) or unchanged in size (n = 10) after radiosurgery. One patient with a malignant schwannoma had tumor progression outside the irradiated volume despite having both radiosurgery and fractionated radiation therapy (50.4 Gy); he died 4 years later. Morbidity related to radiosurgery occurred in 4 patients (17%). Three of 10 patients with trigeminal schwannomas suffered new or worsened trigeminal dysfunction after radiosurgery. One patient with a hypoglossal schwannoma had eustachian tube dysfunction after radiosurgery. No patient with a lower cranial nerve schwannoma developed any hearing loss, facial weakness, or swallowing difficulty after radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): Although the reported number of patients having radiosurgery for nonvestibular schwannomas is limited, the high tumor control rates demonstrated after vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery should apply to these rare tumors. Compared to historical controls treated with surgical resection, radiosurgery appears to have less treatment-associated morbidity for nonvestibular schwannomas, especially for schwannomas involving the lower cranial nerves. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

We aimed to assess the feasibility, tolerability and safety of hyperthermia treatment in a Radiation Oncology Department. Method(s): Between June 2015 and June 2017, 106 patients and a total of 159 tumor lesions were included in a prospective study (EudraCT 2018-001089-40) of HT concomitant with radiotherapy (RT). Systemic treatment was accepted. HT was given twice a week, 60 min per session, during RT treatment by a regional capacitive device (HY-DEEP 600WM system) at 13.56 MHz radiofrequency. Result(s): Most lesions (138 cases, 86.8%) received all HT sessions planned. Thirteen lesions (12 patients) withdrew treatment due to grade >=3 QMHT toxicity. All these 12 patients completed the prescribed radiotherapy and/or systemic treatment.

The frequency of each detected variant was determined in the French population by either a mass spectrometry-based technique or variant-specific endonuclease digestion.RESULTS: Twenty-one ATM missense alterations, at 10 different sites, 8 of which would result in an amino acid substitution at a conserved position in the ATM protein were found. Four were novel changes, three of which were not detected in the 128 French control subjects screened. Eleven of 16 of the individuals with either idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy or juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis and 6 of 14 individuals that had choroidal telangiectasis after radiotherapy for AMD carried ATM sequence variants. These latter six individuals had a significantly shorter delay time before the presentation of this vasculopathy compared with those individuals who had a wild-type ATM (11.8 +/- 3.4 months vs. 17.5 +/- 4.5 months, P = 0.024). They had also received a lower average dose of X-rays, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (18.7 +/- 3.9 Gy vs. 23.7 +/- 5.6 Gy, P = 0.09).CONCLUSIONS: ATM missense variants could confer an AT-like phenotype and influence the formation of retinal and choroidal vascular abnormalities.",Excluded
2956,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it.",Included
3011,"Nuclear matrix associated DNA is preferentially repaired in normal human fibroblasts, exposed to a low dose of ultraviolet light but not in Cockayne's syndrome fibroblasts In this study we addressed the questions as to whether repair is confined to the nuclear matrix compartment, analogous to replication and transcription and how repair events are distributed in DNA loops associated with the nuclear matrix. Pulse labelling of ultraviolet (254 nm) irradiated confluent human fibroblasts revealed that repair was preferentially located in nuclear matrix associated DNA in cells exposed to 5 J/m2. However, in cells exposed to 30 J/m2 repair approached a random distribution. The non-random distribution of repair label at 5 J/m2 was most pronounced directly after irradiation and gradually changed to a more random distribution within two hours after treatment. The results of pulse-chase experiments exclude the possibility of transient binding of repair sites to the matrix and favour the model of preferential repair of DNA sequences permanently associated with the nuclear matrix. Pronounced differences in distribution pattern of repair events in DNA loops were found among normal and UV-sensitive cell lines exposed to 5 J/m2. Repair in nuclear matrix associated DNA was 1.7 fold more efficient than in loop DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group D cells and over 3 fold in xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells. In Cockayne's syndrome fibroblasts repair in nuclear matrix DNA was found to be 2 fold less efficient than in loop DNA. This heterogeneity in distribution of repair correlates well with preferential removal of pyrimidine dimers from transcriptionally active DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells and its absence in Cockayne's syndrome cells as recently reported by Mayne et al., 1988. The results suggest that Cockayne's syndrome cells have a defect in excision of UV-damage from transcriptionally active genes located proximal to the nuclear matrix. Xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells may possess a defect in DNA repair associated with chromatin regions outside transcriptionally active DNA.",Excluded
3504,"Effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation on contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus The space radiation environment contains high-energy charged particles such as <sup>56</sup>Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to hippocampal function in astronauts during and after the mission(s). The mechanisms underlying impairments in cognition are not clear but might involve alterations in the percentage of neurons in the dentate gyrus expressing the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Previously, we showed effects of cranial <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation on hippocampus-dependent contextual freezing and on the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed, but not free, blade. Because it is unclear whether whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation causes similar effects on these markers of hippocampal function, in the present study we quantified the effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation (600MeV, 0.5 or 1Gy) on hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent cognitive performance and determined whether these effects were associated with changes in Arc expression in the enclosed and free blades of the dentate gyrus. Whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation impacted contextual but not cued fear freezing and the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In addition, in mice irradiated with 0.5Gy, contextual freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed blade. In mice tested for cued freezing, there was no correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In contrast, cued freezing in the presence or absence of aversive stimuli correlated with Arc-positive cells in the free blade. In addition, in mice irradiated with 1Gy cued freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive neurons in the free blade. These data indicate that while whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation affects contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, the enclosed blade might be more important for contextual freezing while the free blade might be more important for cued freezing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Included

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of structured exercise with the jaw-mobilizing device TheraBite on trismus, trismus-related symptomatology, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with head and neck cancer. Fifteen patients with trismus (maximum interincisal opening [MIO] <=35 mm) after oncologic treatment for head and neck cancer, underwent a 10-week exercise program with the TheraBite device and were followed regularly. Time between oncologic treatment and start of TheraBite exercise ranged from 0.7 to 14.8 years (average 6.2 years). MIO, trismus-related symptoms, and HRQL was assessed before and after exercise and after 6 months. A significant improvement in MIO was observed post-exercise (3.5 mm, 15.3%, p = 0.0002) and after 6-month of follow-up (4.7 mm, 22.1%, p = 0.0029). A statistically significant correlation was found between increased MIO and fewer trismus-related symptoms.

3399,"Treg/Tcon Immunotherapy and High Dose Marrow Irradiation Ensure Full Control of Leukemia Relapse in Haploidentical Transplantation Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most powerful therapy for patients with high risk of relapse. In spite of that, no matter the donor source or conditioning regimen used, leukemia relapse is still the leading cause of HSCT failure. In HLA-haploidentical HSCT, we recently applied a clinical protocol consisting of total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen and a peripheral blood CD34+ cell graft combined with the adoptive transfer of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and conventional T cells (Tcons). No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. Such protocol was associated with low GvHD and relapse rate (Martelli et al., Blood 2014). To further reduce leukemia relapse in Treg/Tcon-based haploidentical HSCT (Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT) we used high dose hyper-fractionated TBI (HF-TBI) in the conditioning regimen. We also extended Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT to patients that are unfit (because of previous comorbidities) and/or too old to withstand high intensity regimens. In these patients the extra-hematologic toxicity of irradiation was reduced with the use of targeted total marrow and lymph node irradiation (TMLI). 40 patients with high risk acute leukemia (36 AML, 4 ALL) received Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT. All but 3 patients were transplanted in complete remission. 12 younger patients (median age: 28, range: 20-43) received HF-TBI, while 28 older or unfit patients (59, 40-70) received TMLI in the conditioning regimen. HF-TBI (14.4 Gy) was administered in 12 fractions, 3 times a day for 4 days. TMLI was administered by means of Helical Tomotherapy HI-ART (9 fractions, 2 times a day for 4.5 days). Irradiation was followed by chemotherapy with Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Cyclophosphamide. 2 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg freshly isolated CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs were transferred 4 days before the infusion of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg Tcons and a mega-dose of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. 38/40 patients engrafted. 12 (31%) developed aGvHD grade 32 (10 are alive and off-therapy). 6 (16%) died because of transplant related complications (2 because of aGvHD, 2 infections, 1 veno-occlusive disease, 1 intracranial hemorrhage). Strikingly, despite the high risk diseases, no patient relapsed after a median follow up of 13 months (range 1-36, Fig. A). Further, only 1 patient developed cGvHD. Thus, cGvHD/Leukemia-free survival was 82% (Fig. B). Treg adoptive transfer allows for the safe infusion of an otherwise lethal dose of donor alloreactive Tcons in the absence of any other form of immune suppression. Our results demonstrate that the potent graft versus leukemia effect of Treg/Tcon adoptive transfer was boosted by high dose marrow irradiation. Thus, this study proves that the right combination of haploidentical Treg/Tcon immunotherapy plus a powerful conditioning regimen can fully eradicate leukemia. Copyright © 2018",Excluded
3351,"Magnetic resonance imaging associates with differences in neurocognitive performance for cancer survivors complaining of cognitive deficits following brain irradiation BACKGROUND: Following brain irradiation, roughly 50% of cancer survivors develop some higher-order neurocognitive impairment that does not resolve and can decline further into dementia. However, predicting those who will develop cognitive impairment following therapy is not currently possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers from clinical scans may provide candidate biomarkers related to cognitive performance. METHOD(S): Baseline MRI scans and neurocognitive scores were collected from 198 participants enrolled in CCWFU91105 (NCT#00369785) prior to randomization. Subjects self-reported cognitive difficulties and were at least 6 months post-therapy. At minimum, a T1-weighted MRI pre- and post-gadolinium contrast was requested to confirm stable disease in all participants. Additional scans, including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and T2-weighted MRI scans, were available for analysis in subgroups of participants. Significance was assessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) with a family-wise error correction of p < 0.05. RESULT(S): Because of the vast variability in scan protocols, consistent whole-brain imaging (ie, no skip) was found in 50% of post-contrast T1-weighted scans. From these, local gray and white matter volumes were determined. Increased processing speed was associated with increased volume of white matter in the Muratoff bundle (i.e., subcallosal fasciculus), whereas increased verbal fluency was associated with increased white matter in the corpus callosum, left frontal horn, and bilateral cerebellum. Subgroup analysis of other modality scans (as available: FLAIR and diffusion-weighted) supported these findings. Perfusion of gray matter did not correlate with neurocognitive function in the sub-group receiving pulse arterial spin labeling scans. CONCLUSION(S): Variance in brain structure correlated with performance differences on several neurocognitive tests and indicated a strong association between white matter integrity and maintenance of cognitive function in cancer survivors following brain irradiation. Whether a prospective trial from a pretreatment baseline will find white matter integrity to be predictive of postradiotherapy cognitive function remains to be seen.",Excluded
3325,"""Low-intensity laser therapy effect on the recovery of traumatic spinal cord injury"" Scientific advances have been made to optimize the healing process in spinal cord injury. Studies have been developed to obtain effective treatments in controlling the secondary injury that occurs after spinal cord injury, which substantially changes the prognosis. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been applied in neuroscience due to its anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissue in the repairing process. Few studies have been made associating LILT to the spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the LILT (GaAlAs laser-780 nm) on the locomotor functional recovery, histomorphometric, and histopathological changes of the spinal cord after moderate traumatic injury in rats (spinal cord injury at T9 and T10). Thirty-one adult Wistar rats were used, which were divided into seven groups: control without surgery (n = 3), control surgery (n = 3), laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5), medullar lesion (n = 5) without phototherapy, medullar lesion + laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), and medullar lesion + laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5). The assessment of the motor function was performed using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and adapted Sciatic Functional Index (aSFI). The assessment of urinary dysfunction was clinically performed. After 21 days postoperative, the animals were euthanized for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the spinal cord. The results showed faster motor evolution in rats with spinal contusion treated with LILT, maintenance of the effectiveness of the urinary system, and preservation of nerve tissue in the lesion area, with a notorious inflammation control and increased number of nerve cells and connections. In conclusion, positive effects on spinal cord recovery after moderate traumatic spinal cord injury were shown after LILT.",Excluded
2966,"Autofluorescence spectroscopy as a proxy for chronic white matter pathology Background: The balance of tissue injury and repair ultimately determines outcomes of chronic neurological disorders, such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the extent of pathology can be difficult to detect, particularly when it is insidious and/or offset by tissue regeneration. Objective(s): The objective of this research is to evaluate whether tissue autofluorescence-typically a source of contamination-provides a surrogate marker of white matter injury. Method(s): Tissue autofluorescence in autopsied specimens both experimental and clinical was characterized by spectral confocal microscopy and correlated to severity and chronicity as determined by standard histopathology. Result(s): Months after cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination, despite robust remyelination, autofluorescent deposits progressively accumulated in regions of prior pathology. Autofluorescent deposits (likely reflecting myelin debris remnants) were conspicuously localized to white matter, proportional to lesion severity, and displayed differential fluorescence over time. Strikingly, similar features were apparent also in autopsied MS tissue. Conclusion(s): Autofluorescence spectroscopy illuminates prior and ongoing white matter injury. The accumulation of autofluorescence in proportion to the extent of progressive atrophy, despite robust remyelination in the CPZ brain, provides important proof-of-concept of a phenomenon (insidious ongoing damage masked by mechanisms of tissue repair) that we hypothesize is highly relevant to the progressive phase of MS.

3382,"Fractional anisotropy dose-response relationship of the corpus callosum Purpose or Objective: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive modality for determination of water diffusion properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA) quantifies the extent of directionality of water diffusion. We investigated absorbed dose as a predictor of FA change in the corpus callosum (CC) following radiation therapy for high grade glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with high-grade glioma underwent DTI scans before, and ten months after radiation therapy to 59.4-60 Gy. Diffusion data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Using an automated white matter fiber tracking technique, 23 fiber tracts were segmented on the baseline and follow-up DTI images. The CT images used for treatment planning and both DTI image sets were aligned using non-linear registration. This way, the baseline FA, the follow-up FA, and the absorbed dose could be determined for each voxel in all 15 patients. For each voxel in the CC, we calculated the FA change as FA follow-up /FA baseline and dichotomized the data into a binary outcome variable using 0.5 as cutoff. For all 15 patients, logistic regression was used to determine dose-response curve parameters (D50 and g50) and their confidence intervals (CIs). We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminative ability of the voxel dose. Then, we estimated dose-response curve parameters and calculated the AUC for each patient individually. Result(s): The median age was 59 (range: 40-85) years. The average CC volume and average CC mean absorbed dose was 62+/-8 cm3 and 26+/-14 Gy (1 SD), respectively. Using data from 99 691 voxels, the estimated parameters for the doseresponse curve for all patients (upper panel in Figure 1) were D50=88.0+/-0.1 Gy and gamma50=0.80+/-0.01 (95% CIs). The AUC was 0.71 indicating good discriminative ability. For nine out of 15 patients, the individual AUC was >=0.60, indicating that higher absorbed dose is associated with higher probability of FA change >=0.5. Dose -response curves for those patients are shown in the lower panel in Figure 1 and their estimated parameter values in Table 1. Individual D50s varied between 41.3 and 125.9 Gy. Conclusion(s): Absorbed dose was a significant predictor of FA change in the CC. This was the case both when all patients were pooled for analysis, and in nine out of 15 patients when analyzed separately. More detailed analyses are needed to better understand the effect radiation has on water diffusion in brain white matter. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

2728,"Anti-emetic effect of ondansetron and granisetron after exposure to mixed neutron and gamma irradiation The anti-emetic efficiency of orally administered ondansetron and granisetron has been tested in macaques exposed to a mixed y and neutron radiation (6 Gy) with a high neutron/gamma-ray ratio. Our experiments reveal that a single delivery of ondansetron (1 or 2 mg kg(-1)) or of granisetron (0.25 mg kg(-1)) 45-90 min before irradiation or 35-45 min after irradiation was not totally effective. Conversely, the delivery of two doses with the same delay prior to and after exposure led to a complete prevention of vomiting and retching. These observations can be explained by the dual mechanism of radiation-induced emesis: an early peripheral mechanism and a later central mechanism. Two deliveries of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists seem to disrupt serotonergic transmission at the brain stem structures and to affect the peripheral release of serotonin from the gut, thus completely preventing radiation-induced vomiting. This study confirms that the 5-HT3-dependent mechanisms that mediate emesis are similar for both neutron and gamma radiation.",Excluded
3357,"YKL-40 expression is associated with poorer response to radiation and shorter overall survival in glioblastoma PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included

Although this may be true in some cases, the middle and inner ear contain rich networks of other sensitive structures that are at risk after radiotherapy and that may contribute to toxicity afterward. We reviewed the limited reported data regarding radiation tolerance of external, middle, and inner ear structures, and perspectives for therapy with gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery are addressed.

2774,"Radiotherapy management of brain metastases using conventional linear accelerator BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As treatments for primary cancers continue to improve life expectancy, unfortunately, brain metastases also appear to be constantly increasing and life expectancy for patients with brain metastases is low. Longer survival and improved quality of life may be achieved using localised radiological and surgical approaches in addition to low dose corticosteroids. Stereotactic brain radiotherapy is one rapidly evolving localized radiation treatment. This article describes our experience with stereotactic radiotherapy using a linear accelerator.METHODS: We reviewed patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, from the time of its introduction into daily practice in our Department of Oncology in 2014. We collected the data on patient treatment and predicted survival based on prognostic indices and actual patient outcome.RESULTS: A total of 10 patients were treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, in one case in combination with whole brain radiotherapy and hippocampal sparing. There was no significant treatment related toxicity during the treatment or follow-up and due to the small number of fractions, the overall tolerance of the treatment was excellent. The patient intrafractional movement in all cases was under 1 mm suggesting that 1 mm margin around the CTV to create the PTV is sufficient and also that patient immobilization using the thermoplastic mask compared with invasive techniques, is feasible. We also found that prognostic indices such as the Graded Prognostic Assessment provide accurate predictions of patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our current evidence, patients with brain metastases fit enough, should be considered for stereotactic radiotherapy treatment.",Excluded
3542,"Assessment of MRI-based attenuation correction for MRI-only radiotherapy treatment planning of the brain Magnetic resonance imaging-only radiotherapy treatment planning (MRI-only RTP) and positron emission tomography (PET)-MRI imaging require generation of synthetic computed tomography (sCT) images from MRI images. In this study, initial dosimetric evaluation was performed for a previously developed MRI-based attenuation correction (MRAC) method for use in MRI-only RTP of the brain. MRAC-based sCT images were retrospectively generated from Dixon MR images of 20 patients who had previously received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Bone segmentation performance and Dice similarity coefficient of the sCT conversion method were evaluated for bone volumes on CT images. Dose calculation accuracy was assessed by recalculating the CT-based EBRT plans using the sCT images as the base attenuation data. Dose comparison was done for the sCTand CT-based EBRT plans in planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). Parametric dose comparison showed mean relative differences of <0.4% for PTV and <1.0% for OARs. Mean gamma index pass rates of 95.7% with the 2%/2 mm agreement criterion and 96.5% with the 1%/1 mm agreement criterion were determined for glioma and metastasis patients, respectively. Based on the results, MRI-only RTP using sCT images generated from MRAC images can be a feasible alternative for radiotherapy of the brain. Copyright © 2020 by the authors.",Excluded
3327,"Controversies in the management of intracranial germinomas Intracranial germinomas are uncommon tumors. In the past, patients have traditionally been diagnosed with a trial of focal radiotherapy without biopsy. If the tumor was radiosensitive, it was presumed to be a germinoma. Because of the minimal morbidity and mortality associated with microsurgical techniques, almost all patients now have a histologic diagnosis and can be treated appropriately. Radiation therapy has been employed for the past three decades in the curative management of this disease. The long-term results have been excellent; however, current approaches have explored the possibility of reducing or even eliminating radiation therapy. This article provides a brief overview of intracranial germinomas and explores the controversies in the surgical, radiotherapeutic, and chemotherapeutic management of this tumor.",Excluded
2508,"Pyruvate kinase and aspartate-glutamate carrier distributions reveal key metabolic links between neurons and glia in retina Symbiotic relationships between neurons and glia must adapt to structures, functions, and metabolic roles of the tissues they are in. We show here that Muller glia in retinas have specific enzyme deficiencies that can enhance their ability to synthesize Gln. The metabolic cost of these deficiencies is that they impair the Muller cell's ability to metabolize Glc. We show here that the cells can compensate for this deficiency by using metabolites produced by neurons. Muller glia are deficient for pyruvate kinase (PK) and for aspartate/glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1), a key component of the malate-aspartate shuttle. In contrast, photoreceptor neurons express AGC1 and the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, which is commonly associated with aerobic glycolysis in tumors, proliferating cells, and some other cell types. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified type of metabolic relationship between neurons and glia. Muller glia compensate for their unique metabolic adaptations by using lactate and aspartate from neurons as surrogates for their missing PK and AGC1.",Excluded
2788,"Long-term safety of single and multiple infrared transcranial laser treatments in Sprague-Dawley rats BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Growing interest exists in the use of near-infrared laser therapies for the treatment of numerous neurologic conditions, including acute ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. In consideration of these trends, the objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of transcranial laser therapy with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared laser light (wavelength, 808 +/- 10 nm, 2-mm diameter) with a nominal radiant power of 70 mW; power density, 2,230 mW/cm(2), and energy density, 268 J/cm(2) at the scalp (10 mW/cm(2) and 1.2 J/cm(2) at the cerebral cortical surface) in healthy Sprague-Dawley rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 120 anesthetized rats received sequential transcranial laser treatments to the right and left parietal areas of the head on the same day (minimum of 5 min between irradiation of each side), on either Day 1 or on each of Days 1, 3, and 5. Sixty anesthetized rats served as sham controls. Rats were evaluated 1 year after treatment for abnormalities in clinical hematology and brain and pituitary gland histopathology.RESULTS: No toxicologically important differences were found in the clinical hematology results between sham-control and laser-treated rats for any hematologic parameters examined. All values fell within historic control reference ranges for aged Sprague-Dawley rats. Similarly, brain and pituitary gland histopathology showed no treatment-related abnormalities or induced neoplasia.CONCLUSIONS: Single and multiple applications of transcranial laser therapy with 808-nm CW laser light at a nominal power density of 10 mW/cm(2) at the surface of the cerebral cortex appears to be safe in Sprague-Dawley rats 1 year after treatment.",Excluded
2880,"Routine use of approximately 60 Gy once-daily thoracic irradiation for patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer PURPOSE: To review the outcome of patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer receiving daily thoracic irradiation (RT) to approximately 60 Gy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of patients treated with RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer between 1991 and 1999 at Duke University were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-five patients were identified who had received continuous course once-daily 1.8-2 Gy fractions to approximately 60 Gy (range 58-66). All patients received chemotherapy (CHT); 32 received concurrent RT/CHT and 33 sequential CHT and then RT. Prophylactic cranial RT was administered to 17 patients. The time from diagnosis to local failure, tumor progression, and death was assessed using actuarial methods. The median follow-up for all patients was 16.7 months and for surviving patients was 29.6 months. The median age was 64 years (range 36-83), and the median Karnofsky performance status was 80 (range 50-100).RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial rate of local failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 40%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. One case of acute Grade 3 esophagitis developed. Ten late complications occurred: four pulmonary, two esophageal, two infectious, one leukemia, and one retinal toxicity with prophylactic cranial RT. Six were mild and resolved with treatment.CONCLUSION: CHT plus approximately 60 Gy of once-daily RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer was generally well tolerated. The survival rates were less than have been reported using 45 Gy in 1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions (2-year overall survival rate 47% compared with 30% in this study), but may be comparable because fewer than one-half our patients received concurrent CHT/RT and only 26% received prophylactic cranial RT. The relatively low rate of normal tissue morbidity in our patients supports the use of conventional once-daily fractionation to > or = 60 Gy. A randomized trial would be required to compare the outcomes after maximally tolerated dose twice-daily RT vs. maximally tolerated dose daily RT.",Excluded
2935,Neuromuscular toxicity of therapy The peripheral nervous system is frequently impaired in patients who have cancer. This impairment often results from toxicity of treatment but may also be due to direct invasion by tumor or may be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. This review summarizes the recent literature regarding peripheral neuropathies and myopathies that are seen in patients with cancer. Highlights include the neuromuscular toxicity of some of the newer chemotherapeutic agents and immune mediators such as taxol and interleukin-2; a discussion of some of the agents being investigated for chemoprotection and rescue; an assessment of the evidence supporting the concept of motor neuron disease as a paraneoplastic disorder; and an interesting case report of megakaryoblastic leukemia invading peripheral nerves.

3220,"CT evaluation of patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding: how precisely can patients reproduce the tumor position in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices? The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reproducibility of tumor position under patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices, as well as to compare the reproducibility of deep inspiration self-breath-holding on the verbal command of a radiation technologist (Passive mode) with that initiated by patients' own estimation (Active mode). Twenty patients with lung cancer were shown how the tumor and diaphragm move during the respiration cycle. Patients were instructed to hold their breath during deep inspiration and reproduce identical tumor position as well as possible either by the Active mode or by the Passive mode. After patients had practiced self-breath-holding during deep inspiration, a set of three CT scans was obtained for each of the two modes of self-breath-holding (6 CT scans total) to obtain randomly timed images of 2 mm thickness in the vicinity of the tumor. The first three scans were performed during breath-hold using the Active mode, and next three scans were using the Passive mode. Maximum difference in tumor position for the three CT scans was then calculated along three axes: cranial-caudal (C-C); anterior-posterior (A-P); and right-left (R-L). In the 20 patients who underwent analysis of self-breath-holding, mean maximum difference in tumor position obtained under breath-hold using the Active and the Passive modes were: 2.2 and 3.1 mm along the C-C axis; 1.4 and 2.4 mm along the A-P axis; and 1.3 and 2.2 mm along the R-L axis, respectively. These differences in all axes were significantly smaller (p<0.05) for the Active mode than for the Passive mode. Most tumors displayed maximal respiratory movement along the C-C axis, and minimal movement along the R-L axis, but tumors located in the upper lung displayed maximal movement along the A-P axis. Significant correlation (p<0.05) was observed between differences along three axes in either mode of breath-hold. In conclusion, the reproducibility of tumor position under self-breath-holding by patients during deep inspiration after sufficient practice and in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices was satisfactorily accurate, and differences in tumor position were smaller under breath-holding using the Active mode than using the Passive mode. We believe this new technique is likely to prove extremely useful for the irradiation of lung tumors with a small internal margin and for reduced proportion of high-dose irradiated normal lung to total lung volume.",Excluded

Patients in the treatment group were administrated pregabalin for 8 weeks combined with rehabilitation, while the control group only received rehabilitation. The clinical therapeutic effects were observed and evaluated by mandibular motion, severity of trismus measured by late effects of normal tissues/subjective and objective medical analysis (LENT/SOMA) scales, and quality of life (QOL) assessed using the World Health Organization QOL instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) at baseline, week 4 and week 8 during treatment in these two groups, respectively.RESULTS: In the treatment group, the number of patients with improvement on maximal vertical dimension (MVD) was significantly more than controls at week 4 and week 8 (P=0.013, P=0.004, respectively). Moreover, at week 4 and week 8, the severity of trismus was both significantly improved on LENT/SOMA grade in treatment group (P=0.047, P=0.032, respectively). And at week 8, the physical health and the whole life domain of the WHOQOL-BREF score were significantly increased (P=0.037, P=0.034, respectively).

2734,"Significant reduction of beta-amyloid in the CNS following external radiation: Implications for treatment in alzheimer's disease Purpose/Objective(s): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly population, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau protein tangles. These events are especially prevalent in the hippocampus region which is responsible for long term memory. In this animal study, we investigated if cranial X-irradiation could reduce the formation of Ab plaques as a potential novel clinical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the rationale being that external beam radiotherapy has been used previously as an effective clinical treatment for systemic amyloidosis. Materials/Methods: A transgenic mouse model was used that expresses a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with early-onset AD. Radiation treatments were either a single dose (5 Gy, 10 Gy or 15 Gy) or daily fractionation (1 Gy, 2 Gy) to a dose of 10 Gy to a single side of the head. Brains were harvested at various times post-irradiation (2-8 wks) and coronal sections were evaluated for H&E and antibody specific immunohistochemistry to detect beta-amyloid plaques and assess radiation response, staining for IL1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, microglia cells (CD11b) and activated microglia cells (CD68). Result(s): Radiation treatments were well-tolerated. H&E stained tissue sections indicated no evidence of a significant decrease in cell density (Nissl staining) and no compelling evidence of significant cellular necrosis. No signs of devitalization, malacia or spongiosus or classic acute or chronic inflammatory features were evident. The number and size of beta-amyloid plaques were compared between the irradiated and shielded halves of the brain. The average number of plaques in the unirradiated brain increased with age, the values for 32, 34 and 38 week old animals were 43.9 (SD +/- 17.6; n = 9), 61.7 (SD +/- 19.8, n = 9) and 109 (SD +/- 26.9, n = 9) respectively. Radiation treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of plaques throughout the brain (paired t-test p = 0.002).This effect was more significant in the hippocampus region (p = 0.0004). At 4 weeks post-treatment 5, 10 and 15 Gy caused a 71 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 24%, 92 +/- 34% reduction in plaque incidence in the hippocampus. The greatest reductions were noted at longer times post-treatment. TGF-beta staining was restricted to the irradiated side of the brain, little or no site-specific staining of IL1 or TNF-alpha was seen. A trend was evident of activated microglia in the irradiated brain. Conclusion(s): We report the first experience that external beam irradiation can produce a significant reduction in beta-amyloid plaques associated with AD.",Excluded
3589,"Cellular response of meningioma towards retinoid acid and ionizing radiation Meningiomas are the second most common primary brain tumors and represent one-third of all primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Currently, most meninigiomas are effectively managed via surgical resection. Recurrent meningiomas and unresectable, residual tumors after partial resection are treated with radiation. However, patients who are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or whose tumors recur after such treatment have limited therapeutic options. Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA) has been widely used to treat dermatological disease. Recently, RA, the active derivative of vitamin A and the first candidate diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, was used as a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of RA on meningiomas when administered in combinination with ionizing radiation. The early data showed that both all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic aciecan inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations (10 mM) but had little cell proliferation inhibition activity at low concentrations (10 nM and 1 mM, respectively), thereby implicating the role of RA in meningioma clinical treatment. Neither ATRA nor 13-cis-RA influenced cell cycle progression. Further study showed that 10-mM ATRA exposure led to increased cell death after irradiation; however, 10-nM or 1-mMATRA pretreatment enhanced meningioma cell survival following irradiation. Comet assay showed that RA reduced the G2/M phase arrest caused by irradiation, thereby suggesting that DNA repair processes are involved in the activity of RA when combined with radiation.",Excluded

Between August 2007 and October 2008, 27 patients with PNS or NC tumors were treated in our department using SRS. Median age was 53 years (range, 27-84 years). Eleven patients were female and sixteen were male. Most common histopathology was SCC (44%). The disease involved the maxillary sinus in 15 patients (55%). SRS was applied to 6 patients (22%) for reirradiation, while the others received it as a primary treatment. Seven patients had SRS as a boost dose to external beam radiotherapy. SRS was delivered with cyberknife (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The median dose to the tumor was 31 Gy (range, 15-37.5 Gy) in median 5 fractions (range, 3-5 fractions). After a median follow-up of 21.4 months (range, 3-59 months), 76% of the patients were free of local relapse. Three patients showed local progression and 3 developed distant metastases. One- and two-year survival rates for the entire group were 95.2% (SEM = 0.046) and 77.1% (SEM = 0.102), respectively. We observed brain necrosis in 2 patients, visual disorder in 2 patients, bone necrosis in 2 patients and trismus in 1 patient as a SRS related late toxicity.

Material(s) and Method(s): This is a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with mild tSAH presenting between January 2017 and July 2019. A total of 101 and 140 patients met the eligibility criteria for the first and second subgroups, respectively. Common inclusion criteria were isolated mild tSAH, Glasgow Coma Scale between 13 and 15, and neurological stability. Additional inclusion criteria for the first subgroup were availability of brain imaging at the outside institution prior to transfer and the second subgroup was the availability of follow-up imaging. Result(s): In the first subgroup, 76.20% of patients had stable SAH, 18.80% had reduced SAH, while 5% had an interval increase in SAH. None required any surgical intervention. Additional per-patient mean radiation exposure was 1.77 +/- 0.26 mSv. In the second subgroup, all 140 patients had complete resolution of tSAH. One patient had a new tiny subdural hemorrhage, which subsequently resolved on follow-up. The additional mean radiation exposure was 2.47 +/- 1.29 mSv. A total of 256 avoidable CT scans were performed resulting in excess health care costs of about US$531 696. Conclusion(s): In neurologically stable isolated tSAH patients, repeat brain imaging during interfacility transfer and inpatient and/or outpatient follow-up do not alter patient management despite increased health care costs and radiation burden.

2805,"The association between white matter abnormalities and processing speed deficits in bipolar disorder Background: Abnormality of white matter (WM) integrity, as measured by fractional anisotrophy (FA) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has been observed in bipolar disorder (BD). However, few studies have examined the relationship of FA with cognitive performance in BD. We used DTI to examine regional differences in FA between BD and healthy comparison (HC) participants and the relationship with processing speed and switching abilities within regions of aberrant WM integrity. Method(s): 20 medicated euthymic BD (age=44.6+/-2.1yrs) and 20 HC (age=45.3+/-1.8yrs) participants completed neuropsychological tests of processing speed and switching (D-KEFS Trailmaking) and a 51-direction DTI scan. FA was calculated and tract-based spatial statistics were used to identify common WM tracts. Group differences were examined with independent-samples T-tests. Within significantly different regions, the association of FA with cognitive performance was examined in each group separately. Result(s): BD patients had lower FA within seven WM regions, including clusters in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left anterior thalamic radiation, and exhibited mildly slower processing speed. Among BD patients, lower FA values within left inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with slower processing speed. There were no significant associations among HC subjects or for switching performance in either group. Conclusion(s): Consistent with the literature, BD patients demonstrated abnormal WM integrity, primarily in the longitudinal fasciculus, and this deficit was most pronounced among BD patients with the slowest processing speed. These findings suggest that BD processing speed deficits may be due to abnormal WM integrity in the longitudinal fasciculus.",Excluded

This matched-pair analysis compared whole-brain irradiation plus radiosurgery (WBI + RS) to neurosurgical resection followed by whole-brain irradiation and a boost to the metastatic site (NR + WBI + B). Method(s): The data of 46 patients treated with WBI + RS were matched 1:1 to 46 patients treated with NR + WBI + B with respect to age, gender, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), tumor type, extracerebral metastases, and interval from first diagnosis of cancer to treatment of the metastasis, RPA class, and GPA score. Both groups were compared for local control of the treated metastasis, intracerebral control, and survival. Result(s): The 1-year local control rates were 85% after WBI + RS and 78% after NR + WBI + B (p = 0.35). The 1-year intracerebral control rates were 74% and 68% (p = 0.33), respectively. The 1-year survival rates were 64% and 58% (p = 0.70), respectively. A multivariate analysis was not performed for local and intracerebral control, because no factor achieved significance on univariate analyses for these endpoints. Improved survival was associated with KPS > 70 (p = 0.032), absence of extracerebral metastases (p = 0.003), RPA-class 1 (p = 0.014), and GPA score of 3.0-4.0 (p = 0.010).

2706,"Robotics in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery: A critical review of existing systems and proposed specifications for new robotic platforms BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in image guidance, endoscopy, and tube-shaft instruments have allowed for the further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times, reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved longterm outcomes, the technical skills required to perform such surgery are inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques, and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance surgical performance. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the role of surgical robots in keyhole transcranial endoscopeassisted microsurgery. METHOD(S): The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of presently available robotic systems was performed. RESULT(S): Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field. CONCLUSION(S): New robotic platforms in minimally invasive neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant clinical penetration.

3468,"Disorder in Pixel-Level Edge Directions on T1WI Is Associated with the Degree of Radiation Necrosis in Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: Preliminary Findings BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (COLLAGE) is a recently developed radiomic (computer extracted) feature that captures entropy (measures the degree of disorder) in pixel-level edge directions and was previously shown to distinguish predominant cerebral radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor on gadolinium-contrast T1WI. In this work, we sought to investigate whether COLLAGE measurements from posttreatment gadolinium-contrast T1WI could distinguish varying extents of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor classes in a lesion across primary and metastatic brain tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: On a total of 75 gadolinium-contrast T1WI studies obtained from patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the extent of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor in every brain lesion was histopathologically defined by an expert neuropathologist as the following: 1) ""pure"" cerebral radiation necrosis; 2) ""mixed"" pathology with coexistence of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumors; 3) ""predominant"" (>80%) cerebral radiation necrosis; 4) predominant (>80%) recurrent tumor; and 5) pure tumor. COLLAGE features were extracted from the expert-annotated ROIs on MR imaging. Statistical comparisons of COLLAGE measurements using first-order statistics were performed across pure, mixed, and predominant pathologies of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: COLLAGE features exhibited decreased skewness for patients with pure (0.15 +/- 0.12) and predominant cerebral radiation necrosis (0.25 +/- 0.09) and were statistically significantly different (P < .05) from those in patients with predominant recurrent tumors, which had highly skewed (0.42 +/- 0.21) COLLAGE values. COLLAGE values for the mixed pathology studies were found to lie between predominant cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor categories.CONCLUSIONS: With additional independent multisite validation, COLLAGE measurements might enable noninvasive characterization of the degree of recurrent tumor or cerebral radiation necrosis in gadolinium-contrast T1WI of posttreatment lesions.",Excluded
3084,"Clinical applications and basic studies of laser in dentistry and oral surgery In our clinical use of lasers, mainly CO2 laser for oral surgery, we found that the laser had many advantages over an electrome and the laser improved the local control rate for malignant tumors. Low-power laser has been used to treat hypersensitive dentin, to relieve pain caused by neurotic disease around mouth, and to promote the healing of those diseases. The results obtained from the clinical applications showed that irradiation of the hypersensitive dentin with low-power laser was significantly effective in desensitization. An in vitro study showed no effects of diode or He-Ne laser irradiation on the growth of cells, but showed changes in the initial cell adhesion rate. He-Ne laser irradiation to the wound in the skin of hamsters caused to change the activities of the types I and III collagenase. This fact suggest that laser irradiation acted to promote the healing of wound.",Excluded
3650,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation.",Included

Method(s): The trypan blue was used to examine cell viability before and after treatment, and real time PCR to analyze the expression of microRNAs in time 0h (immediately after treatments), and 48h after the exposure to treatments. Result(s): The analysis of cell viability showed no statistically significant difference among the studied groups. The oncogene miR-21 demonstrated a significantly higher expression in neurospheres in group treated with ionizing radiation (both 0h and 48h). The tumor suppressors microRNAs miR-15 and miR-16 had no significant expression among cell types and treatments modalities submissions. However, miR-15 and miR-16 had a considerably different expression between the analyzed periods: miR-15 in the time 0h was highly expressed in adherent cells treated with ionizing radiation and temozolomide; and, during the 48 hour analysis, miR-15 was more expressed in neurospheres with the same type of treatment. The same expression profile happened with the miR-16, however being more expressed in the group treated with ionizing radiation. Conclusion(s): MicroRNAs studied in glioblastoma cell line culture demonstrated differentially expressions when compared neurospheres and adhered cells and different treatments. MiR-21 expression was significantly different between cell types (neurospheres and adhered cells), remaining more expressed in neurospheres treated with ionizing radiation.",Excluded

[Polish] The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in the course of Graves' disease. Nineteen patients with neuropathy out of 520 patients with Graves' disease, including 15 women and 4 men were treated. Age of the patients ranged from 36 to 69 years, mean age was 51.3. In all patients thyroid function was normalized, 4 patients underwent strumectomy. Bi- and unilateral neuropathy was found in 13 and 6 cases respectively. The therapy consisted of high-dose steroids (Prednisone in 12 cases or Dexamethasone i.v. in 3 cases) or they were combined with gamma cobalt-60 irradiation of orbit tissues (2000 c Gy in 10 fractions) in 8 cases. In 2 cases radiotherapy alone was performed. Two cases were excluded from treatment because of optic atrophy during the first examination. In all patients full ophthalmological investigation, ultrasonography and computed tomography of the orbit before and after the treatment were performed. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 46 months, mean 21.4. Improvement of visual acuity and perimetry (p < 0.05) after the treatment was observed and changes of the fundus after the treatment were significantly (p = 0.000) improved. Exophthalmos significantly decreased (p < 0.05) but only in the right eye. In all patients the therapy reduced the ophthalmopathy index from mean 7.5 to 4.1 (p = 0.000). In conclusion: 1. Early diagnosis and appropriate, constant conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease prevent from blindness and surgical intervention. 2. Corticotherapy in combination with radiotherapy of the orbit is a beneficial method of the treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease.",Excluded
2739,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and alzheimer's disease Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy age-matched controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Rates of decline were -0.028 FA units per year in FTLD in the genu of the CC, and -0.017 FA units per year in AD in splenium of the CC. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded
3629,"Stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery as an effective treatment for acromegaly INTRODUCTION: Pituitary tumors causing acromegaly are treated primarily by surgical resection. If not curative, further treatment is needed. 'Gamma Knife' stereotactic radiosurgery enables single fraction delivery of highly focused radiation to a pituitary target. Aim(s): To assess the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery for acromegaly. METHOD(S): Data was retrospectively collected from 35 patients in eight regional centers, via the UK National Acromegaly Register. All patients had neurosurgery and a Perfexion Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm) was used for radiosurgery at one institution (Sheffield, UK). The mean peak dose was 53 Gy. RESULT(S): Biochemical: Of thirty-five patients, 66% achieved a normal age and sex-adjusted IGF-1 atmedian follow up of 65months after gamma knife. Of thirty-two patients tested, 72% achieved controlled (<2.5ug/L) nadir GH level, median follow up of 60 months; of these patients 35%(n=8) were also receivingmedical therapy. Themean IGF-1 before and after gamma knife was 777 ug/L and 436 ug/L, respectively (p = 0.015). Mean GH level before gamma knife in 24 patients was 5.62 ug/L and after was 1.25 ug/L (p = 0.0051). The probability of control of IGF-1 and GH levels did not correlate with dose of radiation delivered. Radiological: Post gamma knife MRI demonstrated pituitary tumor size unchanged or reduced in 100%of 24 patients atmedian followup of 50.5months.

3235,"Optimal arc selection from class solution geometries for solitary intra-cranial radiotherapy Objectives: Preliminary planning at our institution using HyperArcTM (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) identified the optimal beam energy of 10 MVFFF. Evidence suggests that single target plans do not require as many arcs as single isocentre, multiple target plans but there are trade-offs.1,2 The aim of this study was to determine the optimal arc selection from HyperArcs class solution beam geometries for post-surgical cavities for stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Method(s): For 16 retrospective solitary post-surgical cavity cases, HyperArc plans comprising different arc geometries were generated. Prescribed dose for all plans was 24 Gy in 3 fractions with D99% >= utilising 10 MVFFF. Metrics analysed including indices: CI100 RTOG, CI50 RTOG, CI Paddick, GI Paddick, HI (ICRU 83) and plan complexity using modulation factor (MF) (MU/dose per fraction in cGy) comparing default arc selection versus varying arc selections. Result(s): The mean CI100 RTOG for default arc selection was 1.10 (1.03-1.25) compared to 1.11 (1.05-1.24) for the comparison plans. The mean CI50 RTOG for default arc selection was 3.24 (2.70-5.44) compared to 3.25 (2.79-4.46) for the comparison plans. The mean MF for default arc selection was 2.74 (2.40-3.40) compared to 2.76 (2.40-4.00) for the comparison plans. Results from the complete analysis to be presented with additional metrics. Discussion/Conclusion: Analysis highlighted minimal differences when comparing default arc selection to varying arc selection. Due to no clear benefit for either groups of plans, consideration in the decision making was given to both treatment time and isocentre verification at individual couch angles. Therefore, minimising arc angles for solitary intra-cranial lesions was the preferred option.",Excluded
3576,"Type-specific photoreceptor loss in pigeons after disruption of parasympathetic control of choroidal blood flow by the medial subdivision of the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal The medial part of the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal (EWM) in birds mediates light-regulated adaptive increases in choroidal blood flow (ChBF). We sought to characterize the effect of loss of EWM-mediated ChBF regulation on photoreceptor health in pigeons housed in either moderate intensity diurnal or constant light (CL). Photoreceptor abundance following complete EWM destruction was compared to that following a lesion in the pupil control circuit (as a control for spread of EWM lesions to the nearby pupil-controlling lateral EW) or following no EW damage. Birds were housed post-lesion in a 12 h 400 lux light/12 h dark light cycle for up to 16.5 months, or in constant 400 lux light for up to 3 weeks. Paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixed eyes were embedded in plastic, sectioned, slide-mounted, and stained with toluidine blue/azure II. Blinded analysis of photoreceptor outer segment abundance was performed, with outer segment types distinguished by oil droplet tint and laminar position. Brains were examined histologically to assess lesion accuracy. Disruption of pupil control had no adverse effect on photoreceptor outer segment abundance in either diurnal light or CL, but EWM destruction led to 50-60% loss of blue/violet cone outer segments in both light conditions, and a 42% loss of principal cone outer segments in CL. The findings indicate that adaptive regulation of ChBF by the EWM circuit plays a role in maintaining photoreceptor health and mitigates the harmful effect of light on photoreceptors, especially short wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors.",Excluded
3135,"[The effect of streptokinase on the development of rat cerebral cortex cells in vitro] The aim of this study was to determine the effect of streptokinase (SK) on the ultrastructure of cellular elements in the cerebral cortex of newborn rats in vitro. Three series of cell cultures grown on DMEM were used, including those grown on the medium enriched with 15% fetal calf serum (control 1), cultures transferred to the depleted medium containing only 0.5% of this serum (control 2), and the experimental cultures, to which SK (2000 IU/ml) was added. Addition of SK to the medium prevented a reduction of the viability of mature (14 days) dissociated neocortical cell culture from 1-2-day-old rats, induced by a transfer of the culture to a blood serum protein-deficient medium. In a 7-day culture SK potentiated the decrease in the cell viability. In organotypical cultures, with the use of electron microscopy, it was found that SK in concentration used prevented the development of destructive changes in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons of explants, induced by a deficit in serum proteins. The neurons contained numerous mitochondria, some of which had only a few cristae. Signs of destruction were observed only in neuronal nuclei. After exposure to SK for 48 hours an activation of oligodendrocytes (containing numerous myelin bodies) was noted which was accompanied by astrocyte disintegration (with hyperchromatic nuclei in the remaining cells).

3168,"High-frequency afferent stimulation induces long-term potentiation of field potentials in the ventral tegmental area Excitatory synapses on dopamine neurons in the VTA can undergo both long-term potentiation and depression. Additionally, drug-induced plasticity has been found at VTA synapses, and is proposed to play a role in reward-related learning and addiction by modifying dopamine cell firing. LTP at these synapses is difficult to generate experimentally in that it requires an undisturbed intracellular milieu and is often small in magnitude. Here, we demonstrate the induction of LTP as a property of evoked field potentials within the VTA. Excitatory field potentials were recorded extracellularly from VTA neurons in acute horizontal midbrain slices. Using extracellular and intracellular recording techniques, we found that evoked field potentials originate within the VTA itself and are largely composed of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSPs and action potentials triggered by activation of glutamatergic synapses on both dopamine and GABA neurons. High-frequency afferent stimulation (HFS) induced LTP of the field potential. The induction of this LTP was blocked by application of the NMDAR antagonist, d-APV, prior to HFS. As reported previously, glutamatergic synapses on GABA neurons did not express LTP while those on dopamine neurons did. We conclude that the potentiation of glutamatergic synapses on dopamine neurons is a major contributor to NMDA receptor-dependent LTP of the field potential. Field potential recordings may provide a convenient approach to explore the basic electrophysiological properties of VTA neurons and the development of addiction-related processes in this brain region.",Excluded

During cranial irradiation, exposure of healthy tissues is inevitable. Because of the presence of neural stem cells, a deep investigation on the effects of C-ion irradiation with respect to X-ray induced damage is mandatory to allow a better definition of treatments. In this work, the comparison of X-rays and C-ion irradiation-induced effects on human neural stem cell, focusing on multiple endpoints, such as cell viability, cytokine secretion and spheroid formation is presented. Results show different temporal and dose responses of human neural stem cells to the different radiation qualities, suggesting different underpinning mechanisms of radiation-induced damages.",Included
2460,"Spatial distribution of brain microhemorrhage resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) Introduction Microhemorrhages, commonly found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of TBI, appear as punctuate hypointense foci on susceptibility weighted images (SWI). To better understand the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages, we map their locations to a normalized space and apply region of interest (ROI) analysis using brain atlases. Methods MRI was performed in a series of 46 sequential patients enrolled in a natural history study of TBI. Susceptibility weighted (TR = 64ms, TE = 25ms, FA = 20degree, 0.49 x 0.49 x 2.0 mm) and 3D T1-MPRAGE (TR = 25ms, TE = 3.03ms, FA = 7degree, 1 x 1 x 1 mm) images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Biograph mMR in all patients. SWI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist on a Carestream PACS workstation, and microhemorrhages were labeled using the ""marker"" graphic tool. To characterize their spatial distribution in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, the T1-MPRAGE was affine registered to the MNI template. This transformation was applied to the co-registered SWI images and to the marker coordinates. The frequency of microhemorrhages in major brain structures was determined from ROIs using the digital Talairach brain atlas. Similarly, the frequency of microhemorrhage in labeled white matter (WM) tracts was performed by applying the Diffusion Oriented Tract Segmentation method to the image within MNI space. Results A total of 629 microhemorrhages were identified. An average of 13 +/- 34 (range = 1 +/- 179) microhemorrhages were present in the 24 positive patients out of all 46 cases. Microhemorrhages congregated around the periphery of the brain and were symmetrically distributed. Using Talairach ROI analysis, microhemorrhages were most prevalent in the frontal lobes 60% (377). The remaining lobar distribution was temporal: 10% (63), parietal 1.3% (8), occipital: 4.7% (30), limbic: 3.6% (23). Sublobar distribution was brainstem: 1.4% (9), cerebellum: 4.8% (31), deep cerebral WM: 6.8% (43), thalamus and basal ganglia: 1.3% (8). Microhemorrhages in WM tracts contributed 61% (384) in total. Restricting the analysis to WM tracts, microhemorrhages were primarily found in the corpus callosum 40.3% (253). Other WM tracts with notable proportions ( > 4%) include the anterior thalamic radiation: 4.3% (27), cortico-pontine tract: 4.4% (28), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus: 13.4% (84), inferior longitudinal fasciculus: 5.5% (35), middle cerebellar peduncle 9.1% (57), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus 8% (50), and uncinate fasciculus 4.4% (28). We note, however, that because white matter tracts are relatively small structures and the alignment was performed using only an affine transformation, these results should be considered as preliminary. Conclusions This study examines the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages in 24 TBI patients. Microhemorrhages were distributed mostly around the periphery of the brain, and were particularly common in the frontal lobes. Such a finding is likely due to many of these injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents, possibly with head-on collisions. In the WM tract analysis, the corpus callosum was implicated as a WM pathway that may be vulnerable to damage. Future work will expand the analysis to additional subjects, as well as examine distribution differences between impact and blast injuries. The relationship between microhemorrhage location and neurobehavioral symptoms requires further study.",Excluded

Six underwent postmission optical coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 4 had lumbar punctures (LP). Approximately 300 astronauts were queried regarding visual changes during space missions.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refractive change, fundus photograph examination, retina OCT, orbital MRI, LP opening pressures, and examination of visual acuity data.RESULTS: After 6 months of space flight, 7 astronauts had ophthalmic findings, consisting of disc edema in 5, globe flattening in 5, choroidal folds in 5, cotton wool spots (CWS) in 3, nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT in 6, and decreased near vision in 6 astronauts. Five of 7 with near vision complaints had a hyperopic shift >=+0.50 diopters (D) between pre/postmission spherical equivalent refraction in 1 or both eyes (range, +0.50 to +1.75 D). These 5 showed globe flattening on MRI. Lumbar punctures performed in the 4 with disc edema documented opening pressures of 22, 21, 28, and 28.5 cm H(2)O performed 60, 19, 12, and 57 days postmission, respectively. The 300 postflight questionnaires documented that approximately 29% and 60% of astronauts on short and long-duration missions, respectively, experienced a degradation in distant and near visual acuity. Some of these vision changes remain unresolved years after flight.CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the optic nerve and ocular changes we describe may result from cephalad fluid shifts brought about by prolonged microgravity exposure.

2849,"Computational modelling of the cerebral cortical microvasculature: effect of x-ray microbeams versus broad beam irradiation Microbeam Radiation Therapy is an innovative pre-clinical strategy which uses arrays of parallel, tens of micrometres wide kilo-voltage photon beams to treat tumours. These x-ray beams are typically generated on a synchrotron source. It was shown that these beam geometries allow exceptional normal tissue sparing from radiation damage while still being effective in tumour ablation. A final biological explanation for this enhanced therapeutic ratio has still not been found, some experimental data support an important role of the vasculature. In this work, the effect of microbeams on a normal microvascular network of the cerebral cortex was assessed in computer simulations and compared to the effect of homogeneous, seamless exposures at equal energy absorption. The anatomy of a cerebral microvascular network and the inflicted radiation damage were simulated to closely mimic experimental data using a novel probabilistic model of radiation damage to blood vessels. It was found that the spatial dose fractionation by microbeam arrays significantly decreased the vascular damage. The higher the peak-to-valley dose ratio, the more pronounced the sparing effect. Simulations of the radiation damage as a function of morphological parameters of the vascular network demonstrated that the distribution of blood vessel radii is a key parameter determining both the overall radiation damage of the vasculature and the dose-dependent differential effect of microbeam irradiation.",Excluded
2699,"Simulated Microgravity and Low-Dose/Low-Dose-Rate Radiation Induces Oxidative Damage in the Mouse Brain Microgravity and radiation are stressors unique to the spaceflight environment that can have an impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These stressors could potentially lead to significant health risks to astronauts, both acutely during the course of a mission or chronically, leading to long-term, post-mission decrements in quality of life. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to high concentrations of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids and low levels of antioxidant defenses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative damage in the brain cortex and hippocampus in a ground-based model for spaceflight, which includes prolonged unloading and low-dose radiation. Whole-body low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma radiation using (57)Co plates (0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) was delivered to 6 months old, mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-6/group) to simulate the radiation component. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Brains were isolated 7 days or 9 months after irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for characterization of oxidative stress markers and microvessel changes. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, was significantly elevated in the cortex and hippocampus after LDR + HLU compared to controls (P < 0.05). The combination group also had the highest level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression compared to controls (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the animals that received HLU only or combined LDR + HLU compared to control (P < 0.05). In addition, 9 months after LDR and HLU exposure, microvessel densities were the lowest in the combination group, compared to age-matched controls in the cortex (P < 0.05). Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers that may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress.",Included

However, the use of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials for patients with CNS tumors is in its infancy, so that long-term outcomes are difficult to predict and the ability to determine the effects of different agents and treatment approaches is scant.

2773,"Effects of Radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma: a retrospective analysis of a Single Institution BACKGROUND: Palliative irradiation of osteolytic lesions is a considerable component in the treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of irradiation in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with multiple myeloma who were admitted to our department between 1989 and 2013. According to the staging system of Durie & Salmon 116 patients were classified as stage III. 107/153 patients were treated with radiotherapy of at least one and up to 6 bony lesions at different times. In order to evaluate the effect of local radiotherapy on pain relief and bone recalcification a uni- and multivariate analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model to correct for multiple measurements. Complete information on dose, fractionation and volume of radiotherapy was available from 81 patients treated in 136 target volumes for pain relief, and from 69 patients treated in 108 target volumes for recalcification. Total radiation doses varied between 8 Gy to 50 Gy (median dose 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions, 5 times a week).RESULTS: Radiotherapy resulted in complete local pain relief in 31% and partial local pain relief in 54% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, higher total radiation doses (p = 0.023) and higher age (p = 0.014) at the time of radiotherapy were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of pain relief, whereas no significant association was detected for concurrent systemic treatment, type and stage of myeloma and location of bone lesions. The same variables were independent predictors for pain relief in the multivariate analysis. Recalcification was observed in 48% of irradiated bone lesions. In the uni- and multivariate analysis higher radiation doses were significantly associated (p = 0.048) with an increased likelihood of recalcification. Side effects of radiotherapy were generally mild.CONCLUSIONS: Higher total biological radiation doses were associated with better pain relief and recalcification in this retrospective evaluation of multiple myeloma patients.

2812,"Idiopathic occipital neuralgia a rare cause of debilitating headache LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Identify the presentation of occipital neuralgia LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Judicious use of diagnostic tools and treatment CASE: A 27-year-old female presented to the ER with episodes of severe intermittent headache over the past 3 weeks. Prior to her presentation at admission she reported 2 episodes of intermittent pain on the right occipital region. She promptly followed with her primary care physician who prescribed her oral steroids. The 2 weeks following the initial episodes were symptom free. On the day of admission she was watching television when she experienced a recurrence of the 10/10 right sided occipital headache with radiation over her vertex. Initial vital signs were unremarkable, however, physical exam was significant for tenderness over the right occipital region of the scalp. Labs were within normal limits. MRI did not reveal any abnormality. A consultation to neurology was obtained and the patient was started on carbamazepine, gabapentin and narcotics, which provided little relief. The patient's distribution of pain in the greater occipital area in addition to ruling out secondary causes of headache made ON the likely diagnosis. Pain management was consulted and greater occipital nerve block was performed which provided complete resolution of her symptoms. She was discharged home with carbamazepine the following morning and continued to be symptom free at follow up. DISCUSSION: Occipital neuralgia is usually defined as paroxysmal stabbing pain in the greater or lesser occipital nerve distribution. Although there is no published data to suggest the incidence of occipital neuralgia (ON), it is generally considered a very rare cause of headache. ON is a rare cause of headache that has no published data on incidence. Since this is a rare disorder there is limited evidence in the literature to support the full understanding of its physiology and treatment. Currently, the diagnosis ismade by history, characteristics described in the International Headache Society, exclusion of referred pain by CT/MRI and anesthetic block of the occipital nerve. Patients with severe symptoms can continue to have a debilitating headache despite conservative management. The best treatment in the acute setting is the same intervention for diagnosis, which is an occipital nerve block. Patients with recurrent ON symptoms despite steroid injections benefit from botulinium injections and pulsed radiofrequency. This case illustrates the detailed diagnostic evaluation and the need for high suspicion by the primary physicians to consider ON. It is often challenging to diagnose, yet it is critical to do so as early diagnosis and treatment can maximize recovery.",Excluded

2474,"""Cor Occidere"": A novel strategy of targeting the tumor core by radiosurgery in a radio- and chemo-resistant intracranial hemangiopericytoma Intracranial hemangiopericytomas (HPC) are chemotherapy- and radiotherapy (RT)-resistant. Here, we report on a novel stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) technique-""Cor Occidere"" (Latin), as a potential strategy of overcoming radioresistance of HPC. A 36-year old female presented to our clinic for consideration of a 3<sup>rd</sup>-course of RT for her recurrent cavernous sinus HPC, following previous cranial RT at 13 and 5 years prior, and a failed 9 months trial of bevacizumab/temozolomide. The tumor-adjacent brain stem and carotid artery risked substantial damage given the cumulative RT doses to these organs. We therefore designed an SRS plan targeting only the tumor core with 16 Gy single-fraction. Despite underdosing the tumor margin, we achieved stable disease over 25 months, contrasting her responses to systemic therapies. Achieving tumor control despite a suboptimal treatment that utilized high dose ablation of the tumor core suggests novel biological mechanisms to overcome radioresistance of HPC.

3565,"The effect of DFMO induced uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine on human glioma cells Polyamine synthesis inhibitors, such as alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, upon cessation of treatment, tumor growth resumes. We hypothesized that incorporation of radioactive polyamines might kill the growth-arrested cells. This hypothesis was previously tested in rat 9L brain tumor cells in which DFMO increased both the uptake and the retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine. In these rat cells, DFMO-induced retention of high-specific-activity [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine for 20 days resulted in several logs killing. In the present studies all of the 5 different human glioma cell lines tested with DFMO treatment also showed enhanced uptake of exogenous [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, reduced cell counts and enhanced killing of colony forming cells (CSF). Extending the time of DFMO treatment of cells that had taken up high-specific-activity (80 Ci/mmol) [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine further increased the killing. A 10-day extension resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in cumulative cell growth. A 5-day extension resulted in a 2-3 log decrease in numbers of surviving CFC. These data further support the hypothesis and suggest that DFMO-induced cell cycle arrest enhances cellular retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, increasing the effective internal radiation dose enough to cause proliferative death. In a clinical setting, the short (~ 1 mum) path-length of the tritium beta particle should limit effects to the tumor cells and spare adjacent normal cells. These results support the concept that treatment with the combination of polyamine inhibitors and radioactive polyamines might be a useful adjunct to current therapies for glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded
3008,"Re-Irradiation in Recurrent Gliomas: Treatment outcome and Prognostic factors Purpose or Objective: Gliomas have diverse prognoses that differ primarily depending on histologic subtype, grade and molecular marker expression. Even after aggressive multimodal treatment, most gliomas eventually recur. Treatment options for recurrent gliomas include surgery, chemotherapy, and re-irradiation. We sought to review our institutional experience with re-irradiation in the management of recurrent gliomas. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas who received re-irradiation between January 2012 and December 2016. Majority (20 patients) constituted High Grade Glioma. (Grade III and IV). Though the recurrence was more in Grade IV Glioma but these patients were not included in our analysis because of their poor performance status and Re-RT was not feasible in them. All the patients were assessed for Re-Surgery. Reirradiation was offered to recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and at least 6 months had passed after initial radiotherapy (RT). All the patients were treated after doing planning CT Scan (Non-Contrast) and MRI of Brain (3 D FSPGR sequence) with I.V contrast and images were fused for target delineation. Target volume was delineation was kept conservative and the mean volume was 80 cc (50 to 140 cc). Technique of Radiotherapy was IMRT/VMAT and fractionation used was conventional. 11 patients were treated with concurrent oral Tab TMZ and 1 patient was treated with Inj Bevacizumab, 2 weekly cycle. Result(s): Out of 31 patients, 11 patients were found to be fit for Re-Surgery but only 8 patients agreed to do so. All the patients received Re-Radiation. Median doses of reirradiation and initial RT were 45.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy, respectively. The median time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation was 18 months. The median PFS and OS after re-irradiation were 3 and 7 months respectively. 12-month OS rate was 40%. 3 patients developed radiation necrosis and needed prolonged steroid therapy. In univariate analysis, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) >=70 (p <0.001), re-irradiation dose >=45 Gy (p =0.040), and longer time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation (p =0.040) were associated with improved OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p =0.030) and length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation (p=0.048) were important predictors of OS. Use of TMZ did not show any benefit. Molecular markers were not available for most of the patients and hence correlation could not be done. Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation in conjunction with surgery could be a salvage treatment for very selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status. Re-irradiation was associated with only modest palliative and survival benefits in this retrospective review. Difficulties separating toxicity due to retreatment versus tumor progression and limited patient survival following retreatment preclude definite conclusions. Radiation necrosis was infrequent. Inspite of multimodality treatment, the treatment outcome remains dismal. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

In this study we evaluated the changes induced by maternal exposure to delta 9-THC (5 mg/kg per day) from gestational day 5 to postnatal day 24 in eight discrete brain areas on the central serotoninergic system in both adult male and female rats. These result show that maternal exposure to delta 9-THC from gestational day 5 to postnatal day 24 affects development of the various central indoleaminergic system of the offsprings brain. Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC decreased the levels of 5-HT in hypothalamus and rostral neostriatum in exposed males, and also decreased the levels of 5-HT in ventral hippocampus, septum, and midbrain raphe nuclei in both exposed males and females. Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC increased the levels of 5-HIAA in dorsal hippocampus, hypothalamus, septum, midbrain raphe nuclei, and rostral neostriatum in exposed males and females. We have also found differences between nonexposed males and females in several brain regions.

LTP induction was suppressed by footshock (FS) stimulation in 5-HT-lesioned rats and vehicle-treated controls. When rats were exposed to CFC, which was received 24 h after FS stimulation, LTP was also blocked in both-treated groups. CFC-induced impairment of LTP, however, significantly attenuated in 5-HT-lesioned rats when compared with that in controls. Fear-related freezing behavior after FS stimulation occurred similarly in both treated groups, whereas the behavior observed during exposure to CFC significantly reduced in 5-HT-lesioned rats. These results suggest that the serotonergic mechanism is involved in the psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be associated with fear-related behavior.",Excluded
2751,"In vivo protein secretion by lung. Evidence for active secretion and interspecies differences The present study is an attempt to determine (a) if the lung actively secretes protein into the surface-active fraction of lung lavage returns; (b) if there are interspecies differences in this secretory activity; and (c) if the amount of nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction shows interspecies variation. I found that pilocarpine stimulates the release of radioactive protein into the lavage surface-active fraction of rabbits and that this pilocarpine effect is completely blocked by atropine. Inhibition of lung oxygen consumption by iodoacetate is associaged with a dose-dependent inhibition of the pilocarpine-induced secretion. Microtubules may be involved in this secretory process because colchicine inhibits the pilocarpine effect. Of the radioactive protein in the total surface-active fraction (tissue plus lavage returns), a greater percent appears in the lavage surface-active fraction at 2 and 4 h, after a pulsed injection [U-14C] leucine, in the mouse than in the rat, which in turn has a greater amount than the rabbit. There is also a difference in the amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction of different species: mouse greater than rabbit greater than cat greater than dog. The amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction is directly proportional to the species respiratory rate; the log of the nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction is inversely proportional to the log of the species alveolar diameter. I conclude that the lung actively secretes protein into the lavage surface-active fraction, that this secretion is under neurohumoral regulation, and that respiratory rate and alveolar size may influence this secretory activity and the amount of protein in this surface-active fraction.",Excluded

3498,"Inhibition of Polo-like kinase 1 prevents the growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain Few therapeutic strategies exist for the treatment of metastatic tumor cells in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access. Thus the identification of molecular targets and accompanying BBB permeable drugs will significantly benefit brain metastasis patients. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an attractive molecular target because it is only expressed in dividing cells and its expression is upregulated in many tumors. Analysis of a publicly available database of human breast cancer metastases revealed Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in brain metastases compared to systemic metastases (P = 0.0018). The selective Plk1 inhibitor, GSK461364A, showed substantial uptake in normal rodent brain. Using a breast cancer brain metastatic xenograft model (231-BR), we tested the efficacy of GSK461364A to prevent brain metastatic colonization. When treatment was started 3 days post-injection, GSK461364A at 50 mg/kg inhibited the development of large brain metastases 62% (P = 0.0001) and prolonged survival by 17%. GSK461364A sensitized tumor cells to radiation induced cell death in vitro. Previously, it was reported that mutations in p53 might render tumor cells more sensitive to Plk1 inhibition; however, p53 mutations are uncommon in breast cancer. In a cohort of 41 primary breast tumors and matched brain metastases, p53 immunostaining was increased in 61% of metastases; 44% of which were associated with primary tumors with low p53. The data suggest that p53 overexpression occurs frequently in brain metastases and may facilitate sensitivity to Plk1 inhibition. These data indicate Plk1 may be a new druggable target for the prevention of breast cancer brain metastases.",Excluded
2471,"General anaesthesia for advanced cancer patients treated with combined surgery and intraoperative precision radiation therapy Intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IORT) is widely considered to have great potential for cancer treatment. The world's first mobile electron linear accelerator (Mobetron) has changed the way cancer patients are treated.1 This study is designed to test the anaesthetic management of patients receiving a combination of extensive surgery and intraoperative radiation using the Mobetron combined with remote monitoring. Safety and effectiveness of the Mobetron will also be assessed. Our initial study was to analyse the difference between patients who underwent surgery with and without IORT using the Mobetron. A further study was designed to assess neutron leakage measurements around the target tumour bed with a semi-conducting electrode. Twenty-four patients with locally advanced primary or locally recurrent cancer were recruited into this prospective study and were randomly assigned into the Mobetron group (n=12) and the control group (n=12). General anaesthesia was delivered during surgery. Narcotrend measurements for depth of anaesthesia and noxious stimulation were made. Radiation was delivered directly to the tumour bed or target section with the use of the Mobetron immediately after surgey (resection/laparotomy). The dose rate around the target tumour bed or target section was assessed with a semi-conducting electrode. During the 2 min of intraoperative radiation therapy, patients and monitors were observed via closed-circuit camera.2 No serious complications related to anaesthesia (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, and cerebral dysfunction) occurred. The level of anaesthesia, recovery time, intraoperative haemorrhage, blood transfusion, urinary output, crystalloid and colloid infusion, lowest temperature, SpO2 (%), E'CO<inf>2</inf>, were similar in two groups. The addition of radiotherapy extends the total time of anaesthesia by 20-30 min. The dose rate at the region around target is much lower than the target (0.11 Gy min<sup>-1</sup> vs 1.17 Gy min<sup>-1</sup>). The majority of patients were stable (haemodynamic and respiratory) enough to be discharged from the ICU to the ward within 3 days. Adequate preoperative assessment and preparation, reasonable anaesthesia management with the help of adequate remote monitoring, and effective multidisciplinary (Table Presented) communication all contribute to make IORT procedures feasible and safe. IORT has allowed a selective treatment approach to locally advanced primary and recurrent neoplasm which traditionally would have been deemed unresectable. Mobetron for IORT is a safe, reliable, and easy-to-master technique without any obvious side-effect. Stray radiation from the Mobetron is so low that no additional shielding in the operating theatre is required.",Excluded

Significant histological changes and BBB disruption were observed in brain regions heated to 43 degrees C and above. In the cortex heated to 41 degrees C, the CBF doubled 20 min after hyperthermia induction, and then returned gradually to the pre-hyperthermic level. In the cortex heated to 43 degrees C, the CBF increased to 134% of the baseline level 10 min after hyperthermia induction, and then fell gradually to reach its minimum level (31% of the baseline level). In the cortex heated to 45 degrees C, the CBF decreased immediately after hyperthermia induction to reach 10% of the baseline level. The results indicate that hyperthermia-induced cellular injury in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral ischaemia and the threshold temperature for such injury is 43 degrees C. This model is useful for investigating the effects of hyperthermia on various cerebral functions and the CBF changes demonstrated in the present study may provide key information for the analysis of other cerebral functions.",Excluded

The FDG avid sites were tabulated as the primary site, lower extremity, brain, and other sites. The hypothesis is that routine skull base to mid-thigh versus whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in patients with malignant melanoma will not change management.Results: Patients (26) were divided into those with primary melanoma site in either the lower extremities (six patients) or other site (20 patients). Four of the six patients with the primary site in the lower extremities also had positive findings in the ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes. One of the patients with a positive inguinal lymph node had metastatic sites in the external iliac region and lungs on the initial study. On follow-up imaging, this patient also exhibited diffuse metastatic disease, including a lower extremity. None of the remaining patients in this group had positive findings other than the primary site in the lower extremity. Of the remaining 20 patients with the primary site not in the lower extremity, one had diffuse metastatic disease that included a lower extremity. However, lower extremity involvement would not change patient management in this case. A second patient in this group had diffuse metastatic disease that also involved the brain. However, no metastatic disease was present in the lower extremities in this patient. None of the remaining 18 patients in this group had metastatic disease in a lower extremity. Two patients in the entire study group of 26 had brain metastasis on contrast-enhanced head CT, with one having multiple brain metastasis. PET failed to demonstrate some of the brain lesions. In the other patient with solitary brain metastasis detected on contrast-enhanced head CT, PET was negative.Conclusion: <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT imaging of the lower extremity may not be justified if the primary neoplasm is not located in the lower extremities. Elimination of lower extremity imaging will reduce scanning time and additional radiation exposure. Similarly, PET/CT imaging of the brain may not be justified if contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the head is already obtained since these are more sensitive.",Excluded
3080,"Focal brain lesions induced with ultraviolet irradiation Lesion and inactivation methods have played important roles in neuroscience studies. However, traditional techniques for creating a brain lesion are highly invasive, and control of lesion size and shape using these techniques is not easy. Here, we developed a novel method for creating a lesion on the cortical surface via 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation without breaking the dura mater. We demonstrated that 2.0 mWh UV irradiation, but not the same amount of non-UV light irradiation, induced an inverted bell-shaped lesion with neuronal loss and accumulation of glial cells. Moreover, the volume of the UV irradiation-induced lesion depended on the UV light exposure amount. We further succeeded in visualizing the lesioned site in a living animal using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Importantly, we also observed using an optical imaging technique that the spread of neural activation evoked by adjacent cortical stimulation disappeared only at the UV-irradiated site. In summary, UV irradiation can induce a focal brain lesion with a stable shape and size in a less invasive manner than traditional lesioning methods. This method is applicable to not only neuroscientific lesion experiments but also studies of the focal brain injury recovery process.",Excluded

This work compares geometric equivalence of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CTs and synCTs for brain cancer patients and quantifies performance for partial brain IGRT.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten brain cancer patients (12 lesions, 7 postsurgical) underwent MR-SIM and CT-SIM. SynCTs were generated by combining ultra-short echo time, T1, T2, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery datasets using voxel-based weighted summation. SynCT and CT DRRs were compared using patient-specific thresholding and assessed via overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index. Planar IGRT images for 22 fractions were evaluated to quantify differences between CT-generated DRRs and synCT-generated DRRs in 6 quadrants. Previously validated software was implemented to perform 2-dimensional (2D)-2D rigid registrations using normalized mutual information. Absolute (planar image/DRR registration) and relative (differences between synCT and CT DRR registrations) shifts were calculated for each axis and 3-dimensional vector difference. A total of 1490 rigid registrations were assessed.RESULTS: DRR agreements in anteroposterior and lateral views for overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index were >0.95. Normalized mutual information results were equivalent in 75% of quadrants. Rotational registration results were negligible (<0.07degree). Statistically significant differences between CT and synCT registrations were observed in 9/18 matched quadrants/axes (P < .05). The population average absolute shifts were 0.77 +/- 0.58 and 0.76 +/- 0.59 mm for CT and synCT, respectively, for all axes/quadrants. Three-dimensional vectors were <2 mm in 77.7 +/- 10.8% and 76.5 +/- 7.2% of CT and synCT registrations, respectively. SynCT DRRs were sensitive in postsurgical cases (vector displacements >2 mm in affected quadrants).CONCLUSIONS: DRR synCT geometry was robust. Although statistically significant differences were observed between CT and synCT registrations, results were not clinically significant.

For some patients, complete surgical resection is possible but may be associated with significant morbidity. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive alternative or adjunct to microsurgery for such tumors. We reviewed our clinical and imaging outcomes after patients underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for management of jugular foramen schwannomas.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with 35 tumors (one patient had bilateral tumors) underwent radiosurgery between May 1990 and December 2005. Twenty-two patients had previous microsurgical resection and all patients experienced various cranial neuropathies. A median of six isocenters were used. Median marginal and maximum doses were 14 and 28 Gy, respectively.RESULTS: None of the patients were lost to evaluation and the mean duration of follow-up was 83 months. Tumors regressed in 17 patients, remained stable in 16, and progressed in two. Five- and 10-year actuarial control rates were 97 and 94%, respectively. Preexisting cranial neuropathies improved in 20% and remained stable in 77% after radiosurgery. One patient worsened.

3046,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included

The PTV constraint was selected to ensure that at least 95% of the PTV received the prescription dose. The plans were evaluated based on D80 and D50 (dose to 80% and 50% of the OAR volume, respectively) and hotspot volumes within the PTVs. Gamma indices (GAMMA) were also used to compare planar dose distributions between the two modalities. The optimization and dose calculation times were compared between the two systems. The treatment delivery times were also evaluated.RESULTS: The results showed very good dosimetric agreement between the GPU and CPU calculated plans for any of the evaluated planning parameters indicating that both systems converge on nearly identical plans. All D80 and D50 parameters varied by less than 3% of the prescription dose with an average difference of 0.8%. A gamma analysis GAMMA(3%, 3 mm) < 1 of the GPU plan resulted in over 90% of calculated voxels satisfying GAMMA < 1 criterion as compared to baseline CPU plan. The average number of voxels meeting the GAMMA < 1 criterion for all the plans was 97%. In terms of dose optimization/calculation efficiency, there was a 20-fold reduction in planning time with the new GPU system. The average optimization/dose calculation time utilizing the traditional CPU/cluster based system was 579 vs 26.8 min for the GPU based system. There was no difference in the calculated treatment delivery time per fraction. Beam-on time varied based on field width and pitch and ranged between 15 and 28 min.CONCLUSIONS: The TomoTherapy GPU based dose engine is capable of calculating TMI treatment plans with plan quality nearly identical to plans calculated using the traditional CPU/cluster based system, while significantly reducing the time required for optimization and dose calculation.",Excluded

3411,"Patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells transfer mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes in tumor organoids Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer and its relapse after surgery, chemo and radiotherapy appears to be led by GBM stem cells (GSCs). Also, tumor networking and intercellular communication play a major role in driving GBM therapy-resistance. Tunneling Nanotubes (TNTs), thin membranous open-ended channels connecting distant cells, have been observed in several types of cancer, where they emerge to drive a more malignant phenotype. Here, we investigated whether GBM cells are capable to intercommunicate by TNTs. Two GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs) were obtained from the external and infiltrative zone of one GBM from one patient. We show, for the first time, that both GSLCs, grown in classical 2D culture and in 3D-tumor organoids, formed functional TNTs which allowed mitochondria transfer. In the organoid model, recapitulative of several tumor's features, we observed the formation of a network between cells constituted of both Tumor Microtubes (TMs), previously observed in vivo, and TNTs. In addition, the two GSLCs exhibited different responses to irradiation in terms of TNT induction and mitochondria transfer, although the correlation with the disease progression and therapy-resistance needs to be further addressed. Thus, TNT-based communication is active in different GSLCs derived from the external tumoral areas associated to GBM relapse, and we propose that they participate together with TMs in tumor networking.",Excluded
2461,"Overexpression of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant proteins renders glioma cells more sensitive to radiation Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or 2 (IDH2) are found in a subset of gliomas. Among the many phenotypic differences between mutant and wild-type IDH1/2 gliomas, the most salient is that IDH1/2 mutant glioma patients demonstrate markedly improved survival compared with IDH1/2 wild-type glioma patients. To address the mechanism underlying the superior clinical outcome of IDH1/2 mutant glioma patients, we investigated whether overexpression of the IDH1(R132H) protein could affect response to therapy in the context of an isogenic glioma cell background. Stable clonal U87MG and U373MG cell lines overexpressing IDH1(WT) and IDH1(R132H) were generated, as well as U87MG cell lines overexpressing IDH2(WT) and IDH2(R172K). In vitro experiments were conducted to characterize baseline growth and migration and response to radiation and temozolomide. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured under various conditions. U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells, U373MG-IDH1(R132H) cells, and U87MG-IDH2(R172K) cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to radiation but not to temozolomide. Radiosensitization of U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells was accompanied by increased apoptosis and accentuated ROS generation, and this effect was abrogated by the presence of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine. Interestingly, U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells also displayed decreased growth at higher cell density and in soft agar, as well as decreased migration. Overexpression of IDH1(R132H) and IDH2(R172K) mutant protein in glioblastoma cells resulted in increased radiation sensitivity and altered ROS metabolism and suppression of growth and migration in vitro. These findings provide insight into possible mechanisms contributing to the improved outcomes observed in patients with IDH1/2 mutant gliomas.",Excluded

Relevant stenosis was defined as diameter reduction > or =50%. During CTA, arrhythmias were present in 42 (30%) patients who were not excluded from the analysis.RESULTS: The assessment of stenosis or occlusion of bypass grafts resulted in a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 97%, and positive and negative predictive values of 93% and of 99%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy for the detection of graft occlusion or stenosis did not differ between arterial and venous grafts. The evaluability of bypass grafts was significantly lower in patients with arrhythmias or with heart rates > or =65 beats/min during scanning. However, in the assessment of evaluable bypass grafts, no significant differences were detected in the diagnostic accuracy in these subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective study demonstrates that 64-slice CTA is a reliable method for the assessment of bypass graft patency and stenoses even in an unselected ""real-world"" patient population.",Excluded

2919,"Benign central neurocytoma: A double misnomer? BACKGROUND. 'Central neurocytoma' is classically considered as an intraventricular benign tumor, largely based on data from small retrospective series. The authors present prospective data on 12 patients with tumors diagnosed as central neurocytoma, to highlight the diverse nature of this tumor and challenge the classic notion. METHODS. Between 1991 and 1997, 12 patients had tumors diagnosed prospectively as 'central neurocytoma'. Clinical, radiologic, and histologic data were collected, and Karnofsky performance score was evaluated for each patient. Proliferation marker studies were performed using Ki-67 labeling index. RESULTS. In two patients, the tumors were located in atypical locations, namely, the parietal lobe and the spine. Aggressive behavior characterized by clinical and radiologic evidence of tumor progression was noted in two additional patients. In both these cases, unusually high proliferation rates of 5.3% and 11.2% were noted. Total excision of the tumor, when possible, was the treatment of choice. Postoperative radiotherapy to the residual tumor may be of benefit in patients with clinically aggressive tumors, or those with high proliferation rates. CONCLUSIONS. Given the findings of this study; it is suggested that the traditional concept of central neurocytoma as a benign intraventricular tumor warrants reconsideration.

2743,"Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish Larval zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating the mechanisms involved in generating rhythmic patterns of behavior, such as swimming, due to the array of techniques available including genetics, optical imaging, and conventional electrophysiology. Because electrophysiological and imaging studies of rhythmic motor behaviors in paralyzed preparations depend on the ability to monitor the central motor pattern, we developed a fictive preparation in which the activity of axial motor neurons was monitored using extracellular recordings from peripheral nerves. We examined spontaneous and light induced fictive motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish (4-6 days post-fertilization) paralyzed with curare. All spontaneous and light-induced preparations produced alternation of motor activity from side-to-side (mean contralateral phase = 50.7 +/- 7.0%; mean burst frequency = 35.6 +/- 4.7 Hz) and a progression of activity from head-to-tail (mean ipsilateral rostrocaudal delay = 0.8 +/- 0.5 ms per segment), consistent with lateral undulation and forward propulsion during swimming, respectively. The basic properties of the motor pattern were similar in spontaneous and light-induced swimming. This fictive preparation can be used in combination with conventional electrophysiological and imaging methods to investigate normal circuit function as well as to elucidate functional deficits in mutant lines. Toward this end, we show that two accordion class mutants, accordion and bandoneon, have alternating activity on opposite sides of the body, contradicting the hypothesis that their deficit results from the absence of the reciprocal glycinergic inhibition that is typically found in the spinal cord of swimming vertebrates.",Excluded
3265,"Time resolved dosimetry of human brain exposed to low frequency pulsed magnetic fields An accurate dosimetry is a key issue to understanding brain stimulation and related interaction mechanisms with neuronal tissues at the basis of the increasing amount of literature revealing the effects on human brain induced by low-level, low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs). Most literature on brain dosimetry estimates the maximum E field value reached inside the tissue without considering its time pattern or tissue dispersivity. Nevertheless a time-resolved dosimetry, accounting for dispersive tissues behavior, becomes necessary considering that the threshold for an effect onset may vary depending on the pulse waveform and that tissues may filter the applied stimulatory fields altering the predicted stimulatory waveform's size and shape. In this paper a time-resolved dosimetry has been applied on a realistic brain model exposed to the signal presented in Capone et al (2009 J. Neural Transm. 116 257-65), accounting for the broadband dispersivity of brain tissues up to several kHz, to accurately reconstruct electric field and current density waveforms inside different brain tissues. The results obtained by exposing the Duke's brain model to this PMF signal show that the E peak in the brain is considerably underestimated if a simple monochromatic dosimetry is carried out at the pulse repetition frequency of 75 Hz.",Excluded
2940,"CT dose audit 2009-2014: Pre-and post Arpansa NDRL Introduction Since the inception of NDRL in Australia in 2011, CT dose optimisation continues to be a key focus in patient dose management. At Austin Health, we decided to perform a CT dose audit to review the CT dose trend and the effect NDRL has had at this practice. Method Retrospective data collection of CTDIvol and DLP values of procedures for 2 years prior to NDRL and 3 years post NDRL were taken. The following non-contrast procedures were audited, CT brain, CT chest, CT abdomen/pelvis and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis scans. Data was collected across 4 CT scanners and their median of the spread per year was taken as the facility reference level (FRL) as defined in the Arpansa National Diagnostic Reference Level Service Fact Sheet. The FRL was then compared with the NDRL values. Results Preliminary results indicate a dose reduction over time since 2009 for most procedures, which may be attributed to dose optimisation, CT technology and the establishment of NDRL as a benchmark for CT dose comparison. Conclusion Regular CT dose audits are useful in managing dose trends and dose optimisation. It can be seen that since the implementation of the NDRL in 2011, there has been a positive trend towards lowering radiation dose associated with CT at this facility.",Excluded

3588,"A novel specific application of pyruvate protects the mouse retina against white light damage: differential stabilization of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha PURPOSE: To mimic hypoxia preconditioning by a novel specific pyruvate treatment and to study its retinal protection against white light damage.METHODS: Six-to-eight-week-old BALB/c mice were exposed to strong white light calculated to produce photoreceptor degeneration. Some were given injections of pyruvate in a preordained protocol because evidence exists that proves pyruvate can affect the concentration of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of proteins and mRNAs in retinas. Morphology was analyzed with toluidine blue staining and was plotted using a spidergraph. A free nucleosome cell death assay was used to examine apoptosis. Retina explant cultures were used to investigate the background mechanism.RESULTS: Pyruvate administration stabilized hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. Expression of the downstream genes hemoxygenase-1 and erythropoietin mirrored the changes of the two HIFs, respectively. Importantly, pyruvate given not only before but also after exposure to light protected photoreceptors against apoptosis. In the retinal explant system, addition or depletion of pyruvate caused only changes of HIF-1alpha and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)-2, while HIF-2alpha and PHD1 were not affected. However, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-2alpha was stabilized by pyruvate but not HIF-1alpha.CONCLUSIONS: Pyruvate evoked a hypoxia-like response under normoxic conditions and was retina-protective against strong white light. This response included stabilization of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. This differential stabilization might be related to the distinct preference of their degrading enzyme of PHD2 and PHD1 in response to pyruvate treatment.",Excluded
2910,"Pilot pharmacokinetic and dosimetric studies of (18)F-FPPRGD2: a PET radiopharmaceutical agent for imaging alpha(v)beta(3) integrin levels PURPOSE: To assess the safety, biodistribution, and dosimetric properties of the positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical agent fluorine 18 ((18)F) FPPRGD2 (2-fluoropropionyl labeled PEGylated dimeric RGD peptide [PEG3-E{c(RGDyk)}2]), which is based on the dimeric arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide sequence and targets alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, in the first volunteers imaged with this tracer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Five healthy volunteers underwent whole-body combined PET-computed tomography 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after tracer injection (mean dose, 9.5 mCi +/- 3.4 [standard deviation] [351.5 MBq +/- 125.8]; mean specific radioactivity, 1200 mCi/mmol +/- 714 [44.4 GBq/mmol +/- 26.4]). During this time, standard vital signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) readings, and blood sample values (for chemistry, hematologic, and liver function tests) were checked at regular intervals and 1 and 7 days after the injection. These data were used to evaluate tracer biodistribution and dosimetric properties, time-activity curves, and the stability of laboratory values. Significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values were evaluated by using a combination of population-averaged generalized estimating equation regression and exact paired Wilcoxon tests.RESULTS: The administration of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was well tolerated, with no marked effects on vital signs, ECG readings, or laboratory values. The tracer showed the same pattern of biodistribution in all volunteers: primary clearance through the kidneys (0.360 rem/mCi +/- 0.185 [0.098 mSv/MBq +/- 0.050]) and bladder (0.862 rem/mCi +/- 0.436 [0.233 mSv/MBq +/- 0.118], voiding model) and uptake in the spleen (0.250 rem/mCi +/- 0.168 [0.068 mSv/MBq +/- 0.046]) and large intestine (0.529 rem/mCi +/- 0.236 [0.143 mSv/MBq +/- 0.064]). The mean effective dose of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was 0.1462 rem/mCi +/- 0.0669 (0.0396 mSv/MBq +/- 0.0181). With an injected dose of 10 mCi (370 MBq) and a 1-hour voiding interval, a patient would be exposed to an effective radiation dose of 1.5 rem (15 mSv). Above the diaphragm, there was minimal uptake in the brain ventricles, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. Time-activity curves showed rapid clearance from the vasculature, with a mean 26% +/- 17 of the tracer remaining in the circulation at 30 minutes and most of the activity occurring in the plasma relative to cells (mean whole blood-plasma ratio, 0.799 +/- 0.096).CONCLUSION: (18)F-FPPRGD2 has desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties. The primary application is likely to be PET evaluation of oncologic patients-especially those with brain, breast, or lung cancer. Specific indications may include tumor staging, identifying patients who would benefit from antiangiogenesis therapy, and separating treatment responders from nonresponders early.",Excluded

L-cysteine, a glutathione precursor, prevents oxidative damage. Transdermal patches (TDPs) loaded with L-cysteine hydrochloride (L-CyS-HCL) were fabricated by dispersion of L-CyS-HCL 5% w/w and different concentrations of sorbitol as a plasticizer in room-temperature vulcanizable synthetic silicone matrices (RTV-Si). The effect of sorbitol on patch physicochemical parameters was assessed; in-vitro L-CyS-HCL release profiles and ex-vivo permeation were studied. Pharmacokinetic parameters of endogenous synthetized in-vivo glutathione, after receiving IV bolus dose of L-CyS-HCl and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs were studied in rat model. The influence of L-CyS-HCL-RTV-Si-TDPs against damaging effects of mobile phone EMR on rats' blood and brain tissues was studied. The results revealed that patch plasticity, intensity reflections, surface porosity, L-CyS-HCL release rate and skin permeation increased with increasing sorbitol concentration. Pharmacokinetic profile for IV dose and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs revealed that the L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs provided a sustained glutathione plasma concentration-time profile over entire patch application. High significant differences in biological parameters (blood and brain samples) were observed for radiated rats using the patch in study compared with positive control rats.

2648,"Assessment of blood pressure control and target organ damage in a treated hypertensive population-Is clinic BP measurement enough? Introduction/Background & Aims: Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease and a major contributor to morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Hypertension is also a major CV risk factor in Saudi Arabia, with a prevalence of some 26% in the general population but higher in established CV disease, ranging between 45% and 75%. Despite a large repertoire of antihypertensive drugs available, blood pressure (BP) control rates are still suboptimal. Recent studies have shown that clinic BP alone may be a poor guide to hypertension control. Ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) is the gold standard for diagnosis of hypertension, assessment of BP control, and its various patterns may provide prognostic information beyond clinic BP. Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to compare BP control with clinic versus ABPM criteria. The secondary aim was to study the relationship between various ABPM patterns and subclinical target organ damage, ie, urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), and arterial stiffness as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and biomarkers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in a Saudi hypertensive population. Method/Summary of work: We studied consecutive patients aged 18-80 years old referred to the Hypertension Clinic at King Abdul Aziz Cardiac Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January 2016 and December 2018. ABPM was performed for a 24-hour period with an oscillometric device (Spacelabs), with readings every 30 minutes from 6 AM to 10 PM, and every 60 minutes from 10 PM to 6 AM. Patient diary was used to define sleep/wake periods. White coat effect was defined as office systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=90 mmHg with daytime ABPM SBP <135 mmHg and DBP <85 mmHg. Uncontrolled clinic BP was defined as systolic >140 mmHg and diastolic BP >90 mmHg. Masked uncontrolled hypertension (MUCH) was defined as controlled clinic BP with daytime BP >=135/85 mmHg (definition-1); 24-hour ambulatory BP >= 130/80 mmHg (definition- 2); and either daytime BP >= 135/85 mmHg or nighttime BP >=120/70 mmHg (definition-3). Dipping was defined as a 10-20% fall in nocturnal BP; non-dipping as <10%, reverse-dipping as <=0%, and extreme dipping as >20%. Arterial stiffness was measured as PWV using SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, Australia) and Mobilograph (IEM Medical). Hs-CRP, BNP, and ACR were measured using standard laboratory investigations. Results analysed using JMP Version 13, p < 0.05 considered significant. The study had Institutional Ethics Committee permission. Results/Discussion: The study population included 428 subjects (mean age 53.5 +/- 14 years, female = 45%). Nine percent of the population had WC; 45% had uncontrolled hypertension using clinic BP compared with ABPM criteria; 24 hr, 68%; daytime, 56%; and nighttime, 86% (p < 0.0001). Overall, 71% of the patients had MUCH which was driven by nocturnal hypertension vs. 24 hr or daytime (70% vs. 42% vs. 32%, p < 0.0001) respectively. Seventy-nine percent of the cohort had non-dipping of which 45% were reverse dippers; 6% extreme dippers and 18% dippers. Patients with ambulatory hypertension had significantly higher ACR (30.8 +/- 8 vs. 6.2 +/- 6, p < 0.01), PWV (11.2 vs. 8.9, p < 0.001), BNP (1.2 +/- 1 vs. 6.5 +/- 1, p < 0.05), and hs- CRP (1.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.4 +/- 2.3, p < 0.01) compared with those with raised clinic BP alone. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of masked suboptimal BP control in Saudi patients with treated and well-controlled clinic BP is high and is largely because of nocturnal hypertension. Ambulatory hypertension is also characterized by sub-clinical target organ damage, arterial stiffness, and vascular inflammation, not related with clinic BP. Therefore, ABPM should become a routine investigation to confirm BP control, especially in higher risk groups and/or those with borderline hypertension.",Excluded

[French] Purpose of the study: In order to investigate the role of radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of vestibular schwannomas, we have reviewed our own prospective cohort and the main series of the modern literature. Patients and Methods: Between July 14th 1992 and June 1st 2011, 2991 vestibular schwannomas were operated on the Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery Department of Timone University Hospital. All the patients have been evaluated prospectively, with a follow up longer than 3 years for 2336 patients, excluding patients suffering from type 2 neurofibromatosis (148 patients). In 7% of the patients, the vestibular schwannoma had previously been resected. According to Koos classification, in 17.6% of the patients, vestibular schwannomas were stage I, 51.8% stage II, 27% stage III and 3.6% stage IV. The mean tumour volume was 2.63 cm<sup>3</sup>. According to Garner Robertson classification, the hearing was still functional at the time of radiosurgery in 46% and subnormal in 20.9% of the patients. Result(s): Long term tumour control was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. A transient facial palsy was observed in 0.5% of the cases. The rate of trigeminal injury was 0.5%. Useful hearing was preserved at 3 years in 78%. This rate reached 95% in patients with no past history of sudden hearing loss. Other predictors of functional hearing preservation are the young age, the small size of the lesion and a dose to the modiulus of the cochlea lower than 4. Gy. We observed no radio-induced tumour. Only large, Koos IV vestibular schwannomas are contraindicated for upfront radiosurgery. In these patients, we propose a combined approach with a deliberately partial microsurgical removal, followed by a radiosurgery of the residue. Conclusion(s): This cohort is unique by the size of the population and the length of the follow up and results demonstrate the efficacy of radiosurgery and its safety, especially its high rate of hearing preservation. © 2012 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).",Excluded
3363,"Simulation of pulsed ELF magnetic fields generated by GSM mobile phone handsets for human electromagnetic bioeffects research Human provocation studies that investigate the effects of Global System for Mobiles (GSM) communication systems on the brain have focused on Radio Frequency (RF) exposure. We wish to further extend such study by investigating the effect of both RF and Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) field exposure, the latter generated by the GSM handset's battery switching. The use of a commercial handset as an exposure source for such investigations is problematic for a number of reasons and therefore a simulated exposure source, capable of producing both RE and ELF components of exposure, is desirable. As a first step in developing such a source, we have quantified and characterized the ELF field from several commercial handsets (the RF characteristics being already well understood). Through experimental measurement we deduce that these fields can be sufficiently simulated by a 9mm radius loop residing 10mm beneath the front surface of the handset device and carrying enough current to generate peak fields of 25 muT at the surface of the handset.

3628,"Medical Event Management for Future Deep Space Exploration Missions to Mars BACKGROUND: Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), such as voyages to Mars, will present unique medical challenges for astronaut crews, including communication delays and the inability to return to Earth early. Medical events threaten crewmember lives and increase the risk of mission failure. Managing a range of potential medical events will require excellent technical and nontechnical skills (NTSs). We sought to identify medical events with potential for rescue, range them according to the potential impact on crew health and mission success during LDEMs, and develop a list of NTSs to train for management of in-flight medical events.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subject matter experts with specializations in surgery, medicine, trauma, spaceflight operations, NTS training, simulation, human factors, and organizational psychology completed online surveys followed by a 2-d in-person workshop. They identified and rated medical events for survivability, mission impact, and impact of crewmember NTSs on outcomes in space.RESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest, smoke inhalation, toxic exposure, seizure, and penetrating eye injury emerged as events with the highest potential mission impact, greatest potential for survival, and that required excellent NTS for successful management. Key NTS identified to target in training included information exchange, supporting behavior, communication delivery, and team leadership/followership.CONCLUSIONS: With a planned Mars mission on the horizon, training countermeasures need to be developed in the next 3-5 y. These results may inform policy, selection, medical system design, and training scenarios for astronauts to manage in-flight medical events on LDEMs. Findings may extend to surgical and medical care in any rural and remote location.",Excluded
3202,"ATP consumption by mammalian rod photoreceptors in darkness and in light Why do vertebrates use rods and cones that hyperpolarize, when in insect eyes a single depolarizing photoreceptor can function at all light levels? We answer this question at least in part with a comprehensive assessment of ATP consumption for mammalian rods from voltages and currents and recently published physiological and biochemical data. In darkness, rods consume 10(8) ATP s(-1), about the same as Drosophila photoreceptors. Ion fluxes associated with phototransduction and synaptic transmission dominate; as in CNS, the contribution of enzymes of the second-messenger cascade is surprisingly small. Suppression of rod responses in daylight closes light-gated channels and reduces total energy consumption by >75%, but in Drosophila light opens channels and increases consumption 5-fold. Rods therefore provide an energy-efficient mechanism not present in rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Rods are metabolically less ""costly"" than cones, because cones do not saturate in bright light and use more ATP s(-1) for transducin activation and rhodopsin phosphorylation. This helps to explain why the vertebrate retina is duplex, and why some diurnal animals like primates have a small number of cones, concentrated in a region of high acuity.",Excluded
3607,"Ca2+/calmodulin-binding peptides block phototransduction in Limulus ventral photoreceptors: evidence for direct inhibition of phospholipase C Phototransduction in Limulus photoreceptors involves a G protein-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent steps involving InsP3-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+. While exploring the role of calmodulin in this cascade, we found that intracellular injection of Ca2+/calmodulin-binding peptides (CCBPs) strongly inhibited the light response. By chemically exciting the cascade at various stages, we found the primary target of this effect was not in late stages of the cascade but rather at the level of G protein and PLC. That PLCdelta1 contains a calmodulin-like structure raised the possibility that PLC might be directly affected by CCBPs. To test this possibility, in vitro experiments were conducted on purified PLC. The activity of this enzyme was strongly inhibited by CCBPs and also inhibited by calmodulin itself. Our results suggest that the calmodulin-like region of PLC has an important role in regulating this enzyme.",Excluded
2632,"Stimulation through electrodes implanted near the subthalamic nucleus activates projections to motor areas of cerebral cortex in patients with Parkinson's disease High-frequency electrical stimulation through electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reduce significantly the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the success of this treatment, the mechanisms of action of stimulation are poorly understood. To elucidate further the mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation and its effects on cortical activity, we recorded electroencephalographic potentials from 61 scalp-surface electrodes during low-frequency (5-10 Hz) bipolar stimulation in 11 patients with advanced PD (14 implanted electrodes were tested). In all electrodes tested, stimulation through at least one of the four contacts produced a medium-latency waveform with an average onset of 14 +/- 3 ms and peak at 23 +/- 4 ms. This potential typically increased in magnitude across contacts from ventral to dorsal. Within-subject comparisons of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated that the generator of the medium-latency potential was within the primary sensorimotor cortex or lateral premotor cortex ipsilateral to stimulation. The timing and topography of this potential were consistent with indirect activation of the cortex by excitation of pallido-thalamic axons that traverse the dorsal aspect of the STN. The potential evoked by stimulation through the contact used for optimal clinical effect was highly variable across electrodes and frequently different from the medium-latency potential described above, suggesting that the neuronal elements mediating the medium-latency potential were different from those that mediate the clinical effects.",Excluded

2609,"The effects of PDT in primary malignant brain tumours could be improved by intraoperative radiotherapy INTRODUCTION: GBM has a poor survival despite surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Cytoreduction and PDT have postulated to afford better local GBM-control. However, the interaction of PDT with newer novel therapies had not been fully investigated. This study reviewed the impact of PDT in conjunction with intraoperative radiotherapy.METHODS: Case note review of prospectively collected data of GBMs treated surgically by the senior author (SE). Patients received standard therapy (ST), ST+PDT or ST+PDT+IORT. ST involved maximum safe resection, PDT involved intracavity 100 J/cm2 630 nm laser and IORT involved intracavity 10-15 Gys using the PRS400 R. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically till death.RESULTS: There were 73 patients included in this analysis (42 males). The average age was 59years. Thirty received PDT and 43 did not. The mean survival of PDT-patients was significantly longer than those had ST alone (62.9 weeks vs. 20.6 weeks) (p=0.001). Patients < 65 year of age survived longer than those >= 65 year (p=0.033). IORT on its own did not make a significant difference to survival (p=0.111). However the average survival for patients who received PDT+IORT was substantially higher than those who received PDT alone (79 weeks vs. 39.7 weeks). Using a Cox regression covariant analysis, demonstrated that PDT was the only therapy to make a statistically significant difference to survival (p=0.018).CONCLUSIONS: PDT in high grade glioma was statistically significant therapeutic modality and its effects were further improved by IORT.",Excluded

3195,"UV-visible antagonism in extraocular photosensitive neurons of the anthomedusa, Spirocodon saltatrix (Tilesius) Attempts were made to identify extraocular photosensitive cells in the subtentacular region (the area between the ocelli and the nerve ring) and around the inner-nerve ring of the anthomedusan Spirocodon saltatrix. Irradiation with ultraviolet light (UV) led to inhibition of spontaneous impulses and after UV-off, an afterinhibition which lasted for a few minutes. This afterinhibition was rapidly overcome by exposure to visible light (VIS). UV-VIS antagonism of this type was identified in six different impulse systems monitored in extracellular recordings. Intracellular recordings from two of the six cell types showed that UV irradiation causes hyperpolarization which inhibits spontaneous activity. The other cell types showed no membrane potential changes during UV irradiation even though the cells' spontaneous outputs were inhibited. It was concluded that the photosensitivity lies in three kinds of nerves which are distributed widely through the subtentacular region and the nerve ring.",Excluded

Apomorphine is found to have no significant influence on the dopamine level in brain and striatum of non-irradiated rats, while L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine raise this level. On the 72nd hour after irradiation with 900 R there is no essential change in the dopamine level in brain and the striatum; apomorphine raises the dopamine level in brain and striatum; the effect of L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine is potentiated with respect to the increase of the dopamine level in brain and striatum.",Included
2425,"Treatment beyond disease progression: ALK inhibitors in ALKrearranged advanced NSCLC Background: Treatment of patients with ALK-EML4 gene rearrangement with ALK inhibitors (ALK-I) yields high response rate (RR) and prolonged progression free survival (PFS). Defining progressive disease (PD) using RECIST has been challenging in the era of targeted and immunotherapy, as some patients are perceived to be deriving ongoing benefit despite PD by RECIST. We explore the impact of treatment beyond progression with ALK-I on patient symptoms and treatment duration. Method(s): Patients with advanced ALK-rearranged lung cancer treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between 2009 and 2017 were identified. Treatment duration was obtained from medical records, assessment of PFS by RECIST 1.1 from patient imaging, and patient self-reported symptoms and performance status (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), ECOG PS) were collected prospectively. Result(s): 66 patients were identified with advanced ALK-rearranged lung cancer. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years, 49% were male, 78%presented with stage 4 disease, 47 received ALK-I therapy (median 2 lines, range 1-4). Over half (26/47, 55%) continued ALK-I treatment beyond RECIST PD. PD occurred most commonly in brain (15/47), lung and/or pleura (11/47); 17/47 received local therapy (predominantly radiation) and continued ALK-I. Data on time to RECIST PD and treatment failure are shown below. Only 34/47 patients had symptomdata available at baseline, 22 with severe symptoms; 70% improved with initial ALK-I treatment. At the time of RECIST PD, most of those continuing ALK-I beyond progression had not experienced deterioration of symptoms. Conclusion(s): Treatment beyond disease progression for patients with advanced lung cancer harboring ALK rearrangement is common and is often associated with maintenance of symptom burden.",Excluded
2841,"Diencephalic locomotor region in the lamprey--afferents and efferent control In vertebrates, locomotion can be initiated by stimulation of the diencephalic locomotor region (DLR). Little is known of the different forebrain regions that provide input to the neurons in DLR. In the lamprey, it had been shown previously that DLR provides monosynaptic input to reticulospinal neurons, which in turn elicit rhythmic ventral root activity at the spinal level. To show that actual locomotor movements are produced from DLR, we use a semi-intact preparation in which the brain stem is exposed and the head fixed, while the body is left to generate actual swimming movements. DLR stimulation induced symmetric locomotor movements with an undulatory wave transmitted along the body. To explore if DLR is under tonic GABAergic input under resting conditions, as in mammals, GABAergic antagonists and agonists were locally administered into DLR. Injections of GABA agonists inhibited locomotion, whereas GABA antagonists facilitated the induction of locomotion. These findings suggest that GABAergic projections provide tonic inhibition that once turned off can release locomotion. Double-labeling experiments were carried out to identify GABAergic projections to the DLR. Populations of GABAergic projection neurons to DLR originated in the caudoventral portion of the medial pallium, the lateral and dorsal pallium, and the striatal area. These different GABAergic projection neurons, which also project to other brain stem motor centers, may represent the basal ganglia output to DLR. Moreover, electrical stimulation of striatum induced long-lasting plateau potentials in reticulospinal cells and associated locomotor episodes dependent on DLR being intact, suggesting that striatum may act via the basal ganglia output identified here.",Excluded

3574,"Impact of cellular localization of survivin on the resistance of glioblastoma cells againstthe monoalkylating anticancer drugs Question: Despite constant progress in medical care, brain tumors WHO grade IV (Glioblastoma multiforme) remain incurable. In the last decade, survivin, an inhibitor of the apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, was shown to be a promising target, as it is selectively expressed in tumors and its expression correlates with the grade of malignancy and therapy response. Besides being an anti-apoptotic factor, survivin plays a role during chromosome segregation in mitosis. It passively penetrates into the nucleus but is actively exported out of the nucleus through its C-terminal nuclear export sequence (NES). Since nuclear accumulation of survivin was observed upon exposure to ionizing radiation, where survivin seems to support DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, the question arises whether also alkylation-induced DSBs impact survivin localization and how this affects DNA repair, cell cycle, clastogenicity and cellular survival. Method(s): DNA cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, transfection and generation of stable clones, immunofluorescence, colony-forming assays, flow cytometric cell death assays, western blot analysis, Co-IP/ interactome analysis, chromosomal aberration assays. Result(s): To answer the questions, we generated glioblastoma cell clones stably expressing either a GFP-survivin or a NES-mutated GFP-survivin fusion protein (GFPNESmut-survivin). In colony-forming assays, we observed that cell clones with strong GFP-survivin expression were mostly protected against temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line monoalkylating drug, whereas clones expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin were most sensitive. We also observed that GFP-survivin was efficiently exported out of the nucleus, whereas the mutated GFP-survivin retained in the nucleus and even accumulated during the time course of TMZ exposure. Neither of GFP-survivin variants co-localized with yH2AXfoci, but interestingly, cells expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin showed significantly more TMZ-induced yH2AX foci as compared to GFP-survivin expressing cells. This correlates with the observed overall survival after exposure to the drug. Coimmunoprecipitation in nuclear extracts of TMZ-exposed cells using survivin as bait revealed its potential specific interactors. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that only survivin localized in the nucleus renders glioblastoma cells hypersensitive to TMZ, which stresses nuclear survivin to be a beneficial prognostic marker and supports the use of nuclear export inhibitors as adjuvant drugs.",Excluded

3279,"Changes of visual field and visual evoked potential in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after radiotherapy. [Chinese] BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy is the main treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The incidence of radiation-induced complications, especially radiation optic neuropathy (RON), increases along with prolonging survival time of the patients. This study was to investigate RON in NPC patients after irradiation by visual field and visual evoked potential (VEP) tests. METHOD(S): A total of 28 NPC patients, who underwent conventional external-beam irradiation, received visual field and VEP tests before irradiation, at the end of irradiation, and 5 years after irradiation. RESULT(S): Thirty-four (60.7%) eyes in 21 patients developed pathological visual field; 15 (44.1%) of these 34 eyes occurred within 10-24 months after irradiation. Of the 34 eyes, 8 showed concentric visual field constriction; 6 showed bitemporal hemianopia; 8 showed local photosensitivity descend; 10 showed central or cecocentral scotoma; 2 showed scotoma enlargement. Forty-four (78.6%) eyes in 26 patients appeared VEP abnormity; 24 (54.5%) of these 44 eyes occurred within 14 months after irradiation. In small, medium, and large elements, VEP latencies were significantly longer within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P=0.001); VEP amplitudes were lower within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation without significant difference (P=0.249, P=0.940, and P=0.450). One year after treatment, VEP latency delay maintained in each element (P=0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.001); VEP amplitudes were decreased (P=0.002, P=0.189, P < 0.001). The incidence of pathologic visual field was significantly lower in patients received irradiation of < or =70 Gy than in patients received irradiation of > 70 Gy (50.0% vs. 77.3%, P=0.041). CONCLUSION(S): RON correlates to total irradiation dose. Pathologic visual field may indicate the position of RON.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to explore prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enhanced MRI after whole brain radiotherapy.METHODS: TA retrospective review of clinical data from 241 NSCLC patients with brain metastases received whole brain radiotherapy from April 2007 to October 2008 was performed. A number of potential factors that might affect prognosis after irradiation were evaluated. The significance of prognostic variables in the survival resulted from univariate analysis by Kaplan-Meier combining with Log-rank test, and the multivariate analysis was obtained by Cox regression model.RESULTS: Median follow-up time for the survivors was 19.1 months. For all patients, the median survival time (MST) was 8.7 months. By univariate analysis, female patients with KPS>70, no symptom when diagnosed with brain metastases, tumor controlled in the chest, and received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and combined target therapy were the important factors for overall survival. By multivariate analysis, female, tumors controlled in the chest, and combined target therapy were independent prognostic factors for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Tumor controlled in the chest was the most important independent prognostic factor.CONCLUSIONS: Gender, local tumor controlled, and combined target therapy significantly influenced NSCLC brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enchanced MRI survival after whole brain radiotherapy.eciated patient subsets and is a useful method for dissecting complex clinical situations.

2953,"Regulation of prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> synthesis after brain irradiation Purpose: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Included

This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences.METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system.RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded

To date, no mechanism to explain these findings has been identified. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure. The dose-response and time-course data from the multiple animal groups tested in this study provide no evidence of magnetic-field-induced DNA damage.",Excluded

2955,"Biophysical analyses of synthetic amyloid-beta(1-42) aggregates before and after covalent cross-linking. Implications for deducing the structure of endogenous amyloid-beta oligomers A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of large numbers of senile plaques in the brain. These deposits are rich in fibrils that are composed of 40- and 42-residue amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Several lines of evidence indicate that soluble Abeta aggregates as well as fibrils are important in the etiology of AD. Low levels of endogenous soluble Abeta aggregates make them difficult to characterize, but several species in extracts of AD brains have been detected by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and immunoblotting. Individual Abeta oligomers ranging in size from dimers through dodecamers of 4 kDa monomeric Abeta have been resolved in other laboratories as discrete species by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In an effort to reconstitute soluble Abeta aggregates in vitro that resemble the endogenous soluble Abeta aggregates, we previously found that monomeric Abeta(1-42) rapidly forms soluble oligomers in the presence of dilute SDS micelles. Here we extend this work in two directions. First, we contrast the size and secondary structure of these oligomers with those of synthetic Abeta(1-42) fibrils. SEC and multiangle light scattering were used to obtain a molecular mass of 150 kDa for the isolated oligomers. The oligomers partially dissociated to monomers through nonamers when incubated with SDS, but in contrast to endogenous oligomers, we saw no evidence of these discrete species prior to SDS treatment. One hypothesis to explain this difference is that endogenous oligomers are stabilized by covalent cross-linking induced by unknown cellular agents. To explore this hypothesis, optimal mass spectrometry (MS) analysis procedures need to be developed for Abeta cross-linked in vitro. In our second series of studies, we began this process by treating monomeric and aggregated Abeta(1-42) with three cross-linking agents: transglutaminase, glutaraldehyde, and Cu(II) with peroxide. We compared the efficiency of covalent cross-linking with these agents, the effect of cross-linking on peptide secondary structure, the stability of the cross-linked structures to thermal unfolding, and the sites of peptide cross-linking obtained from proteolysis and MS.",Excluded

Despite this concern, during the last few years, the use of radiosurgery for such lesions has increased steadily. OBJECTIVE(S): To define both the tumor control rate and the risk of RION over a long-term follow-up period in a large cohort of patients treated with multisession radiosurgery. METHOD(S): The local control and visual outcome of 143 patients who underwent multisession radiosurgery (mRS) were evaluated. Neurological outcome was also analyzed. The data for the present study were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. RESULT(S): The mean follow-up was 44 months (range, 12-113 months). All patients underwent mRS. The median prescription dose was 25 Gy delivered in 3 to 5 fractions. The prescription isodose, which typically encompassed at least 95% of the tumor, ranged from 65% to 86% (median, 80%). The mean tumor volume was 11.0 cm 3 (range, 0.1-126.3 cm 3; median, 8 cm 3). The progression-free survival at 3, 5, and 8 years was 100%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. Compared with baseline, visual function improved in 36% of patients, whereas 7.4% experienced a worsening in visual function (5.1% excluding the patients with progressive disease).

3320,"Comparison of Whole Heart Computed Tomography Scanners for Image Quality Lower Radiation Dosing in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: The CONVERGE Registry RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Novel technology in coronary computed tomographic angiography allows assessment of coronary artery disease with high image quality (IQ). There are currently two wide detector ""whole heart"" coverage scanners available, which avoid misregistration artifacts. However, there are no data directly comparing IQ between the two scanners. The aim of the current study is to investigate if IQ is different between the most scanners of GE and Toshiba broad detector scanners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter international cohort study comparing 236 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography using whole-heart scanners; 126 patients on scanner S1 ( Aquilion ONE Vision, Toshiba), and 110 patients on scanner S2 (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). Hounsfield units were measured using regions of interest in the descending aorta at 6 points (cranial slice, level of the visualized first, second, third, and fourth spines, and the caudal slice). We also compared the coverage length (z-axis) of the full width field of view between a single rotation of the two scanners.RESULTS: Evaluating mean CT attenuation values Hounsfield units through the scan range, are progressively reduced across the descending aorta in the S1 group, resulting in the larger difference of contrast brightness between the cranial and caudal slices compared to the S2 group (absolute difference: S2 13.0 +/- 4.4 vs S1 141.9 +/- 16.4, p < 0.0001; Percent difference: 19.3 +/- 2.1 vs -3.4 +/- 1.2, <0.0001).

Median radiation exposure was significantly lower for the S2 scanner 1.50 +/- 0.75 mSv vs the S1 system 1.9 mSv (IQR 1.7-2.7 mSv) (p=0.01). Z-axis coverage was larger for the S2 scanner 152.5 mm (244 slices x 0.625 mm/slice) than 133 mm for S1 (266 slices x 0.5 mm/slice).CONCLUSION: Although both ""volume"" scanners cover the whole heart z-axis with one beat, scans using the S1 scanner have a larger variability in attenuation values throughout the scan range, resulting in 20% increase in nonuniformity from cranial to caudal slice. Additionally, SD variation across the field of view, a metric of noise, is larger when using the S1 scanner vs the S2 scanner. These results indicate that the GE Revolution CT has more uniform contrast enhancement and more coverage, lower radiation and lower image noise compared to the Toshiba Aquilion ONE Vision system.",Excluded
2676,"Space radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and memory impairment in mice: ameliorative potential of the melatonin metabolite, AFMK Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",Included
2629,"Fluid shift induced alterations of the optic nerve head and peripapillary choroid assessed using optical coherence tomography Purpose: More than 50% of International Space Station astronauts demonstrate visual acuity decrements or ocular structural changes during or after spaceflight. The leading hypothesis explaining spaceflight-induced vision impairment is that a cephalad fluid shift leads to altered tissue volume and pressure relationships in the eye and orbit. We hypothesize that reducing venous outflow from the dependent limbs with a venoconstrictive thigh cuff will temporarily reverse or attenuate ocular and cerebral volume changes observed during 15degree head-down tilt (HDT). Method(s): Twenty normal subjects (12M, 8F) were studied following a 10 min stabilization period, seated, supine, HDT, and HDT with commercially-available thigh cuffs (CUFF) inflated to 60 mm Hg. We quantified Bruch's membrane to lamina cribrosa (LC) depth in 13 subjects and peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPC) in 19 subjects from enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography images. Average PPC was quantified from 1.5 to 3 mm from the center of the ONH along radial B-scans at clock hours 12, 3, 6, and 9. The optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and internal jugular vein cross-sectional area (IJVA) were measured using ultrasound. Mixed-effects linear regression model with repeated measures was used to test for significant PPC, LC, IJVA, and ONSD changes. All data are presented as mean +/- standard error. Result(s): Compared to seated (377+/-28 mum) or with CUFF (363+/-28 mum), LC depth significantly (P<0.01) increased in the supine (395+/-28 mum) and HDT (384+/-28 mum) positions. PPC at clock hour 9 significantly (P<0.01) increased from seated (198+/-16 mum) to HDT (208+/-16 mum), however CUFF was not significantly different from HDT. In addition, PPC at clock hours 12 and 6 were significantly different between the seated and HDT conditions. IJVA and ONSD increased from the seated (IJVA: 0.15+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.533+/-0.012 cm) to HDT (IJVA: 1.03+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.581 +/-0.012 cm) posture (P<0.001) but were not affected by CUFF. Conclusion(s): Moving from the seated to HDT posture alters LC depth and PPC. These results suggest that HDT, a microgravity analog results in an acute cephalad fluid shift that significantly alters posterior optic nerve head structure. Application of bilateral thigh cuffs inflated to 60 mm Hg for 10 minutes was not sufficient to reverse all these changes to levels measured during the seated posture.",Excluded
2915,"Activation of ATM and phosphorylation of p53 by heat shock p53 protein is phosphorylated in response to various stresses. Here we examined phosphorylation of p53 protein in normal human diploid cells after heat shock at 43 degrees C for 2 h. We found that heat shock stimulates phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 but not at Ser20, while X-irradiation at 4 Gy and 10 J/m(2) of UV induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and less significantly at Ser20. Increased phosphorylation of Ser15 was also observed in heat shocked GM638, the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line. Although X-ray irradiation induced phosphorylation of Ser6, 9, 20, and 37 in GM638 cells, heat shock did not affect the phosphorylation level of these serines. We observed little or no phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in two primary ataxia telangiectasia fibroblast cells, that are defective in ATM. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that immunoprecipitated ATM from both heat-shocked and X-irradiated normal human diploid cells can phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 to a similar extent. These results indicate that heat shock induces phosphorylation of p53, especially at Ser15, and its phosphorylation is mediated by ATM kinase.",Excluded
3140,"Seizure control after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: A 25-year experience OBJECTIVE Seizures are the second-most common presenting symptom in patients with lobar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control. METHODS Patients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up. RESULTS Seizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief. Copyright © AANS 2019",Excluded

3633,"Merkel cell carcinoma: recent progress and current priorities on etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical management PURPOSE: To expedite improved understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare malignancy of cutaneous neuroendocrine cells that has a 28% 2-year mortality rate.METHODS: This article summarizes a workshop that discussed the state-of-the-art research and priorities for research on MCC and on a new human polyomavirus (ie, MCPyV) recently discovered in 80% of MCC tumors.RESULTS: Normal Merkel cells are widely distributed in the epidermis near the end of nerve axons and may function as mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors. Malignant MCC cells typically stain for cytokeratin 20 as well as for other epithelial and neuroendocrine markers. MCC subtypes, which are based on histology, on cell line growth properties, and on gene expression profiles, have been reported but have not been linked to prognosis. Clinical management has been empiric. MCPyV is clonally integrated at various sites in the human genome of MCC tumors, with truncating mutations in the viral, large T antigen gene that interrupt viral replication. MCPyV seroprevalence may be high, as with previously known human polyomaviruses. MCC risk is increased 11-fold with AIDS and with other cell-mediated immune deficiencies, B-cell neoplasms, and ultraviolet radiation exposure.CONCLUSION: Development and validation of a range quantitative polymerase chain reaction and serologic assays for detection of MCPyV, as well as an infectious clone of the virus, would clarify the fundamental biology, natural history, and epidemiology of the virus, of MCC, and of other diseases. Contingent on standardized histologic diagnosis and staging of MCC, consortia are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant radiation therapy, and salvage therapies; consortia are needed also for epidemiologic studies of MCC etiology.

3494,"Improved survival for elderly married glioblastoma patients : Better treatment delivery, less toxicity, and fewer disease complications OBJECTIVES: Marital status is a well-described prognostic factor in patients with gliomas but the observed survival difference is unexplained in the available population-based studies.METHODS: A series of 57 elderly glioblastoma patients (>=70 years) were analyzed retrospectively. Patients received radiotherapy or chemoradiation with temozolomide. The prognostic significance of marital status was assessed. Disease complications, toxicity, and treatment delivery were evaluated in detail.RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly higher in married than in unmarried patients (median, 7.9 vs. 4.0 months; p = 0.006). The prognostic significance of marital status was preserved in the multivariate analysis (HR, 0.41; p = 0.011). Married patients could receive significantly higher daily temozolomide doses (mean, 53.7 mg/m2 vs. 33.1 mg/m2; p = 0.020), were more likely to receive maintenance temozolomide (45.7 % vs. 11.8 %; p = 0.016), and had to be hospitalized less frequently during radiotherapy (55.0 % vs. 88.2 %; p = 0.016). Of the patients receiving temozolomide, married patients showed significantly lower rates of hematologic and liver toxicity. Most complications were infectious or neurologic in nature. Complications of any grade were more frequent in unmarried patients (58.8 % vs. 30.0 %; p = 0.041) with the incidence of grade 3-5 complications being particularly elevated (47.1 % vs. 15.0 %; p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: We found poorer treatment delivery as well as an unexpected severe increase in toxicity and disease complications in elderly unmarried glioblastoma patients. Marital status may be an important predictive factor for clinical decision-making and should be addressed in further studies.",Excluded
2827,"Deterministic multiplicative gain control with active dendrites Multiplicative gain control is a vital component of many theoretical analyses of neural computations, conferring the ability to scale neuronal firing rate in response to synaptic inputs. Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output.",Excluded
3425,"Lymphatic leakage (ll) after resection of neuroblastoma Background/Objectives: Lymphangiogenesis and lymphangiogenic vessel remodeling is known to play an important role in cancer progression. Little is known about the impact of lymphangionesis in neuroblastoma. From a surgical point of view, lymphatic fistula is a potential complication after neuroblastoma surgery. Aim of this study was the evaluation of frequency and impact of lymphatic leakage in a center for neuroblastoma surgery. Design/Methods: Between 2003 and 2014, 210 patients (pts) were resected for neuroblastoma in our department for neuroblastoma. Out of these, 200 patients were eligible for this study. Patient charts were reviewed for INSS stage, surgical radicality, duration of abdominal or thoracic drainage and maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h. Result(s): Out of 200 patients, 73 patients (37%) had a duration of drainage of 7 or more days. Maximum amount of drainage was 4 liters per day; longest duration of intraabdominal drainage was 91 days. In case of chylous fistula, all patients were treated with a conservative approach. Duration of drainage was significantly associated with surgical radicality (p=0.000). Furthermore, the duration of drainage was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h (p=0.000). Lymphatic fistula was significantly associated with INSS stage (p=0.000). Overall Survival (OS) demonstrated a better OS for patients without LL (87% alive) than pts with LL (72% alive). OS was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 hrs (p=0.009), but not with duration of drainage. Conclusion(s): LL is a frequent complication after neuroblastoma surgery and in some cases with substantial loss of fluids and proteins. It can be treated in nearly all cases conservatively. One major problem is the delay of further chemotherapy and radiation which however does not seem to have a great impact on the prognosis.",Excluded
2911,"Synthesis of copper octabromotetracarboranylphenylporphyrin for boron neutron capture therapy and its toxicity and biodistribution in tumour-bearing mice Copper tetracarboranyltetraphenylporphyrin (CuTCPH) is a minimally toxic carborane-containing porphyrin that has safely delivered high concentrations of boron for experimental boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Copper octabromotetracarboranylphenylporphyrin (CuTCPBr), synthesized by bromination of CuTCPH, is one of several new minimally toxic analogues of CuTCPH being studied in our laboratory, which could possess comparable or better tumour-targeting properties with enhanced tumour cytotoxicity. Its biodistribution, biokinetics and toxicity in mice with subcutaneous EMT-6 (mammary) or SCCVII (squamous cell) carcinomas were compared with those of CuTCPH. The administration of approximately 200 mg kg(-1) of either porphyrin in six intraperitoneal injections over 2 days had no apparent effect, but administration of approximately 400 mg kg(-1) slightly lowered body weights, elevated alanine and aspartate transaminase activities in blood plasma, and depressed blood platelet counts for several days. Enzymes and platelets returned to normal within 5 days after those injections and body weights returned to normal within 2 weeks. High average concentrations of boron from either porphyrin were achieved in the two tumour models from a total dose of approximately 200 mg kg(-1). The high tumour boron concentration decreased slowly while concentrations in blood decreased rapidly. Boron concentrations in brain and skin were consistently lower than in tumour by a factor of 10 or more.

2516,"Brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis predicts response in cancer patients with brain metastases Lymphocytopenia is one of the main toxicities of radiotherapy and its severity is related to the irradiation dose. The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number. Therefore, evidence of brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded
2634,"Solution X-ray scattering evidence for agonist- and antagonist-induced modulation of cleft closure in a glutamate receptor ligand-binding domain Agonist-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of glutamate receptor ion channels provide the driving force for molecular rearrangements that mediate channel opening and subsequent desensitization. The resulting regulated transmembrane ion fluxes form the basis for most excitatory neuronal signaling in the brain. Crystallographic analysis of the GluR2 LBD core has revealed a ligand-binding cleft located between two lobes. Channel antagonists stabilize an open cleft, whereas agonists stabilize a closed cleft. The crystal structure of the apo form is similar to the antagonist-bound, open state. To understand the conformational behavior of the LBD in the absence of crystal lattice constraints, and thus better to appreciate the thermodynamic constraints on ligand binding, we have undertaken a solution x-ray scattering study using two different constructs encoding either the core or an extended LBD. In agreement with the GluR2 crystal structures, the LBD is more compact in the presence of agonist than it is in the presence of antagonist. However, the time-averaged conformation of the ligand-free core in solution is intermediate between the open, antagonist-bound state and the closed, agonist-bound state, suggesting a conformational equilibrium. Addition of peptide moieties that connect the core domain to the other functional domains in each channel subunit appears to constrain the conformational equilibrium in favor of the open state.",Excluded

Experimental models suggest that these resistant cancer cells undergo dormancy transition that is best targeted with a stemness modulator in its activation window through a strategy that we call ADAPT: Activating (CSC) from Dormancy And Potentiate for Targeting. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that 5FU activates while celecoxib inhibits and depletes these putative colorectal CSC. We retrospectively administer three year ADAPT therapy in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients using capecitabine and celecoxib +/- radiation following maximal responses (complete (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)) to first-line combination chemotherapy. ADAPT therapy led to 30% CR and additional 10% surgical CR whose median survival reached 92.7 months in patients with unresectable MCRC. (Lin et al AACR 2010 LB-254).

2641,"Motexafin gadolinium: a novel redox active drug for cancer therapy Motexafin gadolinium (MGd, Xcytrin) is an aromatic macrocycle that has a strong affinity for electrons, i.e., it is easily reduced. In the presence of oxygen, MGd accepts electrons from various cellular reducing metabolites and forms superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling. The reaction with NADPH is dramatically accelerated by various oxido-reductases including thioredoxin reductase. In vitro studies with various cancer cell lines have shown an increase in ROS and intracellular free zinc in cells treated with MGd. MGd increases cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and various chemotherapy agents and may be directly cytotoxic to tumor cells under certain conditions. MGd selectively localizes in tumors, perhaps due to their metabolic perturbations. MGd treatment in murine models enhances tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy agents. In controlled, randomized clinical trials, combining MGd treatment with ionizing radiation improves time to neurologic progression in lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The molecular target for MGd appears to be thioredoxin reductase which, when inhibited, results in cellular redox stress, cytotoxicity and an increase in tumor responsiveness to a variety of treatments.

We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001).

2732,"Neurocognitive functioning in adults who underwent nonmyeloablative hla-matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) Background: Individuals with SCD are at risk for neurocognitive impairments. While potentially curative, SCTs come with their own risk of neurotoxicities, particularly from radiation and high-dose ablative chemotherapies. Newer, nonmyeloablative regimens may prevent some of these toxicities. This study examines the long-term cognitive impact of nonmyeloablative transplants in adults with SCD. Method(s): Seventeen adults (11 males; mean age = 32.2 years, SD=9.0, range 17-52) participated in neuropsychological evaluations before transplant and 12 months posttransplant, as part of a research protocol at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Donors were HLA-matched siblings; the conditioning regimen consisted of alemtuzumab and 300cGy total body irradiation, and they received sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Evaluations assessed global cognition, processing speed, memory, attention, and executive functions. Patients completed the PROMIS Physical Functioning questionnaire. Result(s): Global cognition was within normal limits. Mean Verbal and Performance IQ scores were average at baseline and follow-up, with no significant changes noted. Mean processing speed scores were average, and increased significantly from baseline (M=92.1, SD=10.1) to 12 months (M=99.2, SD=11.6, t=2.1, p=.013). Mean scores on memory, attention and executive tests were average and stable across time points. No group declines in mean cognitive scores were noted. Mean t-scores on the physical functioning questionnaire increased from 41.6 (SD=4.7) to 49.0 (SD=10.0; t=3.4, p=.01), indicating significant improvement from baseline to 12 months post-transplant. Hemoglobin levels increased significantly from pre-transplant (M=9.1, SD=0.9) to posttransplant (M=13.1, SD=2.2; t=8.9, p<=.0001). Conclusion(s): In this small sample, a comparison of neurocognitive scores from baseline to 12 months post-nonmyeloablative SCT does not indicate any deleterious effects from transplant. In fact, a significant improvement emerged in mental processing speed. Physical functioning also improved per patient questionnaires. As suggested by some prior research, the significant increase in hemoglobin levels may underlie improvements in processing speed.",Excluded
2818,"Sex-dependent differences in the activity and modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons Women have greater temporal summation of experimental pain stimuli and also have a higher propensity for developing chronic visceral pain conditions. Sex hormone-mediated regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in nociceptive pathways is a plausible mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in modulation of NMDAR activity in adult male and female rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons were collected from adult male or female rats and grown in short-term culture in steroid-free media. NMDAR currents were recorded on small to medium size neurons by whole cell patch clamp using rapid perfusion with saturating concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid and glycine in the absence of extracellular Mg(2+). We found that the average density of NMDAR currents was 2.8-fold larger in DRG neurons from female rats compared with male rats (P<0.0001). Addition of 100 nM E2 increased NMDAR currents 55+/-15% in female neurons, but only 19+/-7% in male neurons. Potentiation was maximal after 20-40 min and dose dependent with an apparent 50% excitatory concentration of 17-23 nM. This effect was mimicked by E2 conjugated to BSA and attenuated by pretreatment with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A (1 microM) or the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182,780 (1 microM), strongly suggesting activation of a cell surface ER acting through a non-genomic mechanism involving protein tyrosine kinases to increase NMDAR currents.

3117,"Whole brain radiation therapy plus focal boost may be a suitable strategy for brain metastases in SCLC patients: a multi-center study BACKGROUND: The treatment for brain metastases in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare different brain radiotherapy treatments on SCLC patients with brain metastases.METHODS: In this multi-center retrospective study, SCLC patients who had undergone whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases from January 2012 to December 2018 were retrospectively screened.RESULTS: A total of 263 eligible SCLC patients were included in this study, among whom, 73 were women and 190 were men. According to accepted brain radiotherapy, the remaining patients were divided into WBRT plus focal radiation boost (WBRT+boost), WBRT, and SRS groups. In pairwise comparisons of the overall survival (OS), WBRT+boost group led to longer survival than did WBRT both in all patients (17.9 vs 8.7 months; P < 0.001) and 140 matched patients (17.9 vs 11.7 months; P = 0.045). There were no significant differences in OS between WBRT+boost and SRS groups in all patients (17.9 vs 14.5 months; P = 0.432). Among 74 matched patients between WBRT+boost and SRS groups, however, patients who received WBRT+boost led to a longer survival than did SRS alone (21.8 vs 12.9 months; P = 0.040). In pairwise comparison of the intracranial progression-free survival time (iPFS), WBRT+boost group also showed survival advantages over WBRT (10.8 vs 6.5 months; P = 0.005) and SRS groups (10.8 vs 7.5 months; P = 0.032).CONCLUSION: Due to the SCLC-derived multiple brain metastases and better survival time, focal radiation boost combined with adjuvant WBRT may be a preferred strategy for SCLC patients with brain metastases.",Excluded
2520,"Preconditioning with bright light evokes a protective response against light damage in the rat retina Constant exposure to bright light induces photoreceptor degeneration and at the same time upregulates the expression of several neurotrophic factors in the retina. At issue is whether the induced neurotrophic factors protect photoreceptors. We used a preconditioning paradigm to show that animals preconditioned with bright light became resistant to subsequent light damage. The preconditioning consisted of a 12-48 hr preexposure, followed by a 48 hr ""rest phase"" of normal cyclic lighting. The greatest protection was achieved by a 12 hr preexposure. Preconditioning induces a prolonged increase in two endogenous neurotrophic factors: basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). It also stimulates the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Erks) in both photoreceptors and Muller cells. These findings indicate that exposure to bright light initiates two opposing processes: a fast degenerative process that kills photoreceptors and a relatively slower process that leads to the protection of photoreceptors. The extent of light damage, therefore, depends on the interaction of the two processes. These results also suggest a role of endogenous bFGF and CNTF in photoreceptor protection and the importance of Erk activation in photoreceptor survival.",Excluded
2608,"Preservation of cognitive function following whole brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases: Complications, treatments, and the emerging role of memantine Whole brain radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients suffering from stage IV malignancies that have metastasized to the brain. Although this therapy is often effective at reducing tumor size and burden, it is associated with a spectrum of toxicities that often result in irreversible cognitive decline. Various drug and non-drug therapies have been evaluated to treat this neurotoxicity after whole brain radiotherapy is administered; however, currently available options have shown little benefit or come with side effects themselves that may outweigh the benefits of their use. For this reason, current investigations are focusing on preventing cognitive decline, rather than attempting to attenuate symptoms after they occur. Memantine has consistently shown promise in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies as a neuroprotective agent that may improve cognitive outcomes in patients undergoing whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine use prior to and during whole brain radiotherapy has been shown to significantly delay time to cognitive failure and reduce the rate of decline in memory, cognitive function, and processing speed. Its use has also been linked to significant decreases in brain edema, brain infarct size, and brain vasculature changes following whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine offers a promising safety profile with high tolerability and limited side effects. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the target patient population, the neurotoxic effects of WBRT, current treatment options, and a summary of the available literature surrounding the use of memantine in this setting.",Excluded
2930,"Using the combined model of gamma test and neuro-fuzzy system for modeling and estimating lead bonds in reservoir sediments Heavy metals attract a great deal of attention nowadays due to their potential accumulation in living creatures and transference in the food chain. Sediments of water reservoirs are considered to be a source of accumulation of these metals that develop in response to human activities and soil erosion. This study collected 180 samples of the surface sediments of water reservoir 1 at Chahnimeh in Sistan. Efficiency of the ANFIS model was evaluated to estimate the five bonds following the measurement of parameters in the laboratory. The following results were obtained for the parameters: organic carbon (OC) %, 0.31; cation exchange capacity (CEC), 37.07 Cmol kg; total Pb, 25.19 mg/kg; clay %, 45.87; and silt %, 39.02. These parameters were used as input for the training model. In the output layer, lead bonds were chosen as modeling targets in the following way: Pb f1 (4.61); Pb f2 (0.54); Pb f3 (16.28); Pb f4 (3.42); and Pb f5 (0.38) mg/kg. The best input compound in this model was chosen using the gamma test. From a total of 180, 88 data were considered for the model training section. Eventually, the neural-fuzzy model (subtractive clustering), developed for the prediction of lead bonds in the studied region, was able to account for over 99% of lead bonds in the sediments; considering statistical criteria of root mean squares error or RMSE (0.0337-0.0813) and determination coefficient or R<sup>2</sup> (0.92-0.99), this model showed good performance with regard to prediction.",Excluded
3281,"Real versus simulated mobile phone exposures in experimental studies We examined whether exposures to mobile phone radiation in biological/clinical experiments should be performed with real-life Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) emitted by commercially available mobile phone handsets, instead of simulated EMFs emitted by generators or test phones. Real mobile phone emissions are constantly and unpredictably varying and thus are very different from simulated emissions which employ fixed parameters and no variability. This variability is an important parameter that makes real emissions more bioactive. Living organisms seem to have decreased defense against environmental stressors of high variability. While experimental studies employing simulated EMF-emissions present a strong inconsistency among their results with less than 50% of them reporting effects, studies employing real mobile phone exposures demonstrate an almost 100% consistency in showing adverse effects. This consistency is in agreement with studies showing association with brain tumors, symptoms of unwellness, and declines in animal populations. Average dosimetry in studies with real emissions can be reliable with increased number of field measurements, and variation in experimental outcomes due to exposure variability becomes less significant with increased number of experimental replications. We conclude that, in order for experimental findings to reflect reality, it is crucially important that exposures be performed by commercially available mobile phone handsets.

3610,"The diagnostic accuracy of chromatic pupillary light responses in diseases of the outer and inner retina PURPOSE: To compare the chromatic pupillary light responses (PLR) in healthy subjects with those from patients with diseases of the outer or inner retina under various stimulus conditions, and to ascertain the parameters required to optimally distinguish between disease and control groups.METHODS: Fifteen patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), 19 patients with optic nerve disease (ON), and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled in this prospective study. ON included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12 s, and for stimulus intensities of 4 lx and 28 lx.RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3 s and 7 s after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4 lx, 4 s yellow stimulus are significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4 s, 28 lx blue stimulus at 7 s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON vs RP patients with a high specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one another.

Acute H3R stimulation or blockade with selective agonists and antagonists suggests a role for H3R in anxiety and cognition. However, little is known about the long-term effects of H3R blockade on brain function. In the current study, mice lacking H3 receptors (H3R(-/-)) were used to investigate the role of H3R-mediated signalling in anxiety and cognition. H3R(-/-) mice showed enhanced spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze. In addition, H3R(-/-) mice showed reduced measures of anxiety in the elevated plus and zero mazes involving exploratory behaviour and avoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli, but enhanced acoustic startle responses involving unavoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli. These behavioural alterations were associated with higher arginine vasopressin levels in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. These findings support a role for H3Rs in mediating histamine effects on spatial learning and memory and measures of anxiety.",Excluded
2721,"CEP-1347 (KT7515), an inhibitor of JNK activation, rescues sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells from death evoked by three distinct insults The c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade appears to play a role in some cases of cell death, including neuronal apoptosis. CEP-1347 (KT7515), an indolocarbazole of the K252a family, blocks this stress signaling cascade and promotes survival. Here, we used CEP-1347 to probe whether neuronal death pathways activated by distinct insults also possess elements in common. Cultured rat sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were induced to die by withdrawal of nerve growth factor, exposure to ultraviolet irradiation, or subjection to oxidative stress. In each case, death was prevented by 100-200 nM CEP-1347. Moreover, in each of these death paradigms, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activity in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells was elevated by two- or threefold, and this increase was totally blocked by CEP-1347 at concentrations that promoted survival. In contrast, 200 nM CEP-1347 did not block death due to serum withdrawal from undifferentiated PC12 cells or to activation of Fas in Jurkat T cell cultures, even though in each case c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activation occurred and was inhibited by CEP-1347. These observations suggest that some but not all death pathways triggered by different insults can include a common mechanistic component, a likely candidate for which is activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade.",Excluded
2979,"Responses of perivascular macrophages to circulating lipopolysaccharides in the subfornical organ with special reference to endotoxin tolerance BACKGROUND: Circulating endotoxins including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) cause brain responses such as fever and decrease of food and water intake, while pre-injection of endotoxins attenuates these responses. This phenomenon is called endotoxin tolerance, but the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. The subfornical organ (SFO) rapidly produces proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in response to peripherally injected LPS, and repeated LPS injection attenuates IL-1beta production in the SFO, indicating that the SFO is involved in endotoxin tolerance. The purpose of this study is to investigate features of the IL-1beta source cells in the SFO of LPS-non-tolerant and LPS-tolerant mice.METHODS: We first established the endotoxin-tolerant mouse model by injecting LPS into adult male mice (C57BL/6J). Immunohistochemistry was performed to characterize IL-1beta-expressing cells, which were perivascular macrophages in the SFO. We depleted perivascular macrophages using clodronate liposomes to confirm the contribution of IL-1beta production. To assess the effect of LPS pre-injection on perivascular macrophages, we transferred bone marrow-derived cells obtained from male mice (C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-EGFP)) to male recipient mice (C57BL/6N). Finally, we examined the effect of a second LPS injection on IL-1beta expression in the SFO perivascular macrophages.RESULTS: We report that perivascular macrophages but not parenchymal microglia rapidly produced the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in response to LPS. We found that peripherally injected LPS localized in the SFO perivascular space. Depletion of macrophages by injection of clodronate liposomes attenuated LPS-induced IL-1beta expression in the SFO. When tolerance developed to LPS-induced sickness behavior in mice, the SFO perivascular macrophages ceased producing IL-1beta, although bone marrow-derived perivascular macrophages increased in number in the SFO and peripherally injected LPS reached the SFO perivascular space.CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicate that perivascular macrophages enable the SFO to produce IL-1beta in response to circulating LPS and that its hyporesponsiveness may be the cause of endotoxin tolerance.",Excluded
3334,"Gold Nanorod-assisted Optical Stimulation of Neuronal Cells Recent studies have demonstrated that nerves can be stimulated in a variety of ways by the transient heating associated with the absorption of infrared light by water in neuronal tissue. This technique holds great potential for replacing or complementing standard stimulation techniques, due to the potential for increased localization of the stimulus and minimization of mechanical contact with the tissue. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Moreover, thermal modelling suggests that cumulative heating effects might be potentially hazardous when multiple stimulus sites or high laser repetition rates are used. The protocol outlined below describes an enhanced approach to the infrared stimulation of neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism is based on the transient heating associated with the optical absorption of gold nanorods, which can cause triggering of neuronal cell differentiation and increased levels of intracellular calcium activity. These results demonstrate that nanoparticle absorbers can enhance and/or replace the process of infrared neural stimulation based on water absorption, with potential for future applications in neural prostheses and cell therapies.",Excluded
2894,"Target delineation and optimal radiosurgical dose for pituitary tumors Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivered as either single-fraction or multi-fraction SRS (2-5 fractions) is frequently employed in patients with residual or recurrent pituitary adenoma. The most common delivery systems used for SRS include the cobalt-60 system Gamma Knife, the CyberKnife (CK) robotic radiosurgery system, or a modified conventional radiotherapy machine (linear accelerator, LINAC). Tumor control and normalization of hormone hypersecretion have been reported in 75-100 % and 25-80 % of patients, respectively. Hypopituitarism is the most commonly reported late complication of radiation treatment, whereas other toxicities occur less frequently. We have provided an overview of the recent available literature on SRS in patients with a pituitary adenoma. Critical aspects of pituitary irradiation, including target delineation and doses to organs at risk, optimal radiation dose, as well as the long-term efficacy and toxicity of SRS for either nonfunctioning or secreting pituitary adenomas are discussed. Single-fraction SRS represents an effective treatment for patients with a pituitary adenoma; however, caution should be used for lesions > 2.5-3 cm in size and/or involving the anterior optic pathway.

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 21 patients who were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, using either VMAT, DCAT or 3DCRT, were included in this study. The volume categorisation was seven patients each in <1, 1-2 and 2-3 cc volume. The treatment was planned with 6 MV FF and FFF beams using three different techniques: VMAT/Rapid Arc (RA) (RA_FF and RA_FFF), dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCA_FF and DCA_FFF) and 3DCRT (Static_FF and Static_FFF). Plans were evaluated for target coverage (V100%), conformity index, homogeneity index, dose gradient for 50% dose fall-off, total MU and MU/dose ratio [intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) factor], normal brain receiving >12 Gy dose, dose to the organ at risk (OAR), beam ON time and dose received by 12 cc of the brain. Result(s): The average target coverage for all plans, all tumour volumes (TVs) and delivery techniques is 96.4 +/- 4.5 (range 95.7 +/- 6.1-97.5 +/- 2.9%). The conformity index averaged over all volume ranges <1, 2, 3 cc> varies between 0.55 +/- 0.08 and 0.68 +/- 0.04 with minimum and maximum being exhibited by DCA_FFF for 1 cc and Static_FFF/RA_FFF for 3 cc tumours, respectively. Mean IMRT factor averaged over all volume ranges for RA_FF, DCA_FF and Static_FF are 3.5 +/- 0.8, 2.0 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively; 50% dose fall-off gradient varies in the range of 0.33-0.42, 0.35-0.40 and 0.38-0.45 for 1, 2 and 3 cc tumours, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study establishes the equivalence between the FF and FFF beam models and different delivery techniques for stereotactic radiosurgery in small TVs in the range of <=1 to <=3 cc. Dose conformity, heterogeneity, dose fall-off characteristics and OAR doses show no or very little variation. FFF could offer only limited time advantage due to excess dose rate over an FF beam.

2695,"DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone which can suppress amyloid fibrillation of polyglutamine peptides at substoichiometric molar ratios Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches lead to protein aggregation and severe neurodegenerative diseases. A highly efficient suppressor of polyQ aggregation was identified, the DNAJB6, when molecular chaperones from the HSPH, HSPA, and DNAJ families were screened for huntingtin exon 1 aggregation in cells (Hageman et al. in Mol Cell 37(3):355-369, 2010). Furthermore, also aggregation of polyQ peptides expressed in cells was recently found to be efficiently suppressed by co-expression of DNAJB6 (Gillis et al. in J Biol Chem 288:17225-17237, 2013). These suppression effects can be due to an indirect effect of DNAJB6 on other cellular components or to a direct interaction between DNAJB6 and polyQ peptides that may depend on other cellular components. Here, we have purified the DNAJB6 protein to investigate the suppression mechanism. The purified DNAJB6 protein formed large heterogeneous oligomers, in contrast to the more canonical family member DNAJB1 which is dimeric. Purified DNAJB6 protein, at substoichiometric molar ratios, efficiently suppressed fibrillation of polyQ peptides with 45degreeQ in a thioflavin T fibrillation. No suppression was obtained with DNAJB1, but with the closest homologue to DNAJB6, DNAJB8. The suppression effect was independent of HSPA1 and ATP. These data, based on purified proteins and controlled fibrillation in vitro, strongly suggest that the fibrillation suppression is due to a direct protein-protein interaction between the polyQ peptides and DNAJB6 and that the DNAJB6 has unique fibrillation suppression properties lacking in DNAJB1. Together, the data obtained in cells and in vitro support the view that DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone that can interact with polyQ peptides that are incompletely degraded by and released from the proteasome.",Excluded
3496,"The homeobox transcription factor Even-skipped regulates acquisition of electrical properties in Drosophila neurons BACKGROUND: While developmental processes such as axon pathfinding and synapse formation have been characterized in detail, comparatively less is known of the intrinsic developmental mechanisms that regulate transcription of ion channel genes in embryonic neurons. Early decisions, including motoneuron axon targeting, are orchestrated by a cohort of transcription factors that act together in a combinatorial manner. These transcription factors include Even-skipped (Eve), islet and Lim3. The perdurance of these factors in late embryonic neurons is, however, indicative that they might also regulate additional aspects of neuron development, including the acquisition of electrical properties.RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that a combinatorial code transcription factor is also able to influence the acquisition of electrical properties in embryonic neurons we utilized the molecular genetics of Drosophila to manipulate the expression of Eve in identified motoneurons. We show that increasing expression of this transcription factor, in two Eve-positive motoneurons (aCC and RP2), is indeed sufficient to affect the electrical properties of these neurons in early first instar larvae. Specifically, we observed a decrease in both the fast K+ conductance (IKfast) and amplitude of quantal cholinergic synaptic input. We used charybdotoxin to pharmacologically separate the individual components of IKfast to show that increased Eve specifically down regulates the Slowpoke (a BK Ca2+-gated potassium channel), but not Shal, component of this current. Identification of target genes for Eve, using DNA adenine methyltransferase identification, revealed strong binding sites in slowpoke and nAcRalpha-96Aa (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit). Verification using real-time PCR shows that pan-neuronal expression of eve is sufficient to repress transcripts for both slo and nAcRalpha-96Aa.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Eve is sufficient to regulate both voltage- and ligand-gated currents in motoneurons, extending its known repertoire of action beyond its already characterized role in axon guidance. Our data are also consistent with a common developmental program that utilizes a defined set of transcription factors to determine both morphological and functional neuronal properties.",Excluded

The pool sizes, exchange rates, and relaxation times of these proton pools were investigated quantitatively by fitting, and the net signals of amide proton transfer and NOE were simulated based on the fitted parameters.RESULTS: The results showed that the four-pool model fitted the experimental data quite well, and the NOE effects in human brain at 7 T had a broad spectrum distribution. The NOE effects peaked at a B1 of ~ 1-1.4 muT and were significantly stronger in the white matter than in the gray matter, corresponding to a pool-size ratio ~ 2:1. As the amide proton transfer effect was relatively small compared with the NOE effects, magnetization transfer asymmetry analysis yielded an NOE-dominated contrast in the healthy human brain in this range of B1.CONCLUSION: These findings are important to identify the source of NOE effects and to quantify amide proton transfer effects in human brain at 7 T.",Excluded

Valuable evidence is available from the deaths of nuclear workers who were exposed to low doses of radiation in energy, weapons and ship building plants.

Patients received 30 Gy XRT given in 10 fractions to the whole brain. In phase I, patients were treated in groups of three at each topotecan dose level; dose escalation proceeded until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. The dose-limiting toxicity proved to be grade IV neutropenia at 0.6 mg/m2/d, resulting in an MTD of 0.5 mg/m2/d. One of nine patients showed a response to treatment, and that was partial (OR 11%). Three had stable disease (33%), and four experienced progressive disease (44%). Median progression-free survival was 60 d; median overall survival was 102 d. Intravenous topotecan at 0.5 mg/m2/d concomitant to XRT with 30 Gy in 3-Gy fractions is tolerable in patients with brain metastases. This regimen has the additional advantage of providing systemic treatment to patients with metastases in other locations while whole brain radiation is in progress. Although response and survival outcomes in this small study do not appear higher than expected from historical controls, these were not primary end points, and larger studies on this topic would be useful to elucidate the efficacy of this combination treatment regimen. © Copyright 2007 by Humana Press Inc.

2496,"Differential intensity-dependent effects of magnetic stimulation on the longest neurites and shorter dendrites in neuroscreen-1 cells OBJECTIVE: Magnetic stimulation (MS) is a potential treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. This study investigates whether MS-regulated neuronal activity can translate to specific changes in neuronal arborization and thus regulate synaptic activity and function.APPROACH: To test our hypotheses, we examined the effects of MS on neurite growth of neuroscreen-1 (NS-1) cells over the pulse frequencies of 1, 5 and 10 Hz at field intensities controlled via machine output (MO). Cells were treated with either 30% or 40% MO. Due to the nature of circular MS coils, the center region of the gridded coverslip (zone 1) received minimal (~5%) electromagnetic current density while the remaining area (zone 2) received maximal (~95%) current density. Plated NS-1 cells were exposed to MS twice per day for three days and then evaluated for length and number of neurites and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).MAIN RESULTS: We show that MS dramatically affects the growth of the longest neurites (axon-like) but does not significantly affect the growth of shorter neurites (dendrite-like). Also, MS-induced changes in the longest neurite growth were most evident in zone 1, but not in zone 2. MS effects were intensity-dependent and were most evident in bolstering longest neurite outgrowth, best seen in the 10 Hz MS group. Furthermore, we found that MS-increased BDNF expression and secretion was also frequency-dependent. Taken together, our results show that MS exerts distinct effects when different frequencies and intensities are applied to the neuritic compartments (longest neurite versus shorter dendrite(s)) of NS-1 cells.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings support the concept that MS increases BDNF expression and signaling, which sculpts longest neurite arborization and connectivity by which neuronal activity is regulated. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MS is crucial for efficiently incorporating its use into potential therapeutic strategies.",Excluded
2535,"Transient fear-induced alterations in evoked release of norepinephrine and GABA in amygdala slices Presentation of a tonal cue that previously had been associated with a fearful experience (footshock) produces alterations in arousal and sleep that occur after the fearful cue is no longer presented. To begin investigating neurochemical mechanisms that may underlie the effects of fearful cue presentation, we measured release of [(3)H]-norepinephrine ([(3)H]-NE]) and [(14)C]-gamma-amino-butyric acid ([(14)C]-GABA) from brain regions known to regulate arousal states and REM sleep. Depolarization-evoked release of [(3)H]-NE from amygdalar slices of mice, which were trained to recognize a tone as a fearful cue, was suppressed at 2-3 h after exposure of animals to the fearful cue, but recovered after 4-5 h. Interestingly, depolarization-evoked release of [(14)C]-GABA was significantly increased in the amygdala, and also showed a tendency for enhancement in the hippocampus, NPO, and DRN at 2-3 h after cue presentation. The changes in [(14)C]-GABA release were also transient; 4-5 h after cue presentation no significant differences were detected between samples derived from experimental groups which experienced fearful or neutral cues. The similar time course of fearful cue-induced changes in neurotransmitter release and changes in arousal and REM sleep suggests that alterations in amygdalar neurotransmission may be involved in the changes in arousal and sleep that occur after fear.",Excluded
2468,"Dynamic simulation of knowledge based reasoning of nuclear power plant operator in accident conditions: Modeling and simulation foundations This paper describes major additions to the modeling and simulation capabilities of the Accident Dynamic Simulator paired with the Information, Decision, and Action in a Crew context (ADS-IDAC), a platform for conducting dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (DPRA) of nuclear power plants. The new advancements are mostly in modeling of operator knowledge-based behavior in accident conditions, enhancing realism of the IDAC model, and simulation approach to Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). The focus is situation assessment and diagnosis of the accident cause. Knowledge-based reasoning plays an important role in this phase. A reasoning module has been developed and implemented in ADS-IDAC to simulate operators' knowledge-based reasoning. This paper describes the cognitive architecture of the reasoning module, including knowledge representation (model of operator's understanding of the plant systems and functions), a memory representation, information processing flow, reasoning sequence generation, and rules for accident diagnosis. Some theoretical and empirical insights for human error prediction are embedded in this causal model as simulation rules. Human cognitive limitations and heuristics that potentially contribute to human errors are explicitly modeled. Together with the model description, several example simulations are provided to demonstrate different features of the reasoning module. Examples of the simulation show that the reasoning module in ADS-IDAC produces realistic knowledge-based responses by capturing cognitive limitations, deliberative reasoning, and dynamic of accident progression.

2606,"Divergent effects of irradiation on brain cortical morphology in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: one-year follow-up study using structural magnetic resonance imaging Background: Increasing evidence indicates that radiotherapy (RT)-induced brain cortical deficits may play a critical role in developing radiation encephalopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the evolutional processes of RT-induced cortical injury have not been sufficiently investigated. This study investigates RT-induced effects on cortical morphology using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPC patients.Methods: Using MRI-based morphometry with surface-based measures, we evaluated the longitudinal alterations of cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 104 NPC patients at pre-RT (n=104), within 3 months post-RT (n=92), 6 months post-RT (n=71), and 9-12 months post-RT (n=52). Twenty healthy controls were also evaluated in parallel. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies.",Included
3278,"Stereotactic Gamma thalamotomy for the treatment of parkinsonism From September 1994 to June 1995, eight patients with intractable parkinsonism underwent gamma thalamotomy in our hospital. All of these patients were male, with an average age of 59.3 years. The duration of the disease from initial diagnosis was 2-10 years (mean 6.8 years). All had failed or had serious side effects with antiparkinsonian medicine. Seven cases had tremor-dominant symptoms, while the other had mainly rigidity. Six cases had bilateral symptoms. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken prior to treatment in all cases to exclude focal brain lesions. Stereotactic MRI was taken with the Leksell frame in place and both T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. The targets were located in the area of Vim/Voa/Vop based on the Schaltenbrand atlas. In seven cases, two plugged 4-mm-collimator shots were used. The maximum dose was 160 Gy in six cases and 180 Gy in one case. In another case, a single 4-mm-collimator shot was used, and a maximum dose of 160 Gy was delivered to the target center. The border of the internal capsule was outside the 20-30% isodose line. We intended the 50% isodose line to have an oval-shaped region with the use of two shots and should correspond to the shape of Vim. Follow-up data were available for six patients (mean: 4.5 months, range: 2-9 months). Tremor disappeared in three cases and improved in the other three. In one of these six cases, the tremor disappeared just 3 days after gamma thalamotomy. Rigidity improved in four of these six cases. In only one patient, treated with a maximum dose of 180 Gy, was there any contralateral limb weakness, which developed 3 months after treatment and has been recovering gradually. Follow-up MRI T2-weighted images in this case showed that the diameter of the lesion was larger than intended and there was a region of diffuse edema in the thalamus and upper brain stem. No other complications occurred in this series.",Excluded
2867,"Early neural grafts transiently reduce the behavioral effects of radiation-induced fascia dentata granule cell hypoplasia X-irradiation of the neonatal rat hippocampus produces a selective hypoplasia of fascia dentata granule cells, locomotor hyperactivity, perseverative movements and deficits in passive avoidance. We previously reported that transplantation of fetal hippocampal tissue into the adult (age = 182 +/- 4 days) brain produced a partial recovery of these behavioral deficits. Since graft/host interconnections are more prominent when transplants are conducted soon after radiation-induced hippocampal damage, in this study we transplanted hippocampal or cerebral cortex neurons when host rats were 33 +/- 5 days of age (i.e. only 16 days after radiogenic brain damage). Behavioral evaluations were conducted 80 and 182 days after transplantation or surgical control procedures. In the first test series only, selective components of locomotion (e.g. stereotypy and total distance traveled) and perseverative turning (e.g. mean bout length and turning speed topography) were normalized by the hippocampal grafts. Radiation-induced changes in passive avoidance were less prominent in these studies than in past experiments. Still, transplantation of hippocampal tissue improved performance on this learning task as well. Cerebral cortex grafts did not produce reliable improvements in most behavioral measures. These data suggest that hippocampal grafts placed soon after X-ray induced fascia dentata hypoplasia reduce a broad range of behavioral deficits. However, these benefits are transient and, for the most part, depend on the use of transplant tissues homologous with those damaged.",Excluded
3130,"The probability distribution of side-chain conformations in [Leu] and [Met]enkephalin determines the potency and selectivity to mu and delta opiate receptors The structure of enkephalin, a small neuropeptide with five amino acids, has been simulated on computers using molecular dynamics. Such simulations exhibit a few stable conformations, which also have been identified experimentally. The simulations provide the possibility to perform cluster analysis in the space defined by potentially pharmacophoric measures such as dihedral angles, side-chain orientation, etc. By analyzing the statistics of the resulting clusters, the probability distribution of the side-chain conformations may be determined. These probabilities allow us to predict the selectivity of [Leu]enkephalin and [Met]enkephalin to the known mu- and delta-type opiate receptors to which they bind as agonists. Other plausible consequences of these probability distributions are discussed in relation to the way in which they may influence the dynamics of the synapse.",Excluded
2565,"Role of 11C-Methionine PET/CT for radiotherapy Planning of patients affected by Primary Brain Tumour Purpose: 11C-MET is a radiolabelled aminoacid successfully utilized in PET imaging of primary and metastatic brain tumours. So far, very limited evidence concerns its utilization for radiotherapy planning. Thus the aim of our study is that to investigate its role in patients affected by rimary brain tumours in this clinical setting. Method(s): we enrolled 21 patients (M:F=14:8; mean age 53.2yrs) affected by a histologically proven primary/relapsed gliomas, who were addressed to our Institution for radiotherapy. Almost half of them (10/21) had already been treated and presented during relapse. In all cases dedicated MR, CT and MET-PET were scheduled before treatment and performed according to standard procedures. GTV was outlined on CT images fused to MR (GTV-MRI/CT), on MET-PET positive regions only (GTV-PET), and final volumes were calculated by using PET/CT/MRI coregistered images. Optimal radiation dose required was 60Gy. In 7 patients a contemporary Chemo/radiotherapy regimen was administered. The mean observational period was 6months, up to 22months. In 13 patients a postradiotherapy evaluation was performed and of these we calculated PFS and OS. In 3 patients progression/relapse was defined within 7 months, whereas other 3 patients deceased within 2 months. Statistical analysis was performed on clinical and instrumental data in order to define correlation and prognostic value of different parameters. Result(s): in19 out of 21 patients a GTV-PET could be defined (mean 18,3cc), which in 14 cases (73,7%) determined a modification of the GTVMRI/ CT (mean 58.79cc). Malignant lesions presented a SUV<inf>max</inf>=3.37 (range1.60- 5.17) and a SUVratio(SUV<inf>max</inf>/SUVnormal)=2.43 (range1.53-3.26). There was a significant correlation between tumour grade and SUV<inf>max</inf> (p<0,0001). In 10/21 cases the tumour was multifocal, of which 3/10 bilateral. The overall volume change, according MET-PET, was 139,58cc (mean 6,65cc), corresponding to 11,2% of total GTV. The ROC-analysis defined an optimal SUV<inf>max</inf> cut-off point<=2,7 (Sens.100%; Spec.90%), whereas for SUVratio<=1,73 (Sens.100%; Spec.81,3%). Univariate analysis on PFS documented a significant correlation for SUV<inf>max</inf> cut-off (p=0,0077) and SUVratio cut-off (p=0,0301), but not for tumour grade (p=0,7961), previous relapses (p=0,1573), tumour multifocality (p=0,5271) and concomitant chemo/radiotherapy (p=0,5749). Conclusion(s): our data demonstrate that MET-PET has a significant impact on radiotherapy planning of patients presenting with primary/relapsed gliomas. Moreover, metabolic characteristics of the tumours appear better correlated to patients outcome, compared to other clinical parameters.",Excluded
3516,Aortic arch injection with C-arm cone beam CT for radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Technical note Background: C-arm cone beam CT (CBCT) with selective intra-arterial contrast injection combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is currently used for the evaluation and treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In some instances an AVM will derive its blood supply from more than one main cervical artery (carotid and/or vertebral artery) and a single-vessel injection will not adequately demonstrate the entire AVM nidus. Method(s): Three patients with cerebral AVM in whom the entire nidus could not be visualized by injection of a single cervical artery are reported. CBCT dataset acquisition was performed by intra-arterial contrast injection in the ascending thoracic aorta through a 5 F pigtail catheter. The injection of diluted iodinated contrast agent (35%) lasted 22 s at a rate of 8 ml/s for a total volume of 176 ml (61.6 ml of contrast agent). The dataset was then processed using standard reconstruction methods. Result(s): Contrast injection in the ascending aorta during a single CBCT acquisition provided a volumetric dataset adequate for subsequent radiosurgical treatment planning. Conclusion(s): This is a safe and effective angiographic technique for the acquisition of volumetric datasets using CBCT that are suitable for treatment planning of intracranial AVMs deriving their blood supply from more than one major cervical artery. This technique allows imaging of the entire AVM nidus during a single CBCT acquisition.,Excluded

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the minor proteins was performed on a nano-HPLC Agilent 1100 system (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) in combination with a LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo, Germany). A total of 238 proteins was identified. According to the TIGER database, a tissue origin was established for 129 proteins. We identified 20 proteins related to the cardiovascular system.

2563,"Asynchronous inputs and NMDA conductances predict excitatory responses in the cortical-cA1 pathway of the hippocampus In the hippocampus, CA1 place cells are driven by a substantial input from CA3. There is a second pathway to CA1 from the entorhinal cortex. The mode of action of cortex on CA1 through this pathway is not known. The pathway supports CA1 place field activity after CA3 has been lesioned, yet stimulation of the pathway in rat slices results in strong feedforward inhibition that prevents pyramidal cell action potentials. We use a detailed conductance-based model of this pathway to simulate the response to cortical stimulation in slice experiments and in vivo spatial exploration. We find that the presence of NMDA conductances enable CA1 pyramidal cells to integrate cortical inputs over a time scale longer than that which is effective in recruiting the inhibitory response that can suppress action potentials. We then show that this asynchronous response mode supports place field formation in response to experimentally constrained spatially modulated cortical activity. Within this model, the inclusion of GABAB conductances and the hyperpolarisation activated current I(h) reduces the strength of the GABAA inputs required to balance the excitatory inputs, and this facilitates place field formation by reducing variability in the inhibitory inputs.",Excluded

Procedure details and time (including duration, radiation exposure, and fluoroscopy) and procedure-related complications were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 155 PED deployment procedures were performed under CS. Treatment was successfully completed in all cases. Anesthesia was converted from CS to general anesthesia during 5 procedures. Mean interval from patient entry at the endovascular suite to procedure initiation was 18 minutes (range, 5 minutes-1 hour 10 minutes). Mean procedure length was 1 hour 25 minutes (range, 30 minutes-3 hours 51 minutes). Mean +/- SD values for fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were 36.17 +/- 18.4 minutes and 1367 +/- 897 mGy, respectively. The mean amount of contrast material administered was 211.37 +/- 83.5 mL. Permanent neurological complications were seen in 4 patients (3%).CONCLUSION: In our experience, CS for PED placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment is feasible and safe. Procedure and fluoroscopy times and amount of radiation exposure are similar to or less than described in reports of PED placement under general anesthesia. CS allows direct neurological evaluation and earlier detection of and response to intraprocedural complications.",Excluded
3396,"KCNQ/Kv7 channel regulation of hippocampal gamma-frequency firing in the absence of synaptic transmission Synchronous neuronal firing can be induced in hippocampal slices in the absence of synaptic transmission by lowering extracellular Ca2+ and raising extracellular K+. However, the ionic mechanisms underlying this nonsynaptic synchronous firing are not well understood. In this study we have investigated the role of KCNQ/Kv7 channels in regulating this form of nonsynaptic bursting activity. Incubation of rat hippocampal slices in reduced (<0.2 mM) [Ca2+]o and increased (6.3 mM) [K+]o, blocked synaptic transmission, increased neuronal firing, and led to the development of spontaneous periodic nonsynaptic epileptiform activity. This activity was recorded extracellularly as large (4.7 +/- 1.9 mV) depolarizing envelopes with superimposed high-frequency synchronous population spikes. These intraburst population spikes initially occurred at a high frequency (about 120 Hz), which decayed throughout the burst stabilizing in the gamma-frequency band (30-80 Hz). Further increasing [K+]o resulted in an increase in the interburst frequency without altering the intraburst population spike frequency. Application of retigabine (10 microM), a Kv7 channel modulator, completely abolished the bursts, in an XE-991-sensitive manner. Furthermore, application of the Kv7 channel blockers, linopirdine (10 microM) or XE-991 (10 microM) alone, abolished the gamma frequency, but not the higher-frequency population spike firing observed during low Ca2+/high K+ bursts. These data suggest that Kv7 channels are likely to play a role in the regulation of synchronous population firing activity.",Excluded

3377,"Direct Parametric Reconstruction for Improved Characterization of Neurotransmitter Release using Dynamic PET Objectives: Kinetic analyses of dynamic PET data with reversibly binding receptor-ligand radiotracers can be used to detect endogenous neurotransmitter (NT) releases elicited by cognitive tasks or drug stimulation. Conventionally, NT release is characterized by fitting time-activity curves (TACs) with an appropriate kinetic model such as LSRRM (Alpert et al 2003), an extension of the simplified reference region model that incorporates time-varying binding due to tracer displacement by NT. A limitation of this 'indirect' approach, however, is the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the estimated parametric images. In the current work, we developed a method for estimation of LSRRM parametric maps with significantly higher SNR by direct parameter estimation from raw dynamic PET projection data. We conducted simulation and human C-raclopride studies to evaluate the performance of this method against the standard indirect method. Method(s): A numerical phantom comprised of 22 different brain regions including 7 striatal sub-divisions was created using the MNI atlas. Kinetic parameters values were assigned to each brain region based on measurements performed on 16 subjects studied with C-raclopride. Dopamine (DA) release was simulated in the striatum (executive area). LSRRM was used to generate the corresponding 4-D (i.e., 3-D + time) activity images which were then forward-projected to produce noise-free dynamic sinograms. Attenuation, detector sensitivity, point spread function and radioactive decay were modeled during sinogram data generation. After scaling to standard counts levels, Poisson noise was added to the sinograms to achieve noise levels comparable to our human studies. For empirical evaluation, a 45-min human study was conducted on the Siemens mMR camera using C-raclopride (13.5mCi). A reward task was started ~27 min after radiotracer injection to induce striatal DA release. For both simulation and human studies, parametric images of binding potential with non-displaceable reference (BP<inf>ND</inf>) and magnitude of DA release (gamma) were computed using the indirect method and the proposed direct method. For the indirect approach, parameters were estimated by pixel-wise application of LSRRM using the cerebellum as a reference tissue input and weighted least-squares fitting of TACs obtained following fully-3D dynamic OSEM reconstruction. No post-reconstruction smoothing was included. For the direct method, parameters were directly estimated from the dynamic sinograms by preconditioned conjugate gradient based optimization of a four-dimensional Poisson log-likelihood objective function incorporating LSRRM kinetics and accounting for the effects of attenuation, sensitivity, scatter and randoms. Result(s): In simulation studies, the indirect method estimated striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma with 7.8% and 79.2% bias, respectively. For the direct reconstruction, bias was reduced to 6.9% and 5.5% for striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates, respectively. Coefficients of variation ('CV', i.e. pixel-wise variability) of striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates were 65.3% and 72.0% for the indirect method as compared to 17.4% and 17.9% for the direct method. Likewise, in the human study, the direct method yielded BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma images with improved SNR. CV of BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates in the putamen were 71.4% and 91.4% for the indirect method and 32.9% and 37.6% for the direct method. Conclusion(s): Direct reconstruction can reduce bias and increase the SNR of parametric images. The method has the potential to improve the characterization of localized neurotransmitter release, potentially allowing detection of weaker effects, reducing the needed sample size, or reducing radioactivity dose to facilitate repeated experiments or minimize radiation exposure.",Excluded
2701,"Long-term results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemoresponsive tumor but overall survival remains poor even in limited disease (LD). With the aim of eradicating chemoresistant tumor cells and reducing toxicity, we investigated in this phase II trial the feasibility and outcome of a sequential approach of induction chemotherapy (CT) followed, in responding patients with LD-SCLC, by intensified platinum-based CT and concurrent thoracic irradiation (TI). Material(s) and Method(s): We treated 55 consecutive LD-SCLC patients with three 21-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, epiadriamycin and vincristine (CEV) as induction CT. In 44 (80%) patients there was an objective response and they received treatment intensification consisting of TI and concomitant CT with carboplatin and etoposide plus recombinant granulocite colony stimulating factor. Twenty-five (57%) patients were submitted to twice-daily thoracic irradiation (TDTI; 1.5 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 45 Gy) and 19 (43%) to once-daily thoracic irradiation (ODTI; 2 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 50 Gy). Result(s): Median follow up was 75 months (range, 42-102). Of 44 patients submitted to intensification with TI plus CT, 32 (73%) had a complete and 12 (27%) a partial response. Median overall survival of all 55 patients was 17 months with actuarial survival probabilities of 2 and 5 years, 32 and 25%, respectively. Analysis of patient sub-groups showed a 5-month median survival in non-responders, 19 in TDTI and 17 in ODTI patients, respectively. Two and 5 year survival probabilities were 0% in non-responders, 40 and 35% in TDTI and 39 and 21% in ODTI patients, respectively. At present, 13 of 44 responders are still alive, of which nine (20%) have been progression-free from 45 to 93 months (median 60). Treatment failure was registered in 31 (70%) of 44 patients who received both induction and intensification treatment. One-half of patients had intrathoracic recurrence, eight of which only local and the remaining seven local and distant. Fourteen (32%) patients had brain metastases. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 24 (55%) patients with no differences between treatment groups. Grade 3 esophagitis was registered in four (9%) patients: in 3/25 (12%) and 1/19 (5%) of those who received TDTI and ODTI, respectively (P=not significant). Acute radiation pneumonitis occurred in three (12%) patients submitted to TDTI. No clinically debilitating pulmonary fibrosis, permanent esophageal stricture or toxic death was observed. Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC patients late concurrent CT plus TI is feasible and effective. Our long-term results are similar to the best reported in the literature. Despite the high incidence of complete response obtained, however, one-half of the patients had intrathoracic relapse and one-third brain metastases. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

3295,"Combined endoscopic endonasal surgery and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS) for complex cranial base tumors-early clinical outcomes Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been shown to be a feasible approach to cranial base tumors while reducing post-operative morbidity. Using the endoscopic endonasal approach alone or in combination with open approaches may provide advantages over conventional approaches. However, the balance between maximal resection and minimal injury to neurovascular structures frequently precludes gross total resection (GTR). Consequently, adjuvant radiation therapy may be an important option to improve local control (LC) of residual disease. In this retrospective series, we report clinical outcomes, morbidity, and LC of 40 patients with cranial base tumors treated with EES +/- combined open approach followed by fSRS (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc.). 26 patients had benign disease, 7 had newly diagnosed malignant disease, and 7 had previously resected malignant disease. Surgical outcomes were evaluable in all patients. LC after fSRS was evaluable in 39 patients and defined as no evidence of regrowth by MRI, CT, & physical examination. GTR was achieved in 12/40. Median post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. In multivariable analysis controlling for anatomic location and malignant histology, post-operative complications (n = 10) were significantly associated with patients having combined open and EES (p < 0.01, OR = 16.9). SRS was delivered in 1-5 sessions to a median marginal dose of 24.9 Gy. Median follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1.5 to 61 months). LC was achieved in 89.7% (35/39) of evaluable patients. LC was achieved in 11/12 patients who had GTR. Median progression-free survival was 19.7 months (21.0 months for benign tumors (n = 26), 5.8 months for previously resected malignant disease (n = 7), and 21.2 months for newly diagnosed malignant disease (n = 7). Of the 31 patients who had symptomatic disease at presentation, 18 (58%) reported complete symptom resolution, 9 partial, and 4 no improvement. One patient who received two prior courses of radiation therapy developed osteosclerosis (grade III). Other adverse events were erythema (grade I, n = 5), nausea (grade II, n = 2), conjunctivitis (grade II, n = 1). EES followed by fSRS is a safe and effective management strategy for selected cranial base tumors. EES combined with an open surgical approach may result in increased complications.

3255,"Evaluation of absorbed dose in respiratory-gated radiotherapy using a phantom system that simulates patient respiration. [Japanese] Respiratory-gated (RG) radiotherapy is useful for minimizing the irradiated volume of normal tissues resulting from the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. In this technique, although improvement in the dose distribution of the target can be expected, the actual absorbed dose distribution is not clearly determined. Therefore, it is important to clarify the absorbed dose at the tumor and at the evaluation points according to the patient's respiration. We have developed a phantom system that simulates patient respiration (TNK Co., Ltd.), to evaluate the absorbed dose and ensure precise RG radiotherapy. Actual patient respiratory signals were obtained using a respiratory synchronization and gating system (AZ-733V, Anzai Medical). The acquired data were then transferred to a phantom system driven by a ball screw to simulate the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. We measured the absorbed dose using a micro-ionization chamber dosimeter and the dose distribution using the film method for RG irradiation at expiratory phase by using Linac (PRIMUS, Toshiba Medical Systems Corp.) X-rays. When the distance of phantom movement was set to the average patient respiratory movement distance of 1.5 cm, we first compared absorbed dose with RG irradiation with a gating signal of 50% or less, and without RG irradiation. The absorbed dose at the iso-center was improved by 6.0% and 4.4% at a field size of 4x4 cm2, and by 1.3% and 0.7% at a field size of 5x5 cm2 with an X-ray energy of 6 MV and 10 MV, respectively. There was, however, no dose change at a field size of 10x10 cm2 and 15x15 cm2. When the gating signal was reduced to 25% and 10%, absorbed dose was also improved. With regard to the flatness of the dose profile, no changes in dose distribution were observed in the lateral direction, e.g., beam flatness was within 1.4% and 1.6% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively, with an X-ray energy of 6 MV. In the cranial-caudal direction, the dose profile was relatively large even if a gating signal of 50% was applied, i.e., 8.1% and 10.4% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. Beam flatness without RG was much worse, i.e., 37.8% and 38.2%, at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. In both cases, the dose was insufficient in the expiratory direction. Although RG radiotherapy is quite useful, the margins in the inspiratory and expiratory phases should be considered based on the level of gating signal and field size in order to formulate appropriate radiotherapy planning in terms of the shifting of internal structures. To ensure accurate radiotherapy, the characteristics of the RG irradiation technique and the radiotherapy equipment must be clearly understood when this technique is to be employed in clinical practice.",Excluded
2838,"Up-regulation of somatostatin receptor density on rat CA20948 tumors escaped from low dose [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate therapy Aim. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using the somatostatin analogue [177Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate is a convincing treatment modality for metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Therapeutic doses are administered in 4 cycles with 6-10 week intervals. A high somatostatin receptor density on tumor cells is a prerequisite at every administration to enable effective therapy. In this study, the density of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) was investigated in the rat CA20948 pancreatic tumor model after low dose [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate administration resulting in approximately 20 Gy tumor radiation absorbed dose, whereas 60 Gy is needed to induce complete tumor regression in these and the majority of tumors. Methods. Sixteen days after inoculation of the CA20948 tumor, male Lewis rats were injected with 185 MBq [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate to initiate a decline in tumor size. Approximately 40 days after injection, tumors re-grew progressively after initial response. Quantification of sst2 expression was performed using in vitro autoradiography on frozen sections of three groups: control (not-treated) tumors, tumors in regression and tumors in re-growth. Histology and proliferation were determined using HE- and anti-Ki-67-staining. Results. The sst2 expression on CA20948 tumor cells decreased significantly after therapy to 5% of control level. However, tumors escaping from therapy showed an up-regulated sst2 level of 2-5 times higher sst2 density compared to control tumors. Conclusion. After a suboptimal therapeutic dose of [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>] octreotate, escape of tumors is likely to occur. Since these cells show an up-regulated sst2 receptor density, a next therapeutic administration of radio-labelled sst2 analogue can be expected to be highly effective.",Excluded
3590,"XAV939-mediated ARTD activity inhibition in human MB cell lines Diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases 1 and 5 (ARTD-1, ARTD-5) are poly ADP-ribose enzymes (PARP) involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is the major pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair. In addition, ARTD-5, or Tankyrase (TNKS), is a positive regulator of the WNT signaling implicated in the development and biological behavior of many neoplasms, such as Medulloblastoma (MB), in which radiotherapy is an essential part of the treatment. The use of radiosensitizing agents may improve the therapeutic index in MB patients by increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy, while reducing toxicity to the neuroaxis. ARTD-5 seems to be a good molecular target for improving the current treatment of MB. In this study, we used the small molecule XAV939, a potent ARTD-5 inhibitor with a slight affinity for ARTD-1, in different human MB cell lines. XAV939 inhibited the WNT pathway and DNA-PKcs in our MB cells, with many biological consequences. The co-administration of XAV939 and ionizing radiations (IR) inhibited MB cells proliferation and clonogenic capacity, decreased their efficacy in repairing DNA damage, and increased IR-induced cell mortality. In conclusion, our in vitro data show that XAV939 could be a very promising small molecule in MB treatment, and these results lay the basis for further in vivo studies with the aim of improving the current therapy available for MB patients.",Excluded

2924,"Effects of near-infra-red laser irradiation on adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate contents of rat brain tissue Low-power, near-infra-red laser irradiation has been used to relieve patients from various kinds of pain, though the precise mechanisms of such biological actions of the laser have not yet been resolved. To investigate the cellular mechanisms by near-infra-red laser on the nervous system, we examined the effect of 830-nm laser irradiation on the energy metabolism of the rat brain. The diode laser was applied for 15 min with an irradiance of 4.8 W/cm(2). Tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content of the irradiated area in the cerebral cortex was 19% higher than that of the non-treated area, whereas the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content showed no significant difference. Laser irradiation at another wavelength (652 nm) had no effect on either ATP or ADP contents. The temperature of the tissue was increased by 4.4-4.7 degrees C during the irradiation of both wavelengths. These results suggest that the increase in tissue ATP content did not result from the thermal effect, but from a specific effect of the laser operated at the 830-nm wavelength.",Excluded
3233,"Impact of Timing of Adjuvant Chemoradiation for Glioblastoma in a Large Hospital Database BACKGROUND: Although the standard of care for glioblastoma remains maximal safe resection followed by chemoradiation, conflicting reports have emerged regarding the importance of the time interval between these 2 treatments.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether differences in the duration between surgery and initiation of chemoradiation for glioblastoma had an impact on overall survival (OS) in a large hospital-based database.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried to identify patients diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2010 and 2012 treated with surgery followed by chemoradiation. Patients who received biopsy only were excluded. The time from surgery to initiation of radiation therapy was divided into 4 equal quartiles of <=24, 25 to 30, 31 to 37, and >37 d. Patient characteristics were compared between groups using Pearson Chi Square and Fisher's Exact test. OS was analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared via the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression were performed to assess for impact of covariables on OS.RESULTS: A total of 11 652 patients were included in the analysis. Median duration from surgery to radiation was 30 d. On multivariable regression, black race, larger tumor, gross-total resection, methyguanine-methyl transferase (MGMT+), and treatment at an academic facility were associated with a duration >30 d. On multivariable analysis, there were no significant differences when comparing start within 24 d to 25 to 30 d (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.01, P = .13) or > 37 d (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91-1.03, P = .26), although a small OS improvement was seen if initiated within 31 to 37 d (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99, P = .02).CONCLUSION: There was no clear association between duration from surgery to initiation of chemoradiation on OS.",Excluded
3364,"Thoracic and elective brain irradiation with concomitant or delayed multiagent chemotherapy in the treatment of localized small cell carcinoma of the lung: a randomized prospective study by the Southeastern Cancer Study Group A prospective randomized study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of concomitant or delayed multiagent chemotherapy combined with irradiation to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes and to the brain in a group of 70 patients with histologically proven small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. Complete and partial response in both groups was comparable, and the overall survival was comparable. However, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and irradiation in comparison with the radiotherapy alone group. Disease-free survival was higher in the concomitant chemotherapy-radiotherapy patients, although survival was not significantly modified, probably because of suboptimal chemotherapy. The initial intrathoracic failure rate was 40.7% inthe concomitant chemotherapy-irradiation group, compared with 53.8% in the radiotherapy-alone patients. None of the patients receiving delayed chemotherapy following the radiotherapy recurrence showed significant tumor response to the drugs. The incidence of distant metastasis was slightly lower in the chemotherapy groups. Brain metastases were noted in 7% of the patients in both groups. Increased intrathoracic recurrences were noted in patients with lower doses of irradiation. Nine of 13 patients treated with inadequate portals developed intrathoracic recurrences in comparison to 13 of 40 treated with adequate irradiation fields. The study emphasizes the need for intensive chemotherapy and adequate radiation therapy to improve survival of patients with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung.

2585,"Lipid peroxidation of liposomes with different ratios of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. [Chinese] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different ratios of phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol (PC/CHOL) in liposomes on lipid peroxidation. The liposomes were prepared by ultrasonication using egg yolk lecithin alone (PC, control) or with different contents of cholesterol in molar ratios of 1:0.125, 1:0.25, and 1:0.5. Conjugated dienes (CD), FOX (ferrous oxidation/xylenol orange), and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) were determined and used as indices of lipid peroxidation after incubation at 37degreeC in the presence of CuSO<inf>4</inf> over 24 h. Lipid peroxidation of the liposomes increased with increasing incubation time, irrespective of whether or not they contained cholesterol. In addition, results from the CD and FOX assays markedly increased after 2 h of incubation, while TBARS increased after 4 h of incubation. In the initial 8-h incubation, CD, FOX, and TBARS in PC/CHOL (1: 0.5) gradually decreased with increasing cholesterol contents of liposomes but were significantly higher after 24 h of incubation when compared to the control group. However, the cholesterol content of liposomes did not affect the fatty acid composition after 24 h of incubation. The results suggest that cholesterol in liposomes affects lipid peroxidation, and the oxidation status may be dependent upon incubation time.",Excluded

2800,"Microinjection of morphine into various amygdaloid nuclei differentially affects nociceptive responsiveness and RVM neuronal activity The goal of the present study was to identify nuclei of the amygdala in which opioid-sensitive systems can act to recruit nociceptive modulatory circuitry in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and affect nociceptive responsiveness. In lightly anesthetized rats, 10 microg of morphine was bilaterally microinjected into basolateral, cortical, medial, central, and lateral nuclei of the amygdala to determine the relative influence on the activity of identified ON, OFF and NEUTRAL cells in the RVM and on the latency of the tail flick reflex evoked by noxious radiant heat. Infusions of morphine into the basolateral nuclei resulted in a substantial, naloxone-reversible increase in tail flick latency, and significantly increased ongoing firing of OFF cells and depressed that of ON cells. The reflex-related changes in cell firing were also attenuated. Morphine infusions into the cortical nuclei resulted in a small (approximately 1 s) but significant increase in tail flick latency. As with basolateral microinjections, ongoing activity of the OFF cells was increased, and although the ongoing firing of ON cells was not significantly changed, the reflex-related burst that characterizes these neurons was reduced. Microinjections in the medial nuclei again altered ongoing activity of both ON cells and OFF cells. However, the duration of the OFF cell pause and tail flick latency were unchanged. NEUTRAL cells were not affected by morphine at any site. Morphine applied within the central, medial lateral and dorsal lateral nuclei had no effect on RVM neurons or on the tail flick. Thus, focal application of morphine within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala produced hypoalgesia and influenced RVM ON and OFF cells in a manner similar to that seen following systemic or RVM opioid administration. Opioid action within the medial and cortical nuclei also influenced RVM cell activity, but did not prevent the reflex-related OFF cell pause, and failed to alter the tail flick substantially. These observations, plus the lack of an opioid-activated influence from the central and lateral nuclei, demonstrate fundamental differences among systems linking the different amygdalar nuclei with the RVM. One way in which the modulatory circuitry of the RVM might be engaged physiologically in behaving animals is via opioid-mediated activation of the basolateral nucleus.",Excluded
2700,"Brain enzyme histochemistry following stabilization by microwave irradiation The activities of various enzymes present in brain homogenates were assayed biochemically (a) with no pretreatment, (b) following a standard microwave treatment in saline and (c) after a standard microwave treatment in formalin. All enzyme activity was lost after the microwave - formalin in treatment. Following microwave - saline treatment, the activities of alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, isocitrate and succinate dehydrogenases were reduced. In contrast, the activities of lactate and malate dehydrogenases were unchanged, and that of acetylcholinesterase apparently increased. Analogous outcomes were seen following attempted histochemical demonstrations of these enzymes. Thus satisfactory histochemical demonstration of all enzymes was achieved (except with alkaline phosphatase, lactate and malate dehydrogenases) following the microwave-saline pretreatment. Since acid phosphatase, catalase and peroxidase were also successfully demonstrated, it seems that microwave-saline pretreatments permit both retention of sufficient enzyme activity for histochemical demonstration to occur and retention of sufficient structural integrity for critical morphological investigations. Since the failure to stain the sites of lactate and malate dehydrogenases is not due to microwave inactivation of these enzymes, their demonstration may be possible by varying the staining procedures.",Excluded

2882,"Focused ultrasound-mediated suppression of chemically-induced acute epileptic EEG activity BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is attributed to uncontrollable abnormal hyper-excitability of neurons. We investigated the feasibility of using low-intensity, pulsed radiation of focused ultrasound (FUS) to non-invasively suppress epileptic activity in an animal model (rat), which was induced by the intraperitonial injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ).RESULTS: After the onset of induced seizures, FUS was transcranially administered to the brain twice for three minutes each while undergoing electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. An air-backed, spherical segment ultrasound transducer (diameter: 6 cm; radius-of-curvature: 7 cm) operating at a fundamental frequency of 690 KHz was used to deliver a train of 0.5 msec-long pulses of sonication at a repetitive rate of 100 Hz to the thalamic areas of the brain. The acoustic intensity (130 mW/cm2) used in the experiment was sufficiently within the range of safety guidelines for the clinical ultrasound imaging. The occurrence of epileptic EEG bursts from epilepsy-induced rats significantly decreased after sonication when it was compared to the pre-sonication epileptic state. The PTZ-induced control group that did not receive any sonication showed a sustained number of epileptic EEG signal bursts. The animals that underwent sonication also showed less severe epileptic behavior, as assessed by the Racine score. Histological analysis confirmed that the sonication did not cause any damage to the brain tissue.CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that low-intensity, pulsed FUS sonication suppressed the number of epileptic signal bursts using acute epilepsy model in animal. Due to its non-invasiveness and spatial selectivity, FUS may offer new perspectives for a possible non-invasive treatment of epilepsy.",Excluded
3406,"Small Cell Lung Cancer: Therapies and Targets Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a fatal disease due to limited therapeutic options. Systemic chemotherapy is the bedrock of treatment for both the limited and extensive stages of the disease. However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC.

3595,"Posture, locomotion, spatial orientation, and motion sickness as a function of space flight This article summarizes a variety of newly published findings obtained by the Neuroscience Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and attempts to place this work within a historical framework of previous results on posture, locomotion, motion sickness, and perceptual responses that have been observed in conjunction with space flight. In this context, we have taken the view that correct transduction and integration of signals from all sensory systems is essential to maintaining stable vision, postural and locomotor control, and eye-hand coordination as components of spatial orientation. The plasticity of the human central nervous system allows individuals to adapt to altered stimulus conditions encountered in a microgravity environment. However, until some level of adaptation is achieved, astronauts and cosmonauts often experience space motion sickness, disturbances in motion control and eye-hand coordination, unstable vision, and illusory motion of the self, the visual scene, or both. Many of the same types of disturbances encountered in space flight reappear immediately after crew members return to earth. The magnitude of these neurosensory, sensory-motor and perceptual disturbances, and the time needed to recover from them, tend to vary as a function of mission duration and the space travelers prior experience with the stimulus rearrangement of space flight. To adequately chart the development of neurosensory changes associated with space flight, we recommend development of enhanced eye movement systems and body position measurement. We also advocate the use of a human small radius centrifuge as both a research tool and as a means of providing on-orbit countermeasures that will lessen the impact of living for long periods of time with out exposure to altering gravito-inertial forces.",Excluded

This inhibition could impair motor function of the affected hand. We investigated if inhibitory 1~Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralesional M1 improved motor performance of the affected hand in acute stroke.METHODS: A double-blind study of real versus placebo rTMS was conducted. Twelve patients early after subcortical stroke (mean: 7 days) received 1200 stimuli of real and placebo rTMS in a crossover design. The sequence of stimulations was counterbalanced across subjects. Stimulus intensity was subthreshold (90% of motor threshold at rest). Motor function was tested by grip strength recordings and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) executions before and after each rTMS session.RESULTS: Compared to sham stimulation, real rTMS improved NHPT results but not grip strength in the affected hand. No change of performance was observed for the unaffected hand. NHPT baseline repetitions in a subgroup of patients indicated stable motor performance prior to the rTMS sessions.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that therapeutic rTMS applications over the contralesional hemisphere are feasible in acute stroke patients and can transiently improve dexterity of the affected hand.

Patients with large tumors at presentation which are close to dose-limiting structures such as the optic chiasm and brain stem may pose a challenging clinical problem. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) prior to CRT can be used to shrink the tumor and may therefore be a valuable strategy to optimize treatment planning. Studies in Asia have reported favorable outcomes with NC for NPC. The goal of this study was to characterize the patterns of use of NC for NPC at a Canadian center. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of locally advanced NPC patients treated between 2000 and 2013. Patients who received NC with the intention to downsize locally advanced tumors prior to CRT were included. Baseline demographics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy treatments, and follow-up data were obtained from institutional databases and chart review and analyzed with SPSS. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local regional relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions. Result(s): Forty-six patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 47 (range 18-75). Eighty percent of patients were male, 74% were of Asian ethnicity, and 87% had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Ninetyfour percent of patients had T3 or T4 tumors; 80% were node positive; 26% stage III, 67% IVA, 4% IVB. NC regimens included cisplatin/gemcitabine 87%, cisplatin/fluorouracil 6%, and cisplatin/etoposide 6%. The total neoadjuvant dose of cisplatin received ranged from 24mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 325 mg/m<sup>2</sup> with a median dose of 160mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most common dose fractionations prescribed were 70 Gy in 35fractions for 67% of cases and 66 Gy in 33 fractions for 13%. Forty-two of the 46 patients went on to receive CRT, and the total concurrent cisplatin dose delivered was <200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 21 patients (46%) and >200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 25 patients (54%). In multivariate analysis of the 42 patients who received concurrent chemotherapy, the ability to deliver over 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> concurrent chemotherapy with radiation was not impacted by the dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, age, sex, ECOG, or ethnicity. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (0.17-10.6 years). Twenty-three percent of patients had a local recurrence, 13% developed distant metastases, and there were 7 deaths, 6 deaths due to NPC. The 3- year PFS was 67%, LRFS 74%, DMFS 86%, DSS 86%, and OS was 83%. Conclusion(s): NPC patients have been treated with NC at this center with favorable outcomes. Most patients tolerated CRT after NC, and half of patients received 5 or more concurrent cycles. The dose of NC given did not lower the dose concurrent chemotherapy later tolerated. This institution is currently evaluating the volumetric impact of NC on tumor size while we await the results of ongoing randomized trials of NC followed by CRT in this patient population.",Excluded

We previously reported that DLC is not toxic to N2a neuroblastoma cells or primary cortical neurons and showed that phosphorus-doped DLC (P:DLC) could be used to produce patterned neuron networks.

Although the physical half-life of thallium-201 chloride is 73 hours, its biological half-life is often more than 3.5 times that. Following intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride it is concentrated in the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland, testes or ovaries, and then eventually decays to mercury. Because of its relatively long physical & biological half-lives, thallium-201 chloride may produce mild radiation injury while it remains radioactive. Similar injuries may be induced by technetium-99m (often used for brain SPECT), which radiates Gamma rays (140 KeV), but since its physical half-life is only 6 hours, the side effects are not as significant as those of thallium-201 chloride. Since the main component of thallium-201 chloride radiation is X-ray (68-82 KeV), which consists of photons with a very short wavelength and a high penetrating power, prolonged exposure can induce electromagnetic field-induced injury. As a previous study of the principal author on electromagnetic field exposure indicated, electromagnetic field-induced injury causes the change of L-amino acids to D-amino acids. 2 days after SPECT study of the heart with intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride, the principal author experienced shortness of breath, loss of appetite, dizziness, fever, and general malaise within the week, and found a progressively significant increase in D-glutamic acid and decrease in L-glutamic acid peaking 2 weeks after the initial injection but lasting for many weeks after in organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland & testes, where radioactive substances had accumulated and radiation was at an average of about 400 counts/min. Even 2 months after the initial injection, the abnormal ratio of D-amino acids and L-amino acids had not returned to normal (in the radiation exposed heart, L-amino acids: 6 mg/dl with D-amino acids: 5 mg/dl; normal tissue, L-amino acids: 10 mg/dl with D-amino acids < 1 mg/dl). The principal author tried to find a safe method of reducing possible radiation injury and accelerating the elimination of the already deposited mercury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded
2623,"Successful prevention from acute rejection in human hand allograft. [Chinese] Aim: To explore the prevention of acute rejection in human band allograft. Method(s): Two male patients underwent right hand allograft in the Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University on 21st September 1999. In the two patients, the right hand of one was exploded when exploding the fish and underwent initially fitting; the right wrist of the other was carved by steel-wire and underwent fitting after the failure replantation two years ago. On 26th September 2000, another patient with traumatic both forearms amputation underwent the hand allograft, whose both forearms were injured in explosion one year ago, with deletion in 1/3 middle and lower of the right forearm and 1/3 middle and upper of the left forearm. The 3 patients had normal psychological and immune state without systemic disease, and their disabled limb condition was better, which requested urgently hand allograft. Three brain-dead donors were matched respectively to ABO- and Rh-compatible, HIA-half compatible. After removed the marrow of ulnar and radial bone by scraping, two of the donor's arms was irrigated with 8 Gy X-ray; The artery, vein and nerve of the patients were anastomosed under microscope combined with immunosuppressants. T-lymphocyte subsets and cytokine were dynamically detected. Result(s):(1) General condition, transplanted hand skin and histopathologic examination of the patients: After transplantation, the vital signs were stable, and the circulation of the transplanted hands was satisfactory. No bacteria, virus or fungal infection were found. The skin healing was fused with the replanted limb, all the grafted hands survived. No acute rejection reaction was found in the clinical symptoms, physical signs and skin pathologic examination.(2) Dynamic detection of cytokine in peripheral blood: The level of serum interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor ot(TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma(IFN-gamma) were descent quickly within the first post-transplantation week and returned at induction period of inummosuppressive agent, but remained at low level. Conclusion(s): Tissue matching with donor, reasonable handle of donor limbs, individualized inummosupressants, refined and exact microsurgical technology, and effective infection prevention can prevent acute rejection. Monitoring of serum IL-2, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the peripheral blood of patients is helpful to judge the occurrence of acute rejection.",Excluded
2815,"Retreatment of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma Thirty patients with recurrent primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma were reirradiated between 1949 and 1976. Twenty eventually demonstrated recurrence at or near the primary site, involving the nasopharynx in 4 and the central nervous system in 16. Long-term palliation was often achieved, and there were no severe complications except for one patient who died of necrosis of the base of the skull. The most frequent problems were hearing loss and trismus; necrosis of the nasopharynx was seen in only 2 patients. With therapy in the range of 18-25 MeV, significant palliation and an occasional cure can be achieved without excessive risk. Recurrent disease involving the skull may be controlled for several years using current techniques.",Excluded
3474,"Nuclear double-fluorescent reporter for in vivo and ex vivo analyses of biological transitions in mouse nuclei Cre-responsive dual-fluorescent alleles allow in situ marking of cell lineages or genetically modified cells. Here we report a dual-fluorescent allele, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> , which directs nuclear accumulation of tdTomato in Cre-naive lineages. Cre converts the allele to ROSA <sup>nG</sup> , which drives nuclear EGFP accumulation. Conditions were established for analyzing marked nuclei by flow cytometry on the basis of red-green fluorescence and ploidy, with a particular focus on liver nuclei. Hydrodynamic delivery of a Cre-expression plasmid was used to time-stamp arbitrary hepatocytes for lineage tracing. The distinct green fluorescence of nuclei from Cre-exposed lineages facilitated analyses of ploidy transitions within clones. To assess developmental transitions in liver nuclei, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> was combined with the hepatocyte-specific AlbCre transgene, facilitating discrimination between hepatocyte and nonhepatocyte nuclei. Nuclei extracted from postnatal day 2 (P2) livers were 41 % green and 59 % red and reached a stable level of 84 % green by P22. Until P20, green nuclei were >98 % diploid (2N); at P40 they were ~56 % 2N, 43 % 4N, and <1 % 8N; and by P70 they reached a stable distribution of ~46 % 2N, 45 % 4N, and 9 % 8N. In conclusion, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> will facilitate in vivo and ex vivo studies on liver and will likely be valuable for studies on tissues like muscle, kidney, or brain in which cells are refractory to whole-cell flow cytometry, or like trophectoderm derivatives or cancers in which cells undergo ploidy transitions.",Excluded
3638,"Structure of the toxic core of alpha-synuclein from invisible crystals The protein alpha-synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies, the neuron-associated aggregates seen in Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative pathologies. An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore, appears to be responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of human alpha-synuclein. Here we describe crystals of NACore that have dimensions smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus are invisible by optical microscopy. As the crystals are thousands of times too small for structure determination by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we use micro-electron diffraction to determine the structure at atomic resolution. The 1.4 A resolution structure demonstrates that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures and here yields, to our knowledge, the highest resolution achieved by any cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure exhibits protofibrils built of pairs of face-to-face beta-sheets. X-ray fibre diffraction patterns show the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length alpha-synuclein. The NACore structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length alpha-synuclein fibril, presenting opportunities for the design of inhibitors of alpha-synuclein fibrils.",Excluded
