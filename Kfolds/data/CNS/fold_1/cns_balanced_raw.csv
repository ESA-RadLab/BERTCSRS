5,"Effects of spaceflight on ocular counterrolling and the spatial orientation of the vestibular system. We recorded the horizontal (yaw), vertical (pitch), and torsional (roll) eye movements of two rhesus monkeys with scleral search coils before and after the COSMOS Biosatellite 2229 Flight. The aim was to determine effects of adaptation to microgravity on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The animals flew for 11 days. The first postflight tests were 22 h and 55 h after landing, and testing extended for 11 days after reentry. There were four significant effects of spaceflight on functions related to spatial orientation: (1) Compensatory ocular counterrolling (OCR) was reduced by about 70% for static and dynamic head tilts with regard to gravity. The reduction in OCR persisted in the two animals throughout postflight testing. (2) The gain of the torsional component of the angular VOR (roll VOR) was decreased by 15% and 50% in the two animals over the same period. (3) An up-down asymmetry of nystagmus, present in the two monkeys before flight was reduced after exposure to microgravity. (4) The spatial orientation of velocity storage was shifted in the one monkey that could be tested soon after flight. Before flight, the yaw axis eigenvector of optokinetic afternystagmus was close to gravity when the animal was upright or tilted. After flight, the yaw orientation vector was shifted toward the body yaw axis. By 7 days after recovery, it had reverted to a gravitational orientation. We postulate that spaceflight causes changes in the vestibular system which reflect adaptation of spatial orientation from a gravitational to a body frame of reference. These changes are likely to play a role in the postural, locomotor, and gaze instability demonstrated on reentry after spaceflight.",Included

47,"A Comparison between X-Ray and Carbon Ion Irradiation in Human Neural Stem Cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by a poor prognosis and a median survival of ~12-18 months. GBM is usually managed by neurosurgery followed by both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since GBM develops resistance to conventional therapies, treatment with C-ions is promising to completely eradicate the tumoural mass. During cranial irradiation, exposure of healthy tissues is inevitable. Because of the presence of neural stem cells, a deep investigation on the effects of C-ion irradiation with respect to X-ray induced damage is mandatory to allow a better definition of treatments. In this work, the comparison of X-rays and C-ion irradiation-induced effects on human neural stem cell, focusing on multiple endpoints, such as cell viability, cytokine secretion and spheroid formation is presented. Results show different temporal and dose responses of human neural stem cells to the different radiation qualities, suggesting different underpinning mechanisms of radiation-induced damages.",Included

This paper evaluates the hearing status in the long-term, of patients who have had radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and also discusses the hearing losses from a disability point of view, which takes into account binaural hearing. Forty patients who have had NPC successfully treated by a single radical course of radiotherapy of 70-80 Gy were studied at 2-12 years (mean 6.2 years) after radiotherapy. Each patient was examined clinically and with a pure-tone audiogram. Averaged hearing thresholds over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz were evaluated and a value > 30 dB was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with age-matched controls. The median hearing threshold for each ear in NPC patients was found to be 31.9 dB (range 10.0-86.3 dB) and that for controls 17.5 dB (7.5-38.8 dB) (P < 0.0005, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test). In NPC patients, 44 ears (55.0%) had abnormal hearing, of which 17 (21.3%), 5 (6.3%) and 22 (27.5%) ears had predominantly sensori-neural, conductive and mixed hearing losses, respectively. Nineteen ears had middle ear effusions, accounting for the majority of mixed and conductive hearing losses. In terms of individual patients, 8 (20.0%) and 18 (45.0%) patients had abnormal hearing in one year (monaural hearing disability) and both ears (binaural hearing disability), respectively. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients who have had radiotherapy for NPC, have hearing disability in the long-term, as compared to normal controls.",Included

101,"Radiation Induces Distinct Changes in Defined Subpopulations of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells in the Adult Hippocampus. While irradiation can effectively treat brain tumors, this therapy also causes cognitive impairments, some of which may stem from the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. To study how radiation affects neurogenesis, we combine phenotyping of subpopulations of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells with double- and triple S-phase labeling paradigms. Using this approach, we reveal new features of division, survival, and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells after exposure to gamma radiation. We show that dividing neural stem cells, while susceptible to damage induced by gamma rays, are less vulnerable than their rapidly amplifying progeny. We also show that dividing stem and progenitor cells that survive irradiation are suppressed in their ability to replicate 0.5-1 day after the radiation exposure. Suppression of division is also observed for cells that entered the cell cycle after irradiation or were not in the S phase at the time of exposure. Determining the longer term effects of irradiation, we found that 2 months after exposure, radiation-induced suppression of division is partially relieved for both stem and progenitor cells, without evidence for compensatory symmetric divisions as a means to restore the normal level of neurogenesis. By that time, most mature young neurons, born 2-4 weeks after the irradiation, still bear the consequences of radiation exposure, unlike younger neurons undergoing early stages of differentiation without overt signs of deficient maturation. Later, 6 months after an exposure to 5 Gy, cell proliferation and neurogenesis are further impaired, though neural stem cells are still available in the niche, and their pool is preserved. Our results indicate that various subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus have different susceptibility to gamma radiation, and that neurogenesis, even after a temporary restoration, is impaired in the long term after exposure to gamma rays. Our study provides a framework for investigating critical issues of neural stem cell maintenance, aging, interaction with their microenvironment, and post-irradiation therapy.",Included
108,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer: findings from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group pooled analysis. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (>=70 years of age) from a pooled analysis of four prospective trials.MATERIALS & METHODS: One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.",Included
111,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles. Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation.",Included

The group of liquidators of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident (n=170) with nonpsychotic mental disorders of exogenic-organic origin was studied. Patients were stratified into five groups on the basis of dominating symptoms in different stages of disorders: group 1 included patients with the prevalence of asthenic symptoms (n=104); group 2 - with the prevalence of autonomous disorders (n=37); group 3 - with the marked neurotic-like symptom complex (n=10); group 4 - with depressive symptoms (n=10); group 5 - with disturbances of cognitive function.

Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included

Mice were exposed to 1 month of spaceflight on Russian biosatellite BION-M1 to determine its effect on the expression of key genes in the brain dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems. Spaceflight decreased the expression of crucial genes involved in DA synthesis and degradation, as well as the D1 receptor. However, spaceflight failed to alter the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-2, 5-HT transporter, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT3 receptor genes, though it reduced 5-HT2A receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus. We revealed risk DA and 5-HT neurogenes for long-term spaceflight for the first time, as well as microgravity-responsive genes (tyrosine hydroxylase, catechol-O-methyltransferase, and D1 receptor in the nigrostriatal system; D1 and 5-HT2A receptors in the hypothalamus; and monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) in the frontal cortex).

We evaluated the effects of low-dose gamma-irradiation at a low-dose-rate on the FST-induced depletion of antioxidants in mouse organs. Mice received whole-body low-dose-rate (0.6 or 3.0 mGy/h) of low-dose gamma-irradiation for 1 week, followed by daily FSTs (5 days). The immobility rate on day 2 compared to day 1 was significantly lower in the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice than in sham irradiated mice. The FST significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) activity and total glutathione (t-GSH) content in the brain and kidney, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and t-GSH content in the liver of the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice were significantly lower than those of the non-FST-treated mice. The CAT activity in the lungs of mice exposed to 3.0 mGy/h gamma-irradiation was higher than that of non-FST treated mice and mice treated with FST. However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these antioxidant markers between the sham and irradiated groups except for the CAT activity in lungs. These findings suggest that the effects of low-dose-rate and low-dose gamma-irradiation on FST are highly organ-dependent.",Included

153,"Systemic HDAC3 inhibition ameliorates impairments in synaptic plasticity caused by simulated galactic cosmic radiation exposure in male mice. Deep space travel presents a number of measurable risks including exposure to a spectrum of radiations of varying qualities, termed galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that are capable of penetrating the spacecraft, traversing through the body and impacting brain function. Using rodents, studies have reported that exposure to simulated GCR leads to cognitive impairments associated with changes in hippocampus function that can persist as long as one-year post exposure with no sign of recovery. Whether memory can be updated to incorporate new information in mice exposed to GCR is unknown. Further, mechanisms underlying long lasting impairments in cognitive function as a result of GCR exposure have yet to be defined. Here, we examined whether whole body exposure to simulated GCR using 6 ions and doses of 5 or 30 cGy interfered with the ability to update an existing memory or impact hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism believed to underlie memory processes, by examining long term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle aged male mice 3.5-5 months after radiation exposure. Using a modified version of the hippocampus-dependent object location memory task developed by our lab termed ""Objects in Updated Locations"" (OUL) task we find that GCR exposure impaired hippocampus-dependent memory updating and hippocampal LTP 3.5-5 months after exposure. Further, we find that impairments in LTP are reversed through one-time systemic subcutaneous injection of the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP 966 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that long lasting impairments in cognitive function may be mediated at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms.",Included
161,"Irradiation inactivation studies of the dopamine D1 receptor and dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat striatum. In frozen rat striatal tissue, exposed to 10 MeV electrons from a linear accelerator, the sizes of the dopamine (DA) D1 receptor and the DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase complex were determined using target size analysis. The number of D1 receptors (labelled by [3H]SCH 23390) declined monoexponentially with increasing radiation intensity, yielding a molecular weight (mol.wt.) of 80 kDa. Also the activity of the catalytic unit (C) of the adenylate cyclase (as measured by forskolin stimulation), decreased monoexponentially, however with a mol.wt. of 145 kDa. Both basal, DA- and fluoride (F-)-stimulated activity declined in a concave-downward fashion with a limiting mol.wt. of 134, 138 and 228 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that the basal and DA-stimulated activity originated from an enzyme complex with a mol.wt. of 325 kDa, a value close to the combined size of RGs and C. These data suggest that F- stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, which occurs by a Gs activation, does not cause dissociation of Gs into the alpha s and beta gamma subunits. Further, the DA-regulated adenylate cyclase apparently exists as a complex consisting of RGs and C; the mechanism of hormonal activation is a dissociation of C from this complex.",Included
169,"Study of antioxidative effects and anti-inflammatory effects in mice due to low-dose X-irradiation or radon inhalation. Low-dose irradiation induces various stimulating effects, especially activation of the biological defense system including antioxidative and immune functions. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cell damage and death and can induce many types of diseases. This paper reviews new insights into inhibition of ROS-related diseases with low-dose irradiation or radon inhalation. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before or after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment inhibits hepatopathy in mice. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before ischemia-reperfusion injury or cold-induced brain injury also inhibits edema. These findings suggest that low-dose X-irradiation has antioxidative effects due to blocking the damage induced by free radicals or ROS. Moreover, radon inhalation increases superoxide dismutase activity in many organs and inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. These findings suggest that radon inhalation also has antioxidative effects. This antioxidative effect against CCl4-induced hepatopathy is comparable to treatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at a dose of 500 mg/kg weight, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment at a dose of 300 mg/kg weight, and is due to activation of antioxidative functions. In addition, radon inhalation inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema, suggesting that radon inhalation has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, radon inhalation inhibits formalin-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that radon inhalation relieves pain. Thus, low-dose irradiation very likely activates the defense systems in the body, and therefore, contributes to preventing or reducing ROS-related injuries, which are thought to involve peroxidation.",Included

Background: Limb salvage surgery of popliteal soft tissue sarcomas may be hampered due to the incomplete anatomical containment of this region and the vicinity of neurovascular structures. The scope of this study was to determine outcome and to define risk factors. Patients and Methods: 27 patients (53.3 +/- 15.8 y; 16/27 male) with popliteal soft tissue sarcomas were assessed. Mean follow-up was 40.9 +/- 33.8 months (48.5 +/- 36.7 months in surviving patients). 9/27 patients were included after prior treatment elsewhere (5 after intralesional resections and 4 local recurrences). The lesions were staged IB in 8/27 patients, IIB in 17/27 and III in 2/27. Immediate amputations were performed in 7/27 patients. 15/27 patients were subjected to radiation therapy (preoperative in 6/15 cases), 8/27 patients received chemotherapy (5/8 preoperatively). Result(s): Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 y was 63.0% and 59.5%. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. 8/27 patients developed metastatic disease after 28.9 +/- 9.8 months. Survival (p = 0.397) and disease-free survival (p = 0.113) did not differ in patients after amputations vs limb salvage. Application of radiation therapy was associated with a better survival (p = 0.003). Complications related to the surgical intervention were recorded in 2/27 patients, complications related to radiation therapy occurred in 6/15 patients.

Radiation is a widely used treatment for head and neck cancers, and one of its most severe side effects is ototoxicity. Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts. The results of this study suggest that p38 plays an important role in mediating radiation-induced ototoxicity and inhibition of p38 could be a plausible option for preventing radiation ototoxicity.",Included

Most of them were exposed to the doses of radiation meeting criteria of so-called ""low doses"": 5 - 100 cGy. The impact of these doses on human health is not fully researched; mainly it refers to mental disorders. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and pathological patterns of formation of mental disorders in liquidators exposed to ""low doses"" of radiation because of the Chernobyl accident. A group of 500 liquidators was examined in a continuous research during 1995-1999 and in 2000-2001. Clinical, clinicalpsychological and psychophysiological methods were mainly used; biochemical blood analysis and functional studies also were used. Change in clinical parameters and survey results were observed in the dynamics. Primary morbidity: a separate group of ""cerebrovascular disorders"" was highlighted. In 1989 it accounted for 14 % of primary morbidity, digestive diseases - 9%, and respiratory diseases - 45 %. In 1994, vascular disorders accounted for 43 %, respiratory diseases - 7% , and the digestive diseases - 25; In 1998 cerebral vascular disorders took first place in the primary morbidity, alongside with the increase of combined diverse classes ""neoplasm"", ""endocrine system disorders"" and ""blood diseases"". Disability: In 1990 cerebrovascular disorders occupied 37 % of all cases of disability, in 1993 - 84% of all disability. These disorders consisted of 90% cerebral disorders and had a tendency to deteriorate over time. We have shown that by the year 1998-1999 the psychoorganic syndrome was presented in 65% of liquidators, and in 83% of cases because of the cerebral vascular disorders. The following clinical forms were described: affective (80%), psychopathic (14.8%), and dementic (5.2%). Over time among the liquidators the number of diseases of various organs and systems are increasing. Among these diseases, cerebrovascular disease comes first; organic CNS lesion (radiation encephalopathy) results in clinically detectable psychoorganic syndrome in the major group of examined liquidators.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiotherapy decreases the risk for local recurrence and improves overall survival in women with breast cancer. We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001).

The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women.",Included
244,"Does radiation exposure portend worse postoperative outcomes after cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign indications?. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative radiation exposure is traditionally thought to correlate with increased postoperative complications after cystectomy with urinary diversion (CxUD) for benign indications. We assessed postoperative outcomes among patients who received CxUD, stratified by radiation exposure. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients undergoing CxUD over a 10 year period encompassed demographics, operative parameters, 30 and 90 day readmission and complications. CxUD for malignant indications and in patients below 18 years of age were excluded. Chi-square and t-test analyses assessed demographics and indications. Complications were measured by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Among 103 patients, 39 (38%) had radiation exposure prior to CxUD. Mean age for patients with radiation exposure undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion was significantly higher (69.8 vs 59.7 years, p=0.001).

There was a significant correlation between radiation exposure and having a preoperative diagnosis of genitourinary fistulae (p=0.001), neurogenic bladder (p<0.0001) and urethral stricture (p=0.002). Radiation exposure did not correlate to readmission at 30 days (p=0.256) or at 90 days (p=0.576). Ureteroileal strictures requiring interventional radiology procedures were observed in 6 patients (5.8%) and stomal stenosis was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). Neither variable was correlated with radiation exposure (p=0.27 and p=0.265, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In spite of patients being older with more comorbidities at baseline, patients with preoperative radiation exposure undergoing CxUD for benign indications did not have increased readmission at 30 or 90 days or increased complications postoperatively. Additionally, operative parameters such as surgery time, estimated blood loss and length of stay were similar between radiation and naive patient groups. These findings suggest radiation exposure prior to CxUD may not portend as negative consequences as once thought.",Included

267,"Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) improves learning after radiation stress. Brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high utilization of oxygen and rather poorly developed antioxidative defense mechanism. Free radicals formation is greatly augmented during ionizing radiation exposure, which causes damage in cerebellum responsible for locomotor activity. Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) having high content of beta-carotene (about 15 mg/100g), ascorbic acid, Vitamin C and folate, may prove efficient antioxidants. To evaluate its antioxidative efficacy, healthy Swiss albino mice from an inbred colony were selected and divided into three groups having equal number of male and female in each group. All of these animals were initially trained in Hebb William's Maze, model D(1). After initial training of 10 days, two groups were supplemented with methanolic extract of A. paniculatus (Linn.) at a dose of 600 and 800 mg/kg bw per day, respectively for 15 days. One group without any treatment served as normal. It has been observed that mice, supplemented with extract took lesser time to reach goal than normal (without any treatment). Furthermore after supplementation of Amaranthus, followed by exposure to 9 Gy of gamma radiation by 60Co beam therapy unit, the survived mice took lesser time to reach to their goals than those without plant extract. Control mice (not supplemented with AE extract) showed continuous decline in their learning performance. Mice of Control group died within 12 days after exposure. Irradiated males try to recover from 10th day onwards but they died up to day 12. But in Experimental mice (AE treated), after initial decline in learning ability after exposure, recovery was noticed and not only this 70% of them survived beyond the observation period. Besides male mice showed faster learning ability as compared to females in all groups. After irradiation too, males took lesser time to reach to goals. Learning in all the groups before exposure has been much faster in between 9 and 15 days. After radiation, however it was followed by a sudden spurt and delayed learning response up to 12 days. Recovery was greater in males than females in treated groups. Recovery was greater in males of 600 mg/kg bw per day than other groups. Learning has been almost at the same level from 14th day onward, which indicates that both the dose levels have been found equally effective.",Included
272,"Paralysis following stereotactic spinal irradiation in pigs suggests a tolerance constraint for single-session irradiation of the spinal nerve. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Paralysis observed during a study of vertebral bone tolerance to single-session irradiation led to further study of the dose-related incidence of motor peripheral neuropathy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a bone tolerance study, cervical spinal nerves of 15 minipigs received bilateral irradiation to levels C5-C8 distributed into three dose groups with mean maximum spinal nerve doses of 16.9 +/- 0.3 Gy (n=5), 18.7 +/- 0.5 Gy (n=5), and 24.3 +/- 0.8 Gy (n=5). Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal. Irradiated spinal nerve regions showed increased thickness and hypointensity on MR imaging.CONCLUSION: The single-session tolerance dose of the cervical spinal nerves lies between 19.0 and 24.1 Gy for this model.",Included

PURPOSE: Investigation of the effects of hyperthermia on the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord with respect to: (a) incidence of paralysis, (b) latency, (c) histopathology, and (d) tumor induction.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Rat lumbosacral spinal cord with the cauda equina was single-dose irradiated with 15 to 32 Gy of x-rays. Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat. Second, latency for paralysis was shortened in the lower dose range. Third, no difference in pathology between x-rays alone or in combination with hyperthermia. Fourth, hyperthermia did increase radiation carcinogenesis.",Included

Total combination of the changes in ultrastructure of the blood capillaries and perivascular astrocytes makes it possible to suppose that permeability of the microvascular bed wall is increased. At this period, together with the destructive changes there are evidently certain compensatory-restorative processes, developing in the cerebral tissue. It is possible to suppose that already during the first hours after the radiation the ultrastructural changes of neurons are resulted not only from the direct effect of radiation, but from certain influences of the radiation damage of neuroglia and microvessels.",Included
317,"Simulated Microgravity and Low-Dose/Low-Dose-Rate Radiation Induces Oxidative Damage in the Mouse Brain. Microgravity and radiation are stressors unique to the spaceflight environment that can have an impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These stressors could potentially lead to significant health risks to astronauts, both acutely during the course of a mission or chronically, leading to long-term, post-mission decrements in quality of life. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to high concentrations of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids and low levels of antioxidant defenses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative damage in the brain cortex and hippocampus in a ground-based model for spaceflight, which includes prolonged unloading and low-dose radiation. Whole-body low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma radiation using (57)Co plates (0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) was delivered to 6 months old, mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-6/group) to simulate the radiation component. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Brains were isolated 7 days or 9 months after irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for characterization of oxidative stress markers and microvessel changes. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, was significantly elevated in the cortex and hippocampus after LDR + HLU compared to controls (P < 0.05). The combination group also had the highest level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression compared to controls (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the animals that received HLU only or combined LDR + HLU compared to control (P < 0.05). In addition, 9 months after LDR and HLU exposure, microvessel densities were the lowest in the combination group, compared to age-matched controls in the cortex (P < 0.05). Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers that may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress.",Included

The safety of space flight is challenged by a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that may compromise the health and performance of astronauts. The molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy and decreased performance have been studied mostly after short duration flights and are still not fully elucidated. By deciphering the muscle proteome changes elicited in mice after a full month aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, we observed that the antigravity soleus incurred the greatest changes compared with locomotor muscles. Proteomics data notably suggested mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic and fiber type switching toward glycolytic type II fibers, structural alterations, and calcium signaling-related defects to be the main causes for decreased muscle performance in flown mice. Alterations of the protein balance, mTOR pathway, myogenesis, and apoptosis were expected to contribute to muscle atrophy. Moreover, several signs reflecting alteration of telomere maintenance, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance were found as possible additional deleterious effects. Finally, 8 days of recovery post flight were not sufficient to restore completely flight-induced changes. Thus in-depth proteomics analysis unraveled the complex and multifactorial remodeling of skeletal muscle structure and function during long-term space flight, which should help define combined sets of countermeasures before, during, and after the flight.",Included

411,"Impaired Attentional Set-Shifting Performance after Exposure to 5 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si Particles. Astronauts on deep space missions will be required to work more autonomously than on previous missions, and thus their ability to perform executive functions could be critical to mission success. One of the most common measures of executive function in humans is the ability to perform attentional set shifting, which requires contributions from working memory, discrimination, reversal learning, attentional set shifting and attention. Rodent attentional set shifting assays require rats to form an association between the presence of the food reward and an associative cue, which is either the digging media or the scent that is placed in the bowl; by altering the combination of scent and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. In this study, we have determined the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si particles has on the ability of male retired breeder Wistar rats to perform attentional set shifting at three months postirradiation. All doses of Si resulted in a significant impairment in the ability of the rats to perform the first and most simple step of the ATSET assay, the simple discrimination (SD) task. If astronauts were to experience HZE-induced SD impairments, they would be unable to identify key factors to successfully resolve a situation. Performance in at least one other component of the ATSET test was impaired at all doses studied, however, these varied according to the dose. Compared with our previous studies using 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>48</sup>Ti particles, 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si ions impaired attentional set-shifting performance at lower doses than the heavier ions. However, when the effect of isofluences of the three HZE ions were compared, there were no significant differences in the severity of the impaired performance; there were, however, ion-specific decrements in the ability of rats to perform within the various stages of the test. This study further supports the notion that ""mission-relevant"" doses of HZE particles (<20 cGy) can impair certain aspects of attentional set-shifting performance in retired breeder rats, but there may be some ion-specific changes in the specific cognitive domains impaired.",Included

There is concern that degradation of vision as a result of space flight may compromise both mission goals and long-term quality of life after space travel.

The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy).

499,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure. Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included

Space flight produces profound changes of neuronal activity in the mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs)] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was compared to that of ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and 1 and 14 days after landing. An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight.",Included

The response of the central nervous system to boron neutron capture irradiation, with either p-boronophenylalanine (BPA) or borocaptate sodium (BSH) as neutron capture agents, has been assessed using a rat spinal cord model. The mean latency times for the development of myelopathy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam-alone, or in combination with BPA or BSH, were 23.7 +/- 0.3, 21.8 +/- 0.4 and 19.6 +/- 0.4 weeks, respectively. The radiation-induced lesion in the spinal cord was characterised by white matter necrosis. Due to the variations in the microdistribution of different neutron capture agents in body tissues, it was considered inappropriate to define the biological effectiveness of the high LET radiation, resulting from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,alpha)<sup>7</sup>Li neutron capture reaction, relative to photon radiation, using the term 'relative biological effectiveness' (RBE). The term 'compound biological effectiveness' (CBE) factor was used as an alternative. ED<inf>50</inf> values for the various irradiation modalities were calculated from probit fitted dose effect curves. Expressed as total physical absorbed doses these values were 13.6 +/- 0.4, 30.3 +/- 2.7 and 13.8 +/- 0.5 Gy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam alone, or the thermal neutron beam in combination with BSH or BPA, respectively. The RBE of the thermal neutron beam was 1.4 +/- 0.04. The microdistribution of the two neutron capture agents played a crucial role in the determination of the overall biological effect, after thermal neutron activation. BSH, which is excluded from the CNS parenchyma by the blood brain barrier, had a low CBE factor value of 0.46 +/- 0.5. BPA, on the other hand, which crosses the blood brain barrier and distributes in the CNS parenchyma, had a higher CBE factor value of 1.33 +/- 0.16.",Included

548,"Localization of glutathione and induction of glutathione synthesis-related proteins in mouse brain by low doses of gamma-rays. First, we determined the cerebral localization of reduced glutathione (GSH) in normal mice by means of autoradiography using 99mTc-meso-hexamethyl propylene oxime. A highly specific localization of GSH in the cerebellum and hippocampus was observed. Secondly, we measured the elevation of GSH level in the brain after low-dose gamma-irradiation. The cerebral GSH levels increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reaching a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, then remaining significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated control until 12 h and returning to the control level by 24 h. Thirdly, we examined the induction of the activities and the mRNAs of proteins involved in the synthesis and regeneration of GSH in the brain of mice subjected to low-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was significantly increased at 0.5 h, and remained high until 2 h post-irradiation (50 cGy). The level was transiently lowered to the non-irradiated control level at 3 h and slightly increased again after 6 h post-irradiation. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly increased 3 h after irradiation, and remained high up to 24 h post-irradiation. As for glutathione reductase, the mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h, and peaked strongly at 2 h, while the enzyme activity was significantly increased at 6 h after irradiation, and continued to increase up to 24 h. The level of mRNA for thioredoxin, which contributes to GSH biosynthesis by supplying cysteine to the de novo pathway, peaked between 0.5 h and 2 h post-irradiation, and rapidly declined thereafter. The content of thioredoxin showed a transient decrease immediately after irradiation, but was then remarkably elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 h, and thereafter declining sharply. These results indicate that the increase in endogenous GSH in mouse brain soon after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation is a consequence of the induction of GSH synthesis-related proteins and occurs via both the de novo synthesis and the regeneration pathways.",Included
554,"The effect of a single whole-body irradiation with a lethal dose on catecholamine levels in the pineal glands of rats. Male Wistar rats adapted to light-dark cycle (LD) 12:12 h were exposed in the darkness to a lethal single dose of 14.35 Gy gamma-rays on the whole body. Irradiation, sham-irradiation and decapitation 30, 60, 120 min after the exposure, were performed between 2000 h and 0100 h in the darkness. The changes in the concentrations of catecholamines (CA) were determined by the radioenzymatic method in the pineal gland of rats. Results were evaluated in comparison with those of the sham-irradiated (30, 60, 120 min) control groups of rats. From the results it follows that the concentration of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the rat pineal gland significantly decreased 30 and 120 minutes after irradiation (p < 0.01). At min 60 of the postirradiation period it was possible to observe a tendency to recovery of the levels of DA and NE to control values.

PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with small cell bladder cancer at our institution, including those who received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for the prevention of intracranial recurrence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with small cell bladder cancer treated at a single institution between January 1990 and August 2015 were identified and analyzed retrospectively for demographics, tumor stage, treatment, and overall survival.RESULTS: Of 44 patients diagnosed with small cell bladder cancer, 11 (25%) had metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Treatment included systemic chemotherapy (70%), radical surgery (59%), and local radiation (39%). Six patients (14%) received PCI. Median overall survival was 10 months (IQR 4 - 41). Patients with extensive disease had worse overall survival than those with organ confined disease (8 months vs. 36 months, respectively, p = 0.04).

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the hormones produced in pituitary gland tumours (TM) following fractionated external irradiation in rats. The TM arose in the course of studies on other questions of radiation effects.METHODS: The left neck and skull base of sixty female Wistar rats, 3 to 4 months of age at the beginning of the external irradiation, were subjected to roentgen rays exposure, fractionated to 2 Grays daily, either up to 20, 40 or 60 Gy. The midline of the neck and skull was always inside the radiation field. The animals were sacrificed either 6 months or 12 months after completion of the randomly assigned irradiation protocol. Five non-irradiated rats served as controls.RESULTS: No TM developed in the non-irradiated animals. Out of 60 irradiated rats 9 developed a pituitary TM (15%). In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas. In this series the TM were predominantly incidental findings at necropsies after pretermed follow-up intervals with a variety of hormone-producing cells. On the other hand, four of nine TM were null adenomas. Necropsies of the brain should be carried out routinely in irradiation studies of the skull.",Included

Objectives: We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on patients with surgically resected small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients and Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2009, the records of completely resected patients who were diagnosed with SCLC and definitive pTNM stage on the basis of histological proof were reviewed. According to the therapy modality, patients were allocated to PCI group and non-PCI group. Result(s): A total of 193 patients were finally included, 67 patients in PCI group and 126 in non-PCI group. The OS rates at 2-year and 5-year in PCI group were 92.5%, and 54.9%, respectively, and those of non-PCI were 63.2% and 47.8%, respectively (. p=. 0.005).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque.

The incidence for hemorrhage in non-obliterated arteriovenous malformations (AVM) during the first two years following Gamma Knife (GK) surgery was compared to the calculated incidence in untreated patients. There was a decrease in the incidence of hemorrhage as compared to the natural course. This difference was statistically significant. The actual number of hemorrhages during the first two years was 49 in a series of 1604 patients. Additionally, 41 hemorrhages occurred beyond the two years following treatment over the entire follow up time span of up to 24 years. For the first two years the calculated incidence was roughly two times higher than the observed incidence. This impact on the natural history was detectable already within six months after the treatment for the malformations totally covered with at least 25 Gy. The relation between a high minimum and a high average dose on the one hand and a lower risk for hemorrhage on the other hand was statistically significant. Low treatment doses and high age correlated to a higher risk. Neither hemorrhage prior to treatment nor time interval between presenting hemorrhage and treatment seemed to influence the risk for post treatment hemorrhage. The risk for permanent neurological deficit or death due to AVM rupture during the latency period between the time of treatment and total nidus obliteration was less than 0.5% for small AVM and 2-4% for large ones during the first two years.

Upregulation of p21 and p19ARF was confirmed using real-time PCR, which also demonstrated increased CDKN2A/p16INKa expression after irradiation. No altered regulation of another 17 senescence-associated genes was observed after irradiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased nuclear expression of p16INK4A, p19ARF, p53, p21, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and interleukin-6 (IL6) in granule cells of dentate gyrus after irradiation. Increased p16 nuclear immunoreactivity was further observed in type -1 cells, the putative neural stem cells. gamma-phosphorylated-histone-2A nuclear foci were also seen in dentate gyrus 9 weeks postirradiation. In nonirradiated mice knockout of the TRP53 or p21 gene, there was increased p16INK4A, p19ARF, and IL6, but not pp38 in dentate gyrus. We conclude that irradiation induces transcript and protein expression profile alterations in mouse dentate gyrus consistent with the senescence phenotype.

INTRODUCTION: Surgical resection of high-grade brainstem gliomas is challenging and treatment mostly involves radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we utilized registry data to determine prognostic features and impact of chemotherapy and radiation on overall survival.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for adult cases with histologically confirmed high-grade brainstem glioma. Covariates including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and treatment parameters were captured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify predictors of survival.RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were analyzed. Most patients (66.6%) underwent postoperative radiation with chemotherapy, 9.2% underwent radiation alone, while the remaining had no postoperative treatment (24.2%). Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, postoperative chemotherapy with radiation was associated with significant survival benefit compared to radiation alone for grade IV (HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76, p = 0.003), but not for grade III tumors (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.58, p = 0.65).CONCLUSION: Analysis from a national registry illustrated the effectiveness of radiation with chemotherapy for adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas, particularly grade IV.

PURPOSE: To define radiographic dose-response relationships for proton radiosurgery using a rat brain model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A group of 23 rats was treated with Bragg peak proton beam irradiation involving the right hippocampus. Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction technique. One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue.",Included

Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included

Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus.

For microscopic examination, the mice were killed at regular postirradiation intervals between 15 and 20, 31 and 40, 41 and 50, 51 and 60, 61 and 70, 71 and 80, 81 and 90, 139 and 177 weeks. The brains were removed immediately thereafter, fixed in Bouin's solution, and embedded in paraffin. A histological examination was performed by a morphometric estimation of vascular lesions, in which the degree of the damage to the arterial system was scored in whole serial brain sections. Necrosis (encephalomalacia), atrophy, cell infiltration, and telangiectatic vascular change of the brain, caused as a result of the fibrinoid necrosis of the large arteries, were observed. Dose-dependent incidence of the fibrinoid necrosis increased between 41 and 87 weeks after irradiation. Mean score of fibrinoid necrosis increased dose dependently approximately 60 weeks after irradiation. It is suggested that scores of large vessel damage do relate to dose at 41 to 87 weeks, and can be used to quantify the vessel injury, and that fibrinoid necrosis of the large vessels may relate to the incidence of radionecrosis.",Included

The authors examined the influence of x-ray irradiation on phosphodiesterase system in the brain of rats and the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibitors (caffeine, theophyline, thyopental) and activators (imidozol). The animals (Wistar with weights of 150--200 gm/were irradiated singly with a dose of 737 r. Phosphodiesterase activity (PD) was determined by the method of Filburn and Carn (1972) at two substrate concentrations (1 and 100 microM). X-ray irradiation did not change PD with high Km, while the enzyme with low Km was reduced significantly and transitionaly. Caffeine, theophyline and thyopental inhibited more PD with low Km in the irradiated rats in comparison with the control nonirradiated rats. The activating effect of imidazol on PD with low Km was more marked in irradiated rats. These data could be interpreted in the light of the molecular mechanisms, determining the altered action of some drugs after x-ray irradiation.",Included

DNA strand breaks that occur after irradiation activate the repair enzyme adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase, which consumes NAD as a substrate and causes depletion first of neuronal NAD and then of the ATP pool. This is considered to be the crucial link in the mechanism underlying the cerebral radiation syndrome (CRS). In this study, two ways to correct the CRS metabolically were examined: (a) prevention of depletion of NAD after irradiation by administration of the enzyme inhibitor nicotinamide and (b) shunting the NAD-dependent oxidative phosphorylation pathway of ATP resynthesis by administration of a substrate of NAD-independent oxidation, succinate. Cerebral lesions induced by radiation were modeled by irradiation of rats or rat brain homogenates with 150 Gy of X rays. The manifestations of CRS in rats (excitement, convulsions, etc.) closely resembled those seen after acute hypoxia. In brain homogenates, pyruvate tetrazolium-reductase activity decreased after irradiation and could be corrected by addition of NAD after irradiation. Succinate tetrazolium-reductase activity was not affected by irradiation. Oxygen consumption by brain homogenates after irradiation in vitro and in situ decreased, as did oxygen consumption by rats in vivo after cranio-caudal irradiation. Administration of nicotinamide or succinate prevented both the postirradiation decrease in respiration (in both rats in vivo and brain homogenates in vitro) and the development of cerebral radiation syndrome. These results help to clarify the mechanisms underlying CRS and its metabolic correction.",Included
834,"Cancer incidence after localized therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Second cancers may occur in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers.",Included

Late reaction of normal tissue is still a limiting factor in radiotherapy and radiosurgery of patients with brain tumors. Few quantitative data in terms of dose-response curves are available. In the present study, 99 animals were irradiated stereotactically at the right frontal lobe using a linear accelerator and single doses between 26 and 50 Gy. The diameter of the spherical dose distribution was 4.7 mm (80% isodose). Dose-response curves for late changes in the normal brain at 20 months were measured using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The dependence of the dose-response curves on the follow-up time and the definition of the biological end point were determined. Tolerance doses were calculated at several effect probability levels and times after irradiation. The MRI changes were found to be dependent on dose and progressive in time. At 20 months, the tolerance doses at a 50% effect probability level were 39.6 +/- 1.0 Gy and 42.4 +/- 1.4 Gy for changes in T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. These dose-response curves can be used for further quantitative investigations on the influence of various treatment parameters, such as the application of charged particles, radiopharmaceuticals or the variation of tissue oxygenation.",Included

Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",Included

The purpose of this work was the understanding of microbeam radiation therapy at the ESRF in order to find the best compromise between curing of tumors and sparing of normal tissues, to obtain a better understanding of survival curves and to report its efficiency. This method uses synchrotron-generated x-ray microbeams. Rats were implanted with 9L gliosarcomas and the tumors were diagnosed by MRI. They were irradiated 14 days after implantation by arrays of 25 microm wide microbeams in unidirectional mode, with a skin entrance dose of 625 Gy. The effect of using 200 or 100 microm center-to-center spacing between the microbeams was compared. The median survival time (post-implantation) was 40 and 67 days at 200 and 100 microm spacing, respectively. However, 72% of rats irradiated at 100 microm spacing showed abnormal clinical signs and weight patterns, whereas only 12% of rats were affected at 200 microm spacing. In parallel, histological lesions of the normal brain were found in the 100 microm series only. Although the increase in lifespan was equal to 273% and 102% for the 100 and 200 microm series, respectively, the 200 microm spacing protocol provides a better sparing of healthy tissue and may prove useful in combination with other radiation modalities or additional drugs.",Included

Sodium borocaptate (BSH) and boronophenylalanine (BPA) are two drugs that have been used clinically for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) of brain tumors. We previously have reported that hyperosmotic mannitol-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-D), followed by intracarotid (i.c.) administration of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, significantly enhanced tumor boron delivery and the efficacy of BNCT in F98 glioma bearing rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine the short-term neuropathologic consequences of this treatment and the long-term effects on motor and cognitive function, as well as the neuropathologic sequelae 1 year following neutron capture irradiation. BBB-D was carried out in non-tumor bearing Fischer rats by infusing a 25% solution of mannitol i.c. followed by i.c. injection of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, immediately thereafter. Animals were euthanized 2 days after compound administration, and their brains were processed for neuropathologic examination, which revealed sporadic, mild, focal neuronal degeneration, hemorrhage, and necrosis. To assess the long-term effects of such treatment followed by neutron capture irradiation, non-tumor bearing rats were subjected to BBB-D after which they were injected i.c. with BPA (25 mg B/kg body weight (b.w)) or BSH (30 mg B/kg b.w.) either individually or in combination (BPA 12.5 mg and BSH 14 mg B/kg b.w.). Two and a half hours later they were irradiated at the Medical Research Reactor, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, with the same physical radiation doses (5.79, 8.10 or 10.06 Gy), delivered to the brain, as those that previously had been used for our therapy experiments. The animals tolerated this procedure well, after which they were returned to Columbus, Ohio where their clinical status was monitored weekly. After 1 year, motor function was assessed using a sensitive and reliable locomotor rating scale for open field testing in rats and cognitive function was evaluated by their performance in the Morris water maze, the results of which were similar to those obtained with age matched controls. After functional evaluation, the rats were euthanized, their brains were removed, and then processed for neuropathologic examination. Subtle histopathologic changes were seen in the choroid plexuses of irradiated animals that had received BPA, BSH or saline. Radiation related ocular changes consisting of keratitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and cataract formation were seen with similar frequency in most rats in each treatment group. Based on these observations, and the previously reported significant therapeutic gain associated with BBB-D and i.c. injection of BSH and BPA, the present observations establish its safety in rats and suggest that further studies in large animals and humans are warranted.",Included
956,"Distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells in X-irradiated rats. An electrophysiological study. 1. The distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied with intracellular recordings in X-irradiated and normal rats. 2. In the treated rats, multiple steps in the post-synaptic potential were elicited in 57% of the Purkinje cells by graded stimulation of the climbing fibres, the response was all-or-none in character in the other cells and in all Purkinje cells recorded in normal animals. In the neurones exhibiting the former type of response, no collision was seen along the afferent fibres during interaction experiments between just-threshold juxtafastigial and maximal olivary stimulations, whereas a collision always occurred when all-or-none responses were recorded. 3. These results show that in X-irradiated rats, the majority of Purkinje cells have a multiple innervation by two to four climbing fibres, instead of the one-to-one relationship seen normally. 4. Input resistances and total electrotonic lengths of Purkinje cells were measured in normal and treated rats. Mean values for these two parameters were higher than normal in multiply innervated cells. 5. Mean time course and mean current for reversal of the post-synaptic potential elicited in Purkinje cells by stimulation of the climbing fibres were nearly the same in mono- and in multiply innervated neurones. In multiply innervated cells, time courses and currents for reversal were independent of the size of the response or varied slightly with it, suggesting that the climbing fibres involved innervated territories whose electrotonic distance from the recording site were either the same or slightly different. 6. Interactions between two all-or-none steps of the graded post-synaptic potential evoked in multiply innervated cells by juxtafastigial and olivary stimulations revealed either a very weak or a very marked shunting effect between synapses of the two climbing fibres involved. 7. These results indicate that the over-all distribution of climbing fibre synapses on multiply innervated Purkinje cells is not grossly abnormal and that two fibres contacting a given cell can be either intermingled on the same dendrites, or segregated on distinct dendritic branches. 8. In general, the present study does not suggest the existence of a strong competition among climbing fibres innervating each Purkinje cell during development at least when granule cells are absent.",Included

983,"The source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the goldfish: a differential irradiation protocol. We have used a partial irradiation paradigm to examine the provenance of cells that participate in Wallerian cellular responses in the goldfish visual system. Animals which received 50 Gy whole-body gamma-irradiation showed virtually complete inhibition of the proliferative burst usually seen after optic nerve section. These animals did, however, show a robust hyperplastic response in the optic tract that we believe represents the migration of nearby microglial cells into the affected tract. When only the postcephalic body was irradiated, proliferating cells in the major hematopoietic organs of the fish, the kidney and pronephros, were substantially inhibited. Despite this, the Wallerian cellular response in the visual paths was essentially normal. Thus, there is no obligate requirement for peripheral proliferative cells to participate in central Wallerian degeneration in the fish. However, when only the head was irradiated, and the hematopoietic organs were spared, there was a proliferative response in the visual system. We believe this represents the invasion of the visual pathways by peripheral blood cells through the optic nerve lesion and blood vessels in the nerve itself. This invasion, however, is not sufficient to generate substantial hyperplasia. In summary, although we find evidence for a small contribution by exogenous cells, the major source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the fish is the endogenous microglia. Our data underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanisms by which microglial cells are activated and the role that they play in regeneration.",Included

The authors carried out studies on 267 male rats and examined the effect of ionizing irradation (single irradation with 737 roentgens) on the duration of swimming and on the alteration of this effect by psychic stimulators caffeine and methylphenidate, administered in overthreshold doses (30 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for caffeine and 5 and 10 mg/kg of body weight for methylphenidate). On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced.

Purpose/Objective(s): In our previous study, we have found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis shortly after radiation. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of minocycline on neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis. Purpose/Objective(s): The immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cell line was used. The protective effect of minocycline on X-irradiated HT22 cells was demonstrated using clonogenic assay and apoptosis analysis. The underlying mechanisms were explored by using methods such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, shRNA knockdown, Western blot et al. Result(s): We found that minocycline protected HT22 hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced cell death, manifest as increased clonogenic cell survival and decreased apoptosis in irradiated cells. This protective effect of minocycline might involve cell cycle perturbation after radiation, but not DNA damage and repair. Further investigation showed that X-irradiation activated AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy, and minocycline significantly enhanced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of minocycline might not be involved in the enhancing effect of minocycline on radiation-induced autophagy, but it might at least partially contribute to the inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced apoptosis. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis mainly through targeting radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

PURPOSE: To investigate homology and stress response of p53 (a 53 kDa tumor suppressor protein) orthologue in Sf9 Lepidopteran insect cell line that exhibits very high radioresistance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, degenerate RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, flow cytometry and immuno-fluorescence microscopy were used for characterizing structural and functional features of Sfp53 (Spodoptera frugiperda p53) in gamma-irradiated or etoposide-treated Sf9 insect and BMG-1 (brain malignant glioma) human cells. Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization.

The covalent addition of nitric oxide (NO<sup>*</sup>) onto cysteine thiols, or S-nitrosylation, modulates the activity of key signaling proteins. The dysregulation of normal S-nitrosylation contributes to degenerative conditions and to cancer. To gain insight into the biochemical changes induced by low-dose ionizing radiation, we determined global S-nitrosylation by the ""biotin switch"" assay coupled with mass spectrometry analyses in organs of C57BL/6J mice exposed to acute 0.1 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma-rays. The dose of radiation was delivered to the whole body in the presence or absence of iopamidol, an iodinated contrast agent used during radiological examinations. To investigate whether similar or distinct nitrosylation patterns are induced following high-dose irradiation, mice were exposed in parallel to acute 4 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma rays. Analysis of modulated S-nitrosothiols (SNO-proteins) in freshly-harvested organs of animals sacrificed 13 days after irradiation revealed radiation dose- and contrast agent-dependent changes. The major results were as follows: (i) iopamidol alone had significant effects on S-nitrosylation in brain, lung and liver; (ii) relative to the control, exposure to 0.1 Gy without iopamidol resulted in statistically-significant SNO changes in proteins that differ in molecular weight in liver, lung, brain and blood plasma; (iii) iopamidol enhanced the decrease in S-nitrosylation induced by 0.1 Gy in brain; (iv) whereas a decrease in S-nitrosylation occurred at 0.1 Gy for proteins of ~50 kDa in brain and for proteins of ~37 kDa in liver, an increase was detected at 4 Gy in both organs; (v) mass spectrometry analyses of nitrosylated proteins in brain revealed differential modulation of SNO proteins (e.g., sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1; beta tubulins; ADP-ribosylation factor 5) by low- and high-dose irradiation; and (vi) ingenuity pathway analysis identified major signaling networks to be modulated, in particular the neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway was differentially modulated by low- and high-dose gamma-irradiation.",Included

INTRODUCTION: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors the main dose-limiting tissue is found in the kidneys because of tubular reabsorption and retention of radioactivity. The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE.",Included
1034,"Contrasting the effects of proton irradiation on dendritic complexity of subiculum neurons in wild type and MCAT mice. Growing evidence suggests that radiation-induced oxidative stress directly affects a wide range of biological changes with an overall negative impact on CNS function. In the past we have demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing human catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) exhibit a range of neuroprotective phenotypes following irradiation that include improved neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and cognition. To determine the extent of the neuroprotective phenotype afforded by MCAT expression in different hippocampal regions, we analyzed subiculum neurons for changes in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity after exposure to low dose (0.5 Gy) 150 MeV proton irradiation. One month following irradiation of WT and MCAT mice, a range of morphometric parameters were quantified along Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons. Compared with WT mice, subiculum neurons from MCAT mice exhibited increased trends (albeit not statistically significant) toward increased dendritic complexity in both control and irradiated cohorts. However, Sholl analysis of MCAT mice revealed significantly increased arborization of the distal dendritic tree, indicating a protective effect on secondary and tertiary branching. Interestingly, radiation-induced increases in postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) puncta were not as pronounced in MCAT compared with WT mice, and were significantly lower after the 0.5 Gy dose. As past data has linked radiation exposure to reduced dendritic complexity, elevated PSD-95 and impaired cognition, reductions in mitochondrial oxidative stress have proven useful in ameliorating many of these radiation-induced sequelae. Data presented here shows similar trends, and again points to the potential benefits of reducing oxidative stress in the brain to attenuate radiation injury. Environ. Mol.

Using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy combined with synchrotron microbeam radiation, we investigated, during one year after irradiation, the effects of unilateral radio-ablation of the right Cd on the behavior of Yucatan minipigs. The right Cd was irradiated to a minimal dose of 35.5 Gy delivered in three fractions. MRI-based morphological brain integrity and behavioral functions, i.e. locomotion, motivation/hedonism were assessed. We detected a progressive radio-necrosis leading to a quasi-total ablation one year after irradiation, with an additional alteration of surrounding areas. Transitory changes in the motivation/hedonism were firstly detected, then on locomotion, suggesting the influence of different compensatory mechanisms depending on the functions related to Cd and possibly some surrounding areas. We concluded that early behavioral changes related to eating functions are relevant markers for the early detection of ongoing lesions occurring in Cd-related neurological disorders.",Included
1056,"Does the robotic platform reduce the morbidity associated with combined radical surgery and adjuvant radiation for early cervical cancer?. Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33). There was no difference in grade 2/3 LT complications in patients receiving adjuvant XRT between the groups (27.5% vs 27.9%, P =.97). However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups.",Included

Exposure of rats to 1-15 Gy gamma radiation (<sup>60</sup>Co) induced hyperthermia, whereas 20-200 Gy induced hypothermia. Exposure either to the head or the whole body to 10 Gy induced hyperthermia, while body-only exposure produced hypothermia. This observation indicates that radiation-induced fever is a result of a direct effect on the brain. The hyperthermia due to 10 Gy was significantly attenuated by the pre- or post-treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Hyperthermia was also altered by the central administration of a mu-receptor antagonist naloxone but only at low doses of radiation. These findings suggest that radiation-induced hyperthermia may be mediated through the synthesis and release of prostaglandins in the brain and to a lesser extent to the release of endogenous opioid peptides. The release of histamine acting on H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors may be involved in radiation-induced hypothermia, since both the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, mepyramine, and H<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist, cimetidine, antagonized the hypothermia. The results of these studies suggest that the release of neurohumoral substances induced by exposure to ionizing radiation is dose dependent and has different consequences on physiological processes such as the regulation of body temperature. Furthermore, the antagonism of radiation-induced hyperthermia by indomethacin may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of fever resulting from accidental irradiations.",Included

Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the early neurovascular alterations of the retina in radiation encephalopathy (RE) patients with normal-ranged visual acuity after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): Fifty-five RE patients and 54 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) of the included eye should not be more than 0. The vessel density and thickness of different locations in the retina were acquired automatically using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The data were then compared between the RE patients and the controls. The location included the whole retina, the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)/the ganglion cell complex (GCC), the deep vascular plexus (DVP), and the choroid in the macular area, as well as the inside disc and peripapillary area in the optic nerve head (ONH). The risk factors in OCTA retinal impairments were analyzed using a backward multiple linear regression. The relationships between mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in the visual field (VF) and the OCTA parameters were also analyzed in RE patients. Result(s): The vessel density of the GCC was significantly reduced in RE patients compared with controls (p = 0.018), and the reductions were mainly shown in the parafoveal (p = 0.049) and perifoveal fields (p = 0.006). The thickness of the GCC was correspondingly reduced (whole image GCC mean thickness: p = 0.044; parafoveal thickness: p = 0.038; perifoveal thickness: p = 0.038). In addition, the sub-foveal choroidal thickness (p = 0.039) was also reduced in RE patients. The vessel density of the GCC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.643) and DVP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.777) had a significant positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and had a significant negative correlation with age (GCC: HDL-C, beta = 29.89, p = 0.005; ApoA1, beta = 78.92, p = 0.002; age, beta = -0.886, p = 0.001; DVP: HDL-C, beta = 40.09, p = 0.003; ApoA1, beta = 62.65, p = 0.013; age, beta = -1.31, p = 0.001). The vessel density of the GCC also had a significant negative correlation with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (beta = -32.18, p = 0.006). In the VF, MD had a significant positive correlation with the vessel density inside disc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.241, beta = 0.304, p = 0.045), whereas PSD showed a significant negative correlation with the vessel density inside disc and the average GCC thickness, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437; vessel density inside disc, beta = -0.358, p = 0.004; average GCC thickness, beta = -0.510, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): With the aid of OCTA, we found that neurovascular alterations of the retina may exist in RE patients with normal-ranged visual acuity. Herein, we suggest the implementation of OCTA to assist ophthalmologists in the early detection and consistent monitoring of radiation-related eye diseases to avoid delayed diagnosis. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Zhan, Xiao and Lan.",Included

1115,"The contribution of DNA and chromosome repair deficiencies to the radiosensitivity of ataxia-telangiectasia. Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype.",Included
1118,"Alteration of Interneuron Immunoreactivity and Autophagic Activity in Rat Hippocampus after Single High-Dose Whole-Brain Irradiation. The effects of high dose gamma radiation on brain tissue are poorly understood, with both limited and major changes reported. The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation.",Included

The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included

Plots of 'degeneration scores' (counts of profiles in 29 areas) vs. dose for the proton and electron irradiations displayed a linear dose response for protons in the range of 2-8 Gy. In the 20-100 Gy range, for both electrons and protons the points were distributed in a broad band suggesting a saturation curve.

The first group was the control group (sham-exposed group), the second group received only melatonin, the third group was irradiated and the fourth group received both melatonin and irradiation. Plasma samples of rats were collected for measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the levels of NO. 24 h after the interventions, tissue samples were obtained from the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex for the light microscopic investigations. These tissues were mostly affected by radiation. The results indicated that the application of radiation significantly enhanced the levels of plasma SOD and NO.

Primary goals of treatment include normalization of hormonal level and improving visual or neurological symptoms. Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma.

This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters. Thus, radioresistant DNA synthesis in chromosomal instability syndromes may be explained by some defect in DNA replication in unirradiated cells analogous to that in irradiated normal cells.",Included

In this study, the effect of Corilagin on RIBI was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were explored. Spatial learning and memory ability of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy were used to assess the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, were measured by using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activation of microglial cells and expression of TNF-alpha were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and IkappaBalpha, and the translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus were detected by using Western blotting. Morris water maze test showed that Corilagin ameliorated the neurocognitive deficits in RIBI mice. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy exhibited that Corilagin partially protected the BBB integrity from cranial irradiation-caused damage; immunofluorescence staining showed that Corilagin could inhibit microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression. Real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that Corilagin downregulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and inhibited the irradiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB pathways by upregulating p-STAT3 expression. In conclusion, Corilagin could attenuate RIBI through inhibiting microglial activation and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines. Corilagin might inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB pathway in a STAT3-associated manner, thereby downregulating the inflammatory cytokine expressions.",Included

Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner. These persistent changes in neuronal function are likely to be a consequence of the actions of ionizing radiation on the physiological processes that influence the neuronal environment.",Included

Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

At 24 hours there was an increase in the neural transcription factors Mash1 and Pax6 expression, and a disruption of the basal lamina and increase in glandular cell marker expression at 1 week post-irradiation. Coincident with these changes was an impairment of the olfactory function in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significant changes in basal cell proliferation as well as morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium following X-ray irradiation. There is involvement of the basal lamina as well as a clear role for glandular and sustentacular cells.",Included

1250,"Effects of Amifostine Pre-treatment on MIRNA, LNCRNA, and MRNA Profiles in the Hypothalamus of Mice Exposed to 60Co Gamma Radiation. There is increasing evidence that the expression of non-coding RNA and mRNA (messenger RNA) is significantly altered following high-dose ionizing radiation (IR), and their expression may play a critical role in cellular responses to IR. However, the role of non-coding RNA and mRNA in radiation protection, especially in the nervous system, remains unknown. In this study, microarray profiles were used to determine microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of mice that were pretreated with amifostine and subsequently exposed to high-dose IR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. We found that fewer miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were induced by amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice, which exhibited antagonistic effects compared to IR, indicating that amifostine attenuated the IR-induced effects on RNA profiles. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed changes in a variety of signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses during radioprotection following amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice. Taken together, our study revealed that amifostine treatment altered or attenuated miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of exposed mice. These data provide a resource to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying amifostine-mediated radioprotection in the hypothalamus.",Included

Research from several sources indicates that young (3 mo) rats exposed to heavy particle irradiation (56Fe irradiation) produces changes in motor behavior as well as alterations in neuronal transmission similar to those seen in aged (22-24 mo) rats. These changes are specific to neuronal systems that are affected by aging. Since 56Fe particles make up approximately 1-2% of cosmic rays, these findings suggest that the neuronal effects of heavy particle irradiation on long-term space flights may be significant, and may even supercede subsequent mutagenic effects in their mission capabilities. It is suggested that among other methods, it may be possible to utilize nutritional modification procedures to offset the putative deleterious effects of these particles in space.",Included
1277,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy. Due to an increasing concern about radiation-induced cognitive deficits for brain tumor patients receiving radiation therapy, developing and evaluating countermeasures has become inevitable. Our previous study has found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the present study, we report an unknown mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of minocycline. We demonstrated that minocycline prevented primary neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis and promoted radiation-induced autophagy in vitro. Moreover, using an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22 cells, we found that the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated HT22 cells was not related to DNA damage repair since minocycline did not facilitate DNA DSB repair in irradiated HT22 cells. Further investigation showed that minocycline significantly enhanced X-irradiation-induced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, thus resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, although the antioxidant potential of minocycline might contribute to its apoptosis-inhibitory effect, it was not involved in its enhancive effect on radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy. Taken together, we have revealed a novel mechanism for the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated neurons, e.g. minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis via enhancing radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included
1282,"Transmission of signals between irradiated and non-irradiated organisms: Mechanisms and significance. Inter-animal signaling from irradiated to non-irradiated organisms has been demonstrated for whole body irradiated mice and also for fish. Endpoints studied include clastogenic damage, and reproductive cell death. For fish, proteomic data has also been produced showing the induction of a protective proteome in both medaka and rainbow trout. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",Included

The antimutagenic effects of the radiation protective agent, S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721), were studied against fission-spectrum-neutron- and 60Co-gamma-ray-induced mutagenesis in mice. Mutagenesis at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus was measured 56 days following whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons (single doses, 50-150 cGy) or 60Co photons (single doses, 250-750 cGy). Splenic T lymphocytes from B6CF1 mice were grown in round-bottomed 96-microwell culture plates with or without the selective agent 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The mutant frequency, as a result of exposure to neutrons or 60Co photons, increased 100-fold with dose. Doses of 150 cGy neutrons and 750 cGy 60Co photons were equally mutagenic. When animals were injected with WR-2721 at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight, i.p., 30 min before whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons or 60Co photons, mutant frequencies were significantly reduced at all radiation doses (i.e. protection factors of 1.4 and 2.4, respectively). Thus, the aminothiols are effective antimutagens. A novel clinical application of these compounds could be in their use to protect against radiation- and/or chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage to normal cells.",Included

Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months. Human brain tumor slices remained vital for at least 21 days. Slices were irradiated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt/Main at doses up to 40 Gy. Heavy ion irradiations were performed at GSI (Darmstadt) with different ions, energies, and doses.

Mitochondria are linked with various radiation responses, including mitophagy, genomic instability, apoptosis, and the bystander effect. Mitochondria play an important role in preserving cellular homeostasis during stress responses, and dysfunction in mitochondrial contributes to aging, carcinogenesis and neurologic diseases. In this study, we have investigated the mitochondrial degeneration and autophagy in the hippocampal region of brains from mice administered with BBT-059, a long-acting interleukin-11 analog, or its formulation buffer 24 h prior to irradiation at different radiation doses collected at 6 and 12 months post-irradiation. The results demonstrated a higher number of degenerating mitochondria in 12 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 6 months and 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 12 months as compared to the age-matched naive (non-irradiated control animals). Apg5l, Lc3b and Sqstm1 markers were used to analyze the autophagy in the brain, however only the Sqstm1 marker exhibited significantly reduced expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to naive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of Bcl2 also demonstrated a decrease in expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to other groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure.",Included

Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results. When treatment with either modality alone is not reasonable, tumors can be managed effectively with combined micro- and radiosurgery treatment.",Included

Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT <inf>non-RE</inf> (n = 21) and post-RT <inf>REproved</inf><inf>infollow-up</inf> (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Kang, Zeng, Li, Gao, Liu, Shi and Liao.",Included

1423,"Effect of low dose radiation on cognition, cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status. Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behaviour and cognitive functions. These changes depend largely on the dose received and time. While high radiation doses can cause severe tissue destruction, lower doses can induce cognitive impairments without signs of overt tissue damage. Radiation-induced cognitive impairments are reported to occur in up to 50-90% of adult brain tumour patients who survive more than 6 months post-irradiation. This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days. And a blood Serotonin and cortisol analysis was carried out using ELISA kits. Results obtained were analysed using one-way ANOVA. There was a significant decline in exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in open field test. We observed a significant decline in spontaneous Percent Alternation indicating the short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. 1 and 3 Gy irradiated mice exhibited increased anxiety in EPM. The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were statistically not significant. The changes to cortisol level were in a dose dependent manner and serotonin levels decreased with dose. Total antioxidant levels also showed the decreasing trend with respect to radiation doses, this pattern is similar to the pattern of cognitive decline shown in behaviour analysis suggesting that the antioxidant status maybe co-related to the radiation induced cognitive decline.

PURPOSE: To investigate how treatment-related and non-treatment-related factors impact urethral pain among long-term prostate cancer survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden from 1993 to 2006 were approached with a study-specific postal questionnaire addressing symptoms after treatment, including urethral burning pain during urination (n=985). The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included

Environmental epigenetics is the study of how exposures interact with the epigenome to cause stable epigenetic change, most notably changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here we asked whether the response of the mouse epigenome to ionizing radiation is specific or non-specific. We used meDIP-seq to examine radiation-induced changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) throughout the genome. To examine tissue specificity, we compared the methylomes of heart and brain tissue 22 weeks after exposure to protons. We found 5mC and 5hmC changes that mapped to genes with cardiovascular functions in the heart and with neuronal functions in the brain. We also compared two forms of ionizing radiation, the sparsely ionizing protons and densely ionizing 56Fe ions. Both are components of galactic cosmic radiation, which is a concern for astronauts flying deep space missions. Specifically, we asked whether protons and 56Fe ions would produce similar DNA methylation changes in the brain at 4 weeks post exposure, and found significant overlap for both 5mC and 5hmC changes. Interestingly, gene expression changes in the brain at 4 weeks were linked to changes in 5hmC at promoter regions, but not 5mC, and these linked changes mapped to neuronal ontology pathways. Further, a novel form of 5hmC change along gene bodies was observed and mapped mostly to postsynaptic pathways. Finally, the extent of 56Fe ion-induced behavioral change correlated inversely with DNA methylation change suggesting that the epigenomic response to radiation was part of the repair process to mitigate its toxic effects.",Included

Future space missions will involve long-term travel beyond the magnetic field of the Earth, where astronauts will be exposed to radiation hazards such as those that arise from galactic cosmic rays.

Research by our group has shown that exposure to HZE particles, primarily 600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n 56Fe, can produce significant alterations in brain neurochemistry and behavior. However, given that protons can make up a significant portion of the radiation spectrum, it is important to study their effects on neural functioning and on related performance. Therefore, these studies examined the effects of exposure to proton irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints, including dopaminergic functioning, amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion learning, and spatial learning and memory as measured by the Morris water maze. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a dose of 0, 1.5, 3.0 or 4.0 Gy of 250 MeV protons at Loma Linda University and were tested in the different behavioral tests at various times following exposure. Results showed that there was no effect of proton irradiation at any dose on any of the endpoints measured. Therefore, there is a contrast between the insignificant effects of high dose proton exposure and the dramatic effectiveness of low dose (<0.1 Gy) exposures to 56Fe particles on both neurochemical and behavioral endpoints.",Included

PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included

In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades.

In mice tested for cued freezing, there was no correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades.

In addition, in mice irradiated with 1Gy cued freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive neurons in the free blade.

Annual effective doses for flight crew have been estimated to be in the order of 2-5 mSv and can attain 75 mSv at career end. Epidemiological studies in this occupational group have been conducted over the last 15-20 years, usually with a focus on radiation-associated cancer. These studies are summarised in this note. Overall cancer risk was not elevated in most studies and subpopulations analysed, while malignant melanoma, other skin cancers and breast cancer in female aircrew have shown elevated incidence, with lesser risk elevations in terms of mortality. In some studies, including the large German cohort, brain cancer risk appears elevated. Cardiovascular mortality risks were generally very low. Dose information for pilots was usually derived from calculation procedures based on routine licence information, types of aircraft and routes/hours flown, but not on direct measurements. However, dose estimates have shown high validity when compared with measured values. No clear-cut dose-response patterns pointing to a higher risk for those with higher cumulative doses were found. Studies on other health outcomes have shown mixed results. Overall, aircrew are a highly selected group with many specific characteristics and exposures that might also influence cancers or other health outcomes. Radiation-associated health effects have not been clearly established in the studies available so far.",Included
1513,"Possible role of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and rutin in protection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in irradiated rats. PURPOSE: To investigate the possible role of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and rutin in ameliorating the biochemical changes in brain and serum induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in whole body gamma-irradiated rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats (either irradiated or non-irradiated) followed by reperfusion.RESULTS: I/R increased brain content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and depleted its glutathione (GSH) content with a compensatory elevation in cytosolic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes. It also raised brain cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and calcium (Ca(2+)) level. Furthermore, I/R provoked an inflammatory response reflected by an increment in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interlukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Moreover, induction of I/R in irradiated rats resulted in a further increase in brain oxidative stress and cytosolic LDH activity, disturbed brain Ca(2+) homeostasis and exaggerated the inflammatory reaction. During irradiation, administration of each of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and rutin to irradiated rats before induction of I/R, alleviated the brain oxidative stress. Moreover, these antioxidants caused attenuation of the rise of the cytosolic activities of GPx and GR. A lowering effect of the cytosolic LDH activity and Ca(2+) level were caused by treatment with antioxidants. Each of vitamin E and rutin revealed an anti-inflammatory action of these antioxidants, while CoQ10 had no effect on serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that supplementation with either vitamin E, CoQ10 or rutin ameliorated most of the biochemical changes induced by I/R in irradiated rat brain and serum.",Included

OBJECTIVE: The study was focused on evaluation of peculiarities of the clinical manifestations of type II diabetesmellitus (TIIDM) in the Chornobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident clean-up workers (ACUW).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ChNPP ACUW of 1986-1987 period (n = 449, males) and 158 males not exposed to ion-izing radiation (the control group, CG) were involved in the study in 2013-2018. Diagnosis of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) was established in accordance with diagnostic standards adopted inUkraine. All study subjects had no signs of CVD, and neither of endocrine disease nor of metabolic disorders beforethe accident.RESULTS: Clinical course of the TIIDM, depending on the disease severity, onset of angiopathy and polyneuropathy,prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure were surveyed and analyzed. Concomitant TIIDM was associated witha higher incidence of angina pectoris and heart failure. According to the Kaplan-Meier method of survival estimatingthe accumulation of new TIIDM cases occurred faster in the ACUW compared with individuals in the CG, however withno statistical significance in subjects aged up to 60 years old (log-rank test chi2 = 4.89, p = 0.027). Mean age of theACUW having comorbid CVD and DM was (54.6 +/- 9.7) years, whilst in the CG it was (59.9 +/- 10.7) years (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: The DM course in the ACUW was not significantly different from non-irradiated control both in sever-ity and such complications as angiopathy of retina and lower extremities, as well as manifestations of lower extrem-ity polyneuropathy. Clinical manifestations of CVD in the form of angina pectoris and heart failure were identical inthe ACUW and control group of patients having a comorbid TIIDM. The latter was a factor exacerbating the CVDcourse and leading to a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure both in the ACUW and in non-irritat-ed individuals. Accumulation of the new DM cases occurred more rapidly in ACUW vs. non-irradiated control, so theywere in average 5 years younger at the time of TIIDM manifestation than the control subjects.",Included
1523,"Resveratrol restores erectile function in irradiated rats: Role on SIRT-1 and nNOS protein expressions. INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RVT), a well-known antioxidant agent, on oxidative parameters and erectile function in a rat model of pelvic irradiation. MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

Unfortunately, it might raise the risk of ischemic stroke, with neuroinflammation being a major pathological process. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system and have been reported for playing important roles in ischemic stroke.OBJECTIVE: Here we studied how gamma-radiation would introduce astrocytes into a detrimental state for neuroinflammation and provide new theory evidence and target for the clinical management of inflammation- related neural damage after radiation-induced ischemic stroke.METHOD: HA-1800 cells were treated with gamma-radiation and then the protein and mRNA levels of Connexin (Cx)-43 were evaluated by western and q-PCR. The culture supernatant was collected and the concentrations of the inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. MiRNA complementary to Cx-43 was designed through the online tools.RESULTS: Cx-43 is upregulated in the treatment of gamma-radiation in astrocytes and gamma-radiation introduced the detrimental function of astrocytes: cell viability was reduced while the apoptotic cells were increased. Inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin 1-beta were dramatically up-regulated by the irradiation. MiR-374a rescued irradiation induced Cx-43 up-regulation of astrocytes and eliminated detrimental function triggered by gamma-radiation.CONCLUSION: Cx-43 expression level may play an important role in the inflammation-related neural damage after irradiation-induced ischemic stroke.",Included

Focussed radiosurgery may provide a means of inducing molecular changes on the luminal surface of diseased endothelium to allow targeted delivery of novel therapeutic compounds. We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included

Background: The relationship between whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) dose with intracranial tumor control and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases (BM) is largely unknown. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 595 NSCLC BM patients treated consecutively at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between 2013 to 2015. We assigned the patients into 4 dose groups of WBRT: none, < 30, 30-39, and >= 40 Gy and assessed their relationship with OS and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS). Cox models were utilized. Covariates included sex, age, KPS, BM lesions, extracranial metastasis, BM and lung tumor resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and focal radiotherapy modalities. Result(s): Patients had a mean age of 59 years and were 44% female. Their median survival time (MST) of OS and iPFS were 9.3 and 8.9 months. Patients receiving none (344/58%), < 30 (30/5%), 30-39 (93/16%), and >= 40 (128/22%) Gy of WBRT had MST of OS (iPFS) of 7.3 (6.8), 6.0 (5.4), 10.3 (11.9) and 11.9 (11.9) months, respectively. Compared to none, other WBRT groups had adjusted HRs for OS - 1.23 (p > 0.20), 0.72 (0.08), 0.61 (< 0.00) and iPFS - 1.63 (0.03), 0.71 (0.06), 0.67 (< 0.01). Compared to 30-39 Gy, WBRT dose >=40 Gy was not associated with improved OS and iPFS (all p > 0.40). Stratified analyses by 1-3 and >= 4 BM lesions and adjustment analyses by each prognostic index of RPA class, Lung-GPA and Lung-molGPA supported these relationships as well. Conclusion(s): Compared to none, WBRT doses >=30 Gy are invariably associated with improved intracranial tumor control and survival in NSCLC BM patients. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Included

BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.",Included
1586,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research.",Included

UNLABELLED: Objective - to estimate the possible effects of low dose ionizing radiation on human cognitive function in adult hood and in utero.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive tests, telomere length and expression of genes regulating telomere function were studied in Chornobyl cleanup workers who were exposed to doses under 500 mSv (n = 326) and subjects exposed in utero during the first days after the accident Prypiat town (n = 104). The neurocognitive assessment covered mem ory, attention, language, executive and visiospatial functions. In young adults after prenatal exposure a relation ship was analyzed between a cognitive function and radiation dose to foetus, brain and thyroid gland. Internal con trols were used for both groups - the group of Chornobyl cleanup workers exposed in doses less than 20 mSv and an age matched comparison group from radioactively contaminated areas for subjects exposed in utero.RESULTS: Cognitive functions in cleanup workers exposed to ionizing radiation at adulthood are characterized by symptoms of a mild cognitive impairment according to the MMSE (mean group score 25,58 +/- 2,95) and a significant ly higher level of mental disorders according to the BPRS in a dose related manner. Cleanup workers exposed to doses over 500 mSv demonstrate a significant cognitive deficit in comparison with those exposed below 500 mSv and espe cially non exposed patients. Subjects exposed in utero during the check at age of 25-27 years exhibit an excess of the disorders of autonomic nervous system (ICD 10: G90). Neurological microsymptoms as well as neurotic, stress relat ed and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) dominate. Relationship were revealed between the TERT, TERF1, TERF2 genes expression, relative telomere length (RTL),cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular pathology, radiation dose and age. Telomere length in cleanup workers is sreduced after 50 years (6.1 %). The most significant reduction in telomere length is shown after 70 years (11.7 %). Negative correlation was found between telomere length and degree of cog nitive deficit (MMSE scale) and between age and degree of cognitive deficit. The RTL is significantly decreased in groups of persons with cognitive deficit compared to a comparison group. Telomere length at the late period after low dose radiation exposure is downregulated by the high TERF2 gene expression combined with low expression of TERT gene. After exposure to doses over 250-500 mSv a cognitive deficit and dementia were associated with a substantial increase in TERT gene expression, overexpression of TERF1 and decrease in expression of TERF2 gene. A relationship was revealed between the TERF2 gene expression and CD95+ cell fraction susceptible to apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cognitive deficit in humans at a late period after radiation exposure is influ enced by dose, age at exposure and gene regulation of telomere function.",Included

1600,"Low (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle radiation lead to a persistent reduction in the spatial learning ability of rats. Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is considered to be a potential health risk in long-term space travel, and it represents a significant risk to the central nervous system (CNS). The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.

Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) codes: 430-438] was studied in a cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1982 and followed up to the end of 2008. The cohort size was increased by 19% and follow-up extended by 3 years over the previous analysis. Radiation doses were estimated using an updated dosimetry system: Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time, in an analysis of this cohort, quantitative smoking data were used. Workers of the study cohort were exposed occupationally to prolonged external gamma rays and internal alpha particles. The mean (+/-standard deviation) total dose from external gamma rays was 0.54 +/- 0.76 Gy (95% percentile 2.21 Gy) for males and 0.44 +/- 0.65 Gy (95% percentile 1.87 Gy) for females. The mean plutonium body burden in the 31% of workers monitored for internal exposure was 1.32 +/- 4.87 kBq (95% percentile 4.71 kBq) for males and 2.21 +/- 13.24 kBq (95% percentile 4.56 kBq) for females. The mean total absorbed alpha-particles dose to the liver from incorporated plutonium was 0.23 +/- 0.77 Gy (95% percentile 0.89 Gy) in males and 0.44 +/- 2.11 Gy (95% percentile 1.25 Gy) in females. After adjusting for nonradiation factors (gender, age, calendar period, employment period, facility, smoking, alcohol consumption), there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence associated with total absorbed dose from external gamma rays and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal alpha-particle radiation exposure. Excess relative risks per Gy (ERR/Gy) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.37, 0.57) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16, 0.42), respectively, based on a linear dose-response model. Adjustments for additional factors (hypertension, body mass index, duration of employment, smoking index and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal exposure during the analysis of external exposure and vice versa) had little effect on the results. The categorical analyses showed that CVD incidence was significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses and that CVD incidence was also significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-particle doses to the liver from incorporated plutonium greater than 0.01 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. The results of the categorical analyses of CVD incidence were in good agreement with a linear dose response for external gamma-ray doses but for internal alpha-particle doses the picture was less clear. For the first time an excess risk of CVD mortality was seen in workers whose livers were exposed to internal alpha-particle doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those workers who were exposed to doses of less than 0.01 Gy. A significant increasing trend for CVD mortality with internal alpha-particle dose was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed at doses <1.0 Gy after having adjusted for nonradiation factors, ERR/Gy = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.09, 1.92). These updated results provide good evidence for a linear trend in risk of CVD incidence with external gamma-ray dose. The trend for CVD incidence with internal alpha-particle dose is less clear due to the impact of issues concerning the use of dose estimates based on below the limit of detection bioassay measurements.",Included

Ionizing radiation commonly used in the radiotherapy of brain tumours can cause adverse side effects to surrounding normal brain tissue.

Adult male Wistar rats were investigated 30, 60 or 90 days after whole-body irradiation with fractionated doses of gamma rays (the total dose of 4 Gy). For the study of alterations of the numbers of proliferating cells and precise identification of cell specific phenotype through the migratory pathway, the immunohistochemistry for either doublecortin (DCX), cell marker for immature neurons or glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) for labeling of astrocytes were used.

CONTEXT: Radiotherapy is frequently administered as adjuvant treatment in patients with clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients. However, a CVE was found significantly more frequently in IRR men but not in women. Further research into the long-term effects of cranial radiotherapy seems mandatory. The potential risks of radiotherapy have to be taken into account when radiotherapy is considered in NFPA patients, and long-term follow-up is recommended.",Included

The pathogenesis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is poorly understood and precursor cells are not known. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the microstructural characteristics of the brain lobes following radiotherapy (RT) for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) at distinct times. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D-T1-weighted imaging was performed in 70 age-and sex-matched subjects, 24 of whom were pre-treatment patients. The patients were divided into three groups, according to the time following completion of RT. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) volume were determined. The DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and the GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Compared with the pre-RT group, the mean FA values in the left parietal lobe white matter (WM) and right cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05). In addition, the mean FA values in the right parietal lobe WM decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05), compared with the pre-RT group. The FA level in the right temporal lobe remained significantly decreased, compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. Furthermore, compared with pre-RT group, the GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobe, right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and left cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05), and in the bilateral temporal lobe, parietal lobe, right frontal lobe and left cerebellum, the GM volume decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05). The GM volume in the right temporal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe and bilateral cerebellum remained significantly decreased compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. A combination of DTI and VBM may be used to determine radiation-induced brain injury in patients treated for NPC. Copyright © 2017, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included

The endocrine function of 59 patients with pituitary tumours who were treated in our unit between 1962 and 1982 is reviewed. There were 20 patients with growth hormone (GH) secreting adenomas, 17 with prolactinomas (1 tumour secreted both GH and prolactin), 14 corticotrophin (ACTH) secreting adenomas and nine non-functioning pituitary adenomas. Patients were treated with pituitary surgery and/or irradiation, with and without the addition of drugs. Patients treated with drugs alone were not included. Following combined surgery, radiotherapy and bromocriptine therapy only two acromegalic patients had persistently raised growth hormone levels and five continued to be hyperprolactinaemic. Pituitary irradiation alone was associated with the development of hypothyroidism in three of eight patients. A delayed but significant fall in free thyroxine index (p less than 0.01) was noted in patients receiving 4500 cGy radiotherapy and surgery. Four patients also developed delayed ACTH deficiency at times varying from one to six years after treatment. It is concluded that patients who have received pituitary surgery or irradiation require regular long-term endocrine assessment.",Included

The effects of ionizing radiation on pineal melatonin and on key enzymes of its metabolism have been studied in our laboratory. After adaptation to an artificial light/dark cycle of 12:12 h, male Wistar rats were fractionally whole-body irradiated with a dose of 2.4 Gy of gamma-rays twice a week up to total doses of 4.8, 9.6 or 14.4 Gy. Irradiation and sham-irradiation were performed in the late afternoon. The rats were sacrificed at 24:00 to 01:00 h in darkness, 6 h, 3 or 5 days after the last exposure. Pineal and serum melatonin concentrations, pineal activities of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and of monoamine oxidase (MAO) were determined. The NAT activities in the rats irradiated with 4.8 and 9.6 Gy decreased at some intervals without changes of melatonin concentration. Irradiation with a total dose of 14.4 Gy decreased NAT activity and the concentration of pineal and serum melatonin 6 h and 3 days after the last exposure. The activity of MAO, estimated only in the rats irradiated with the dose of 14.4 Gy, increased significantly 3 days after irradiation. The fractionated irradiation up to the dose of 14.4 Gy caused a transient decrease in pineal melatonin synthesis. This could be the consequence of preferential oxidative deamination of serotonin in comparison with its N-acetylation, leading to melatonin biosynthesis.",Included

Late pathological changes in the microvascular system after the acute irradiation (3 Gy) were not found. In the same time, after chronic irradiation with equivalent dose (the accumulated dose was 3 Gy) the depletion of endothelial cell population, and multiple foci of minor pathological changes of endotheliocyte ultrastructure at as many as 50% of the population were revealed. It may be more likely to lead to reduction of tolerance of brain microvascular system to an acute radiation (10 Gy) in the late period after chronic exposure.

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of age on the learning and memory dysfunction induced by cranial radiation in the male Wistar rat. Ninety-six 45-day-old, 70 4-month-old, and 78 18-month-old male rats were divided in two equal groups: (i) irradiated and (ii) control. A course of whole-brain radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions over 12 days) was administered to the irradiated group, while the control group received sham irradiation. Sequential behavioral studies including one and two-way avoidance tests were undertaken before and after the 7 months following radiation. The results suggest that radiation induced progressive and irreversible memory dysfunction in elderly (18-month-old) rats, but this effect was partial or almost reversible in the 4-month-old and 45-day-old rats, respectively. In return, the learning dysfunction was age non-dependent despite the fact that is occurs more rapidly in the young (45 days, 4 months) rats.",Included

Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty-eight 45-day-old Wistar rats received whole brain fractionated radiation (30 Gy), whereas 48 rats received sham irradiation. Four irradiated subgroups were defined: saline, 37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg Ethyol. Sequential behavioral studies including one-way and two-way avoidance tasks were undertaken before and after radiation. Result(s): Before radiation, the performances of all groups were similar. For the one-way avoidance task, at 1, 3, and 6 months postradiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (75 or 150 mg/kg) irradiated rats (p <= 0.001). Nevertheless, lower percentage of avoidance (p <= 0.001) was only seen at 1 month postradiation in saline-irradiated rats, after comparison with their preradiation values. For the two-way avoidance task, performed only after radiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (150 or 75 mg/kg) irradiated rats at 1, 2.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months (p = 0.000). Rats treated with Ethyol did not differ from sham-irradiated rats in both avoidance tasks, except for the 37.5 mg/kg-Ethyol group which showed lower performances 6 months postradiation (p = 0.005, one-way avoidance).

This radiation, even in a lethal dose, was found to induce no significant changes in the hepatic levels of cAMP. In contrast, an abrupt short-lasting increase in the levels of cAMP was observed in brain and intestinal mucosa after a 500-rd-irradiation, and a progressive long-lasting increase in its levels in the intestinal mucosa and, especially, in the brain was found after a 750-rd-irradiation. It is concluded that these organs contain different cAMP systems, which would explain, at least in part, their dissimilar responses to the ionizing rays.",Included

In our previous work we established conditions to study the contribution of non-neuronal cells to the process of goldfish optic nerve regeneration. This issue has been studied successfully by adapting the use of X-irradiation to manipulate division of non-neuronal cells associated with the injured nerve. The regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells was determined subsequent to the X-ray treatment. In this work we present an analysis of the molecular events associated with regeneration and enhanced regenerative capacity which follows X-irradiation. Under normal conditions the non-neuronal cells surrounding an intact nerve released axonal growth inhibitors, the level of which was only slightly sensitive to X-irradiation. In contrast, regenerating nerves showed a marked decrease in substances having an inhibitory effect on sprouting in vitro. Moreover, their level was significantly reduced following X-irradiation which was accompanied by increased accumulation of fibrous collagen adjacent to astrocytes. The alteration in the reciprocal relationship between the axon and the surrounding non-neuronal cells was also manifested by changes in the profile of labeled proteins released by the non-neuronal cells. The results of this work, therefore, indicate the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the environment provided by the cells surrounding the regenerating fibers and thus may open a new perspective relating to the capacity of neurons to regenerate.",Included

Histochemical study on carbohydrate metabolism and acid phosphatase activation]. The disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of acid phosphatases with and without protection by O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (HR) were studied in irradiated rat brains by means of the light microscope. The histochemically demonstrable deposition of glycogen and acid mucopolysaccharides serves as a criterion for a reversible lesion of the irradiated cerebral tissue. The extent of local activation of repair processes following to irradiation can be determined by the quantity of acid phosphatases in the lysosomes. For the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy, HR seems to exert a protective effect on the cellular metabolism of the irradiated cerebral tissue shown by a slight decrease of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide deposits compared to the untreated animals. However, when exceeding a threshold dose of 10 Gy, the deposition of carbohydrates in the HR group is strongly increased. A slightly increased activity of acid phosphatases induced by HR can be supposed at best for the dose range of 5 to 7.5 Gy. If the dose is even more increased, the reverse effect found in the carbohydrate metabolism, too, and an increased activation of acid phosphatases in the control group will be observed. This unexpected reversion of the protective effect could be related to the assumed inhibitory effect of HR on the ATPases and thus on the anaerobic part of glycolysis or to a breakdown of the cell interaction system of endothelial cells, glia cells, and neurons.",Included

The non-cancer mortality data for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular diseases from Report 13 on the atomic bomb survivors published by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation were analysed to investigate the dose-response for the influence of radiation on these detrimental health effects. Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data. Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that all fitted the data about equally well. Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice. This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties. For CVD, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses. The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose. For mortalities related to cardiovascular diseases, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals. The MMI approach described here resolves a dilemma in practical radiation protection when one is forced to select between models with profoundly different dose-responses for risk estimates.",Included

Mean age of the persons was 41. Vegetative dystonia syndrome was diagnosticated in 50% of examined subjects.

The conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerves, as well as the neuromuscular transmission were normal. No substantial changes in parameters of the soleus H- and M-responses were detected. A decreased amplitude and increased latency of the evoked skin sympathetic potential were found indicating a decreased tone of the adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstrictors and cholinergic sudomotor fibres, that may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the sensory, vegetotrophovascular disorders for these subjects. Decreased activity of the sympathetic autonomic system causes permanent course of the vegetative dystonia syndrome and more seldom the parasympathetic autonomic paroxysms. A decreased tone of the sympathetic autonomic system may be due to the monoaminergic neuromediation inhibition (decreased noradrenaline and dopamine excretion for the same subjects), that can induce psychoemotional disorders, depression and sleep-wakeness cycle disorders.",Included

Background and purpose: To evaluate the impact of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in adult WHO grade II-III intracranial ependymoma (IEPN). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 172 pathologically confirmed adult grade II-III IEPN patients from 12 institutions were eligible. Of them, 106 (61.6%) and 66 (38.4%) patients were grade II and III, respectively. For grade II and III IEPNs, 51 (48.1%) and 59 (89.4%) patients received PORT, respectively. The median dose to the primary tumor bed was 54.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy for grade II and III patients, respectively. The prognostic impact of sex, age, performance, WHO grade, location, size, surgical extent, and PORT on local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up period for survivors was 88.1 months. The 5-/10-year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 64.8%/54.0%, 56.4%/44.8%, and 76.6%/71.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant PORT significantly improved LC (P = 0.002), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.043). Older age (P < 0.001), WHO grade III (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.004), and lesser surgical extent (P < 0.001) were also negative factors for OS. Adjuvant PORT also improved LC (P = 0.010), PFS (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.069) on multivariate analysis for grade II IEPNs.

1847,"Edaravone protects ovaries from radiation-induced apoptosis. Objective: Ovaries are very sensitive and prone to radiation-related damage. Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Edaravone is a potent free radical scavenger, which has been clinically used to treat the neuronal damage following acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose is to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone and to investigate the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in rat ovaries after radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups. 1: control group, 2: sham group (only radiation), 3: 450 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group, 4: 45 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed. Histologic changes under light microscopy and immunoreactivity for anticaspase-3 were noted and compared between the four groups. Result(s): There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts, vascular congestion, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and interstitial cell degeneration between the groups. Radiation causes deterioration of histopathological parameters. Administration of edaravone at different doses seems to reverse these alterations and alleviate the injury. Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be enhanced by edaravone. Conclusion(s): This is the first study evaluating the protective effects of edaravone on radiation-induced ovarian damage.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant role of melatonin against radiation-induced cataract in the rat lens after total cranial irradiation with a single 5 Gray (Gy) dose of gamma irradiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experiment. The rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The control group did not receive melatonin or irradiation but received both 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally and sham irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The melatonin plus IR group received irradiation to the total cranium plus 5 mg/kg/day melatonin intraperitoneally. The melatonin group received only 5 mg/kg/day melatonin plus sham-irradiation. Biochemical parameters measured in murine lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens antioxidant capacity, as measured by levels of total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activity, significantly increased in melatonin, control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the IR group. Lens glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased in control and melatonin groups when compared with the IR group.

1892,"Elevated DNA damage in a mouse model of oxidative stress: impacts of ionizing radiation and a protective dietary supplement. Transgenic growth hormone (Tg) mice express elevated free radical processes and a progeroid syndrome of accelerated ageing. We examined bone marrow cells of Tg mice and their normal (Nr) siblings for three markers of DNA damage and assessed the impact of free radical stress using ionizing radiation. We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice. Based on our data, the dietary supplement appeared to scavenge free radicals before they could cause damage. This study validates Tg mice as an exemplary model of oxidative stress and radiation hypersensitivity and documents unprecedented radioprotection by a dietary supplement comprised of ingredients available to the general public.",Included

PURPOSE: To investigate effects of neuro-immuno-modulation on wound healing by observing changes of cytokines and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones in acute stress reaction in rats with wound and combined local radiation injury.METHODS: Sixty female Wistar rats (weighting 200 +/- 20 g) were randomly divided into normal control group, wound group and combined wound-local radiation (CWR) group (25 Gy local radiation post wound), 20 rats in each group. Contents of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma and IL-4 in serum were measured and changes of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoid (GC) in serum were analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunologic assay, respectively at different time points post wound and radiation.RESULTS: (1) The level of IFN-gamma, one of the Th1 cell cytokines increased significantly at 14 d post CWR, which was markedly higher than that in control group and wound group. However, the level of IL-4, IL-1beta and IL-6, one of the Th2 cell cytokines, did not show obvious change. (2) Ratio of Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) in wound group and CWR group increased significantly at 7 d after wound and radiation, which suggested that Th1/Th2 balance drifted to Th1 immune response. The ratio of Th1/Th2 in wound group returned to the normal level up to 14 d after the wound and radiation, while the Th1/Th2 ratio in CWR group increased persistently and was much higher than that in control and wound groups. (3) Level of serous ACTH and GC in CWR group increased at 3 d post wound and radiation, and among them, level of GC showed statistically significant increase, which was much higher than that in control and wound groups.CONCLUSION: Level of serous neurohormone GC in rats increased significantly immediately after wound and radiation; while the level of IFN-gamma showed significant increase only up to 14 d after wound and radiation, and the Th1/Th2 imbalance sustained till 28 d post wound and radiation. In order to reduce acute damage caused by CWR, organic immune system and nerve system showed up a marked regulate effects simultaneously and mutually.

To investigate the effect of fractionated whole-brain irradiation on nonhuman primates, 6-9-year-old male rhesus monkeys were irradiated with 40 Gy delivered as two 5-Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed 5 days/week for 4 months prior to fractionated whole-brain irradiation and for 11 months after irradiation using a Delayed-Match-to-Sample (DMS) task at both low and high cognitive loads. Local rates of cerebral glucose metabolism were measured prior to and 9 months after irradiation using [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography. Low cognitive load trials did not reveal a significant reduction in performance until 7 months after irradiation; performance then declined progressively. In high cognitive load trials, the initial impairment was observed ~1 month after irradiation. This was followed by a transient recovery period over the next 1-2 months, after which performance declined progressively through 11 months after irradiation. Nine months after irradiation, glucose uptake during the DMS task was decreased in the cuneate and prefrontal cortex and was increased in the cerebellum and thalamus compared with the levels prior to irradiation. Results from this pilot study suggest that the radiation-induced changes in cognition and brain metabolism observed in rhesus monkeys may be similar to those observed in brain tumor patients receiving brain irradiation.",Included

Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis.",Included

One hundred and five operators of the control unit of the Kursk nuclear power station (NPS) have been studied: 45 people after the shift (main group) and 60 - in the day off. The shift was found to exert a significant influence on the functional state of the nervous system promoting the development or aggravation of autonomous dysfunction. In some cases, it causes an elevation of blood pressure to the level of risk for cerebral vascular disease. The effect of shift on the cerebral bioelectric activity of NPS operators manifests itself in the decrease of percentage of unchanged EEG, increase of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads. These changes may be caused by weariness as well as the effects of adverse factors the operators were exposed to at the NPS. The authors suggest to include the methods of evaluating of autonomous dysfunction and recording of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads in a special clinical examination of NPS operators.",Included
1991,"Radiation-induced changes in the profile of spinal cord serotonin, prostaglandin synthesis, and vascular permeability. PURPOSE: To investigate the profile of biochemical and physiological changes induced in the rat spinal cord by radiation, over a period of 8 months.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The thoraco-lumbar spinal cords of Fisher rats were irradiated to a dose of 15 Gy. The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system.",Included
2002,"Total body 100-mGy X-irradiation does not induce Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis or memory impairment in mice. The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. Possible cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from various sources. Early transcriptional response in murine brain to low-dose X-rays (100 mGy) has been reported, suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. To investigate acute and late transcriptional, pathological and cognitive consequences of low-dose radiation, we applied an acute dose of 100-mGy total body irradiation (TBI) with X-rays to C57BL/6J Jms mice. We collected hippocampi and analyzed expression of 84 AD-related genes. Mouse learning ability and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test. We performed in vivo PET scans with (11)C-PIB, a radiolabeled ligand for amyloid imaging, to detect fibrillary amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation, and examined characteristic AD pathologies with immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein (APP), Abeta, tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). mRNA studies showed significant downregulation of only two of 84 AD-related genes, Apbb1 and Lrp1, at 4 h after irradiation, and of only one gene, Il1alpha, at 1 year after irradiation. Spatial learning ability and memory were not significantly affected at 1 or 2 years after irradiation. No induction of amyloid fibrillogenesis or changes in APP, Abeta, tau, or p-tau expression was detected at 4 months or 2 years after irradiation. TBI induced early or late transcriptional alteration in only a few AD-related genes but did not significantly affect spatial learning, memory or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included

O-2A progenitor cells are the stem cells of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. In the epithermal reactor beams used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for treatment of brain tumors, fission neutrons are a contaminating component. To estimate the radiosensitivity of the O-2A progenitors for fission neutrons, an in vivo-in vitro clonogenic assay was used. Radiosensitivity of progenitors obtained from the spinal cord of 1- or 5-day-old rats or the optic nerve of 2- or 12-week-old rats for 1 MeV fission neutrons was compared to that for 300 kVp X rays. Dose-survival curves were fitted according to the linear-quadratic model. The resulting beta component was very small to negligible. Progenitor cells obtained from rats of different ages show differences in radiosensitivity, characterized by different alpha values. RBE values for fission neutrons were 3.5 for 1-day-old spinal cord, 3.2 for 5-day-old spinal cord, 3.0 for 2-week-old optic nerve, and 4.3 for 12-week-old optic nerve. These high RBE values indicate the importance of minimizing the fast-neutron component in the epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT.",Included
2083,"Zinc administration modulates radiation-induced oxidative injury in lens of rat. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant role of zinc (Zn) against radiation-induced cataract in the rat lens after total cranial irradiation with a single 5 Gray (Gy) dose of gamma irradiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experiment. The control group did not receive Zn or irradiation but received 1-ml saline orally plus sham-irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The IR plus Zn group received irradiation to total cranium plus 10 mg/kg/day Zn intraperitoneally. Biochemical parameters measured in rat lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens total (enzymatic plus non-enzymatic) superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), glutathione reductase (GRD), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities significantly increased in the IR plus Zn groups when compared with the IR group. However, TSSA, GRD and GST activities were significantly lower in the IR group when compared with the control group. Lens non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) in the IR plus Zn group was significantly increased compared to that of the IR group. Lens xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the IR group significantly increased compared to that of both the control and IR plus Zn groups.CONCLUSION: Zn has clear antioxidant properties and prevented oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals generated by ionizing radiation in rat lenses.",Included
2095,"Brain irradiation leads to persistent neuroinflammation and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in a region-specific manner. Long-term cognitive deficits are observed after treatment of brain tumors or metastases by radiotherapy. Treatment optimization thus requires a better understanding of the effects of radiotherapy on specific brain regions, according to their sensitivity and interconnectivity. In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere. These structural damages translated into selective behavioral changes including spatial memory loss, disinhibition of anxiety-like behaviors, hyperactivity and pain hypersensitivity, but no significant alteration in motor coordination and grip strength abilities. Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction.",Included

The animals' heads were irradiated with gamma-quanta at a dose of 50 Gy, the rate of 6.7 cGy/s. Two minutes before or right after irradiation 15% ethanol solution (0.28 and 2.25 g/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. It was established that changes of interneuronal contacts in gamma-irradiation of the head were similar in nature to those caused by ethanol (2.25 g/kg). The effects of combined action of the above factors depended on the succession of exposure and a dose of ethanol. Slightly more noticeable synaptic changes, probably associated with mitochondrion affection and hyperhydration, were noted in ethanol administration (2.25 g/kg) after irradiation of the head.",Included

Ultrastructural morphometric studies of the muscle fibres demonstrated diminished volume of sarcomer and accumulation of glycogen granules. The mean number of mitochondrial profiles decreased. The investigations of the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle showed diminution of the mean number of synaptic vesicles and swelling of the mitochondria.

2148,"Myelin repair by Schwann cells in the regenerating goldfish visual pathway: regional patterns revealed by X-irradiation. In the regenerating goldfish optic nerves, Schwann cells of unknown origin reliably infiltrate the lesion site forming a band of peripheral-type myelinating tissue by 1-2 months, sharply demarcated from the adjacent new CNS myelin. To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue.",Included

The dose analysis shows that 59% of the brain received a dose in excess of the reference surface dose, and that portions of the brain received doses greater than 300% of the reference surface dose. The regions of high dose are illustrated in isodose distributions. This information may be useful in evaluating potential tumor induction following radiation exposure.",Included

2165,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation. The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included

Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The paper describes for the first time the results of the radiation effect study using the example of the analysis of circulatory system disease mortality in newly established cohort combining the population exposed in 1950-1960 due to 2 radiation incidents in the Southern Urals (the Techa River and East-Urals radioactive Trace). The cohort consists of 60,205 people. Over a 65-year follow up period 14,830 deaths from all diseases of the circulatory system were registered. Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence.

Background: Prior research has indicated neuroanatomical abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia. To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Method(s): Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Result(s): Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusion(s): A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood. Low-dose irradiation of the fetal primate may be useful for modeling key features of the pathology described in schizophrenic patients. © 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Included

OBJECTIVE: To explore the histological, electrophysiological, radiological, and behavioral effects of radiosurgery using a new model of proton beam radiosurgery (PBR) of the rodent hippocampus.METHODS: Forty-one rats underwent PBR of the right hippocampus with nominal doses of 5 to 130 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE). Three control animals were untreated. Three months after PBR, 41 animals were evaluated with the Morris water maze, 23 with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 22 with intrahippocampal microelectrode recordings. Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain.

2253,"Passive avoidance learning and memory of 56Fe sham-irradiated and irradiated human apoE transgenic mice. Cranial irradiation is associated with long-term cognitive impairments, including deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4). Compared with epsilon3, epsilon4 increases the risk of cognitive impairments following various challenges while epsilon2 provides relative protection. Women are at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, particularly those carrying epsilon4. In previous experiments using male and female mice expressing human apoE-isoforms E2, E3 or E4 under the mouse apoE promoter, we showed that cranial irradiation with 137Cs (10 Gy) results in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments that are sex- and apoE-isoform dependent. 137Cs is a form of irradiation often used in the clinical setting. To investigate whether 56Fe irradiation also has sex- and apoE-isoform dependent effects on hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in human apoE mice, we sham-irradiated and irradiated 2-month old male and female human apoE mice at 3 Gy and assessed their performance in a passive avoidance learning and memory test three to five months later.",Included
2254,"Long-term outcomes of surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy for treatment of spinal ependymoma: A retrospective multicenter study by the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group. Background: We sought to determine the surgical treatment and functional outcome and identify the predictors of survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal cord ependymoma using data collected from the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group database. Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. © 2013 The Author(s).",Included
2271,"Low-dose total-body carbon-ion irradiations induce early transcriptional alteration without late Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. The cause and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown. Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included

Many agents have been used for neuroprotection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible protective role of royal jelly on radiationinduced brain damage. Design(s): In the present study, thirty-two adult male Dawley rats, 8-12 weeks of age and weighing 275+/-35 grams were randomly divided into four groups each group compressed eight animals: group 1: control (C), group 2: irradiated rats (RT), group 3: irradiated rats with oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 days (RT+RJ50), group 4: oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 day (RJ50). Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation delivered to total cranium. Royal jelly was administered before and after irradiation per day for 7 days. At the seventh day of study, when rats were under ketamine anesthesia samples of brain tissues were taken and biochemical and microscopic examination after sacrification. Result(s): An increase in brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (P<0.001) were detected while significant decreases in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (P<0.001) in irradiation alone group when compared to control group. Increases in MDA were relatively well prevented by royal jelly. The administration of RJ increased to activity of SOD and CAT enzymes and decreased MDA level in the brain tissue (p<0.001). On histopathological examination, royal jelly reduced edema, necrosis, vasodilation and neuronal degeneration. Conclusion(s): The results obtained from this study demonstrated that with royal jelly prevented the damage that develops in brain following irradiation.

Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.

2295,"Changes in myelin basic protein and demyelination in the rat brain within 3 months of single 2-, 10-, or 30-Gy whole-brain radiation treatments: Laboratory investigation. Object. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between changes in myelin basic protein (MBP) levels during the acute and subacute phases of central nervous system injury following whole-brain radiation and delayed demyelination in the radiation-injured brain tissue. Methods. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with single fractions of 2, 10, or 30 Gy of whole-brain radiation. The authors measured MBP gene expression and protein levels in the brain tissue by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 week and 1-3 months following irradiation to monitor myelin changes in the brain. Demyelination was determined with Luxol fast blue myelin staining and routine histopathological and electron microscopy examination of injured brain tissue. The changes in MBP levels in the different animal groups at specific time points were correlated with demyelination in corresponding dose groups. Results. At 1 month after applying the 10 and 30 Gy of radiation, MBP mRNA expression showed a transient but significant decrease, followed by recovery to baseline levels at 3 months after treatment. The MBP levels were decreased by only 70-75% at 1 month after 10 and 30 Gy of radiation. At 2-3 months after applying the higher dose of 30 Gy, however, the MBP levels continued to decline, and typical demyelination changes were observed with myelin staining and ultrastructural examination. Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that the early radiation-induced MBP changes between 1 and 3 months af ter single treatments of 10 and 30 Gy of radiation to the whole brain are indicative of permanent injury shown as de myelination of irradiated brain tissue.",Included

2301,"Increased hippocampal TrkA expression ameliorates cranial radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment and cognitive deficit via PI3K/AKT signaling. Cognitive deficit is one of the most serious complications of cranial radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of this cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) were investigated following whole-brain irradiation (WBI). Young male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent WBI at a single dose of 10 Gy. WBI was determined to result in notable memory decline and substantial neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus 3 months post-irradiation. Compared with the control group, TrkA protein expression was greater in irradiated rats 1 week after WBI, which then decreased significantly by the 3-month time-point. However, no difference in NGF expression was observed from 1 day to 3 months post-WBI. Overexpression of hippocampal TrkA in rats using adeno-associated virus ameliorated memory decline induced by irradiation. Additionally, upregulating TrkA expression rescued irradiation-induced hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and promoted neurogenesis. PI3K, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also revealed to be significantly inhibited by WBI, which was ameliorated by TrkA overexpression. Findings of the present study indicated that the TrkA-dependent signaling pathway may serve a critical role in radiotherapy-induced cognitive deficit and impairments in neurogenesis.",Included
2333,"Phase measurement of cognitive impairment specific to radiotherapy. PURPOSE: Memory impairment is an early-delayed effect of radiotherapy (RT). The prospective longitudinal measurement of the cognitive phase effects from RT was conducted on treated and untreated brain tumor patients. The study design investigated semantic vs. perceptual and visual vs. verbal memory to determine the most disease-specific measure of RT-related changes and understanding of the neurotoxicity from RT to the brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tests of memory that had previously shown RT-related phasic changes were compared with experimental tests of memory to test hypotheses about cognition targeted to the neural toxicity of RT. The results from 41 irradiated and 29 nonirradiated patients with low-grade, supratentorial tumors were analyzed. The methods controlled for comorbid white matter risk, recurrence, interval after treatment, and age (18-69 years). The effects were examined before RT and at three points after RT to 1 year using a mixed effects model that included interval, group, surgical status, medication use, practice, and individual random effects. Four new tests of memory and other candidate cognitive tests were investigated, and a post hoc analysis of a comprehensive battery of tests was performed to identify the cognitive processes most specific to RT.RESULTS: The RT effects on memory were identified in the treated group only; among the new tests of memory and the complete neurocognitive battery, the RT effects were significant only for delayed recall (p < 0.009) and interval to recognize (p < 0.002). Tumor location was not related to the treatment effect. Memory decline was specific to retrieval of semantic memories; a double dissociation of semantic from perceptual visual memory was demonstrated in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate memory dependent on the semantic cortex and the hippocampal memory system. A cognitive measurement that is brief but specific to neural mechanisms is effective and feasible for studies of RT damage.",Included

Method(s): Twenty-seven adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 9 groups (each n=3). The rabbit brains were irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy. The observation posts included pre-radiation and 1 to 8 weeks after radiation. Each group underwent single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, after the completion of image acquisition, the animals were sacrificed, and histological specimens were obtained. Pathological changes were analyzed combined with MRS changes. Result(s): The metabolic ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) increased first and then decreased obviously. Cho/Cr was 1.52 +/- 0.28 pre-radiation, 3.20 +/- 0.72 at 4 weeks, and 2.04 +/- 0.05 at 8 weeks after radiation. The metabolic ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/Cr showed significant decrease tendency, which decreased to 1.28 +/- 0.05 8 weeks after radiation from pre-radiation value of 1.97 +/- 0.25. The metabolic ratios of Cho/NAA showed significant increase after irradiation, which increased to 2.04 +/- 0.78 at 8 weeks after radiation, while the value was 1.19 +/- 0.15 pre-irradiation.

Commonly seen in the sample was vegetovascular dystonia, also revealed were a varying degree discirculatory encephalopathy, acute disturbances in cerebral circulation, dyscirculatory myelopathy. Vascular abnormalities may develop at any age but in young adulthood they tend to occur more frequently. Clinical manifestations of vegetovascular dystonia were characterized by profound mixed type vegetative crises. Even if treated, vegetovascular dystonia tends to acquire remittent-and-progredient course leading to decompensation very soon. Strokes run atypical course: hemorrhages occur more often than not; circulatory disorders come about against the background of normal arterial blood pressure or insignificant its fluctuations. Hemorrhage may run gradually progressing course, which fact makes their diagnosis very difficult even with modern techniques being involved in relevent studies.

Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction.",Included

Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies.",Included

V79 Chinese hamster cells have been exposed to X-rays or fast neurons or to the two radiations given sequentially. Cells exposed to a priming dose of X-rays and then exposed immediately to a series of neutron doses regard the X-ray dose as equivalent to a neutron dose giving the same surviving fraction (iso-effective). If the cells are exposed to a neutron dose followed by X-rays the resulting survival is higher than would be obtained if the primary dose had been an iso-effective X-ray dose. However, it is lower than would be expected if the two radiations acted independently. The results imply that there is interaction between the damage caused by X-rays and fast neurons. If the two radiations are given 3 hours apart they act independently.",Included
2541,"Neuroprotective effect of liu wei di huang tang on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. OBJECTIVE To explore the effect and mechanisms of LW-AFC, a new formula derived from Liu Wei Di Huang Tang, on irradiation-induced reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n=10): control group, LW-AFC group (1.6 g?kg<sup>-1</sup>), Liu Wei Di Huang Tang (LW) group (10 g-kg<sup>-1</sup>), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) group, irradiation group, irradiation+ LW group, and irradiation + LW-AFC group. Reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis was induced by cranial irradiation. LW-AFC was administered by oral gavage for 30 d after cranial irradiation treatment. Immunofluorescence and Nissl's staining were performed for histological morphology assessment. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was used in the detection of proliferation cells. The peripheral blood and hippocampal homogenate were collected to measure the content of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-y), interleukin-1 (3 (IL-1(3), IL-4 and IL-10. The hippocampal homogenate was used for Western blot to detect the BDNFkappaB signal pathway, including extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and BDNF target protein. Morris water maze and new object recognition test were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. The mice forced swimming and tail suspension test were used to assess alteration in depressive behavior. Long term potentiation was used to examine the synaptic plasticity change of mice. RESULTS Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced after irradiation of 20 Gray dose (10 Gray per day, total 2 d). LW-AFC treatment increased the BrdU number of irradiated mice (P<0.05). In Morris water maze test, LW-AFC group showed decreased escape latency in the learning period (P<0.05), while increased the number of crossing the platform in the memory period. LW-AFC can also reduce the immobility time of mice in the tail suspension test (P<0.01). CONCLUSION LW-AFC modulates adult neurogenesis to ameliorate cognitive impairment and reduce depressive behavior in radiation injury mice.",Included

BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to determine whether neuropsychologic functioning differs in breast cancer survivors 6 months after the completion of adjuvant treatment compared with women without cancer.METHODS: Participants were 187 women who were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I or stage II breast cancer and 187 age-matched and geographically matched women without cancer. Of the survivors, 97 had been treated after surgery with chemotherapy only or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and 90 had been treated after surgery with radiotherapy only (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer grading system).RESULTS: Small but statistically significant differences in cognitive functioning and cognitive impairment were observed in those survivors who were treated with chemotherapy and their matched controls, as well as in survivors treated with radiotherapy only and their matched controls. No group differences were observed with regard to cognitive symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Data from the current study suggest that cognitive deficits are subtle and likely the result of the general effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment rather than systemic treatment.",Included

A case-control study in long-term survivors from cancer in the head and neck region. BACKGROUND: Adult patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders have compromised quality of life (QoL). Whether this is due to their endocrine consequences (hypopituitarism), their underlying hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or both is still under debate. The aim of this trial was to measure quality of life (QoL) in long-term cancer survivors who have received a radiation dose to the basal part of the brain and the pituitary.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=101) treated for oropharyngeal or epipharyngeal cancer with radiotherapy followed free of cancer for a period of 4 to10 years were identified. Fifteen patients (median age 56 years) with no concomitant illness and no hypopituitarism after careful endocrine evaluation were included in a case-control study with matched healthy controls. Doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary region were calculated. QoL was assessed using the Symptom check list (SCL)-90, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and Psychological Well Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Level of physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire.RESULTS: The median accumulated dose was 1.9 Gy (1.5-2.2 Gy) to the hypothalamus and 2.4 Gy (1.8-3.3 Gy) to the pituitary gland in patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 6.0-9.3 Gy and 33.5-46.1 Gy, respectively in patients with epipharyngeal cancer (n=2). The patients showed significantly more anxiety and depressiveness, and lower vitality, than their matched controls.CONCLUSION: In a group of long time survivors of head and neck cancer who hade received a low radiation dose to the hypothalamic-pituitary region and who had no endocrine consequences of disease or its treatment QoL was compromised as compared with well matched healthy controls.",Included
2562,"Spatial learning and memory deficits induced by exposure to iron-56-particle radiation. It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.",Included
2565,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation. Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included

Mechanical injury to the adult mammalian spinal cord results in permanent loss of structural integrity at the lesion site and of the brain-controlled function distal to the lesion. Some of these consequences were permanently averted by altering the cellular constituents at the lesion site with x-irradiation delivered within a critical time window after injury. We have reported in a separate article that x-irradiation of sectioned adult rat spinal cord resulted in restitution of structural continuity and regrowth of severed corticospinal axons across and deep into the distal stump. Here, we report that after x-ray therapy of the lesion site severed corticospinal axons of transected adult rat spinal cord recover electrophysiologic control of activity of hindlimb muscles innervated by motoneurons distal to the lesion. The degree of recovery of control of muscle activity was directly related to the degree of restitution of structural integrity. This restitution of electrophysiologic function implies that the regenerating corticospinal axons reestablish connectivity with neurons within the target field in the distal stump. Our data suggest that recovery of structural continuity is a sufficient condition for the axotomized corticospinal neurons to regain some of their disrupted function in cord regions distal to the lesion site.",Included

Till now, there is no recognized treatment for RION. It is of great significance to study the natural progression of the RION, and to prevent and treat RION. Objective(s): This study was to establish an ideal radioactive optic nerve injury animal model. Method(s): Healthy 8-week SD rats with hygiene grade were randomly divided into normal control group and model group, with 6 rats in each group. The total 30 Gy dose of radiation with 3 portions was used to irradiate the head model group rats; ELISA was performed to analysis the changes of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations in blood 2, 4 and 8 weeks after irradiation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscope were performed to observe the changes of optic structure. The use and care of the experimental animals complied with the ARVO statement. Result(s): The concentrations of ET-1 in the model group were (23.18 +/- 0.11), (27.98 +/- 0.22), (33.90 +/- 0.11), (65.25 +/- 0.38) and (43.82 +/- 0.09) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (22.65 +/- 0.14), (23.18 +/- 0.19), (23.68 +/- 0.15), (24.23 +/- 0.12) and (23.58 +/- 0.16) pg/ml.

There were significant differences of ET-1 and vWF concentrations among different groups and time points (ET-1: F<inf>group</inf>=32.160, P=0.012 ; F<inf>time</inf>=21.180, P=0.023.vWF: F<inf>group</inf>=73.110, P=0.001; F<inf>time</inf>=46.180, P=0.002). The nerve fiber bundles was swelled with disordered arrangement and vacuolization 8 weeks after irradiation. Axon swell and atrophy, axons with myelin sheath layer plate separation were obtained. The rates of axon demyelination in the normal control group and model group were (1.35 +/- 0.79)% and (14.44 +/- 2.32)%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=14.07, P<0.01).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes.METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation.

Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50-500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation.",Included

The aim of this study was to investigate protective and antioxidant effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) and thymoquinone (TQ) in kidney tissue of rats exposed to cranial irradiation. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: IR group received irradiation (IR) to total cranium plus saline; IR plus NSO group received IR and NSO; IR plus TQ group received IR and TQ; sham group did not receive NSO, TQ or IR; control group of TQ received dimethyl sulfoxide; control group of NSO received saline.

Kidney TOS, OSI and LOOH levels were significantly lower in IR plus TQ, IR plus NSO and sham groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). TAS, PON and Cp activities in IR group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). PON and Cp activities were significantly higher in IR plus NSO and IR plus TQ groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restenosis complicates a significant proportion of endovascular and open vascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy. In contrast to the primary atheroma, restenosis is characterized by intimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that gamma radiation would reduce restenosis by limiting intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.METHODS: To demonstrate the effect of gamma radiation on smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo, a standardized bilateral carotid balloon catheter arterial injury was produced in 37 rats. A single dose of 750, 1500, or 2250 cGy (1cGy = 1 rad) gamma radiation was delivered to the right carotid artery at either 1 or 2 days after injury; the shielded contralateral carotid artery served as matched control. At 21 days after injury, vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ, and cross-sectional area of neointima was determined from axial sections using image analysis.RESULTS: Marked reductions in neointimal cross-sectional area were demonstrated in vessels subjected to 1500- and 2250-cGy radiation at both 1 and 2 days after injury. A less prominent effect was noted for 750 cGy, reaching statistical significance only at 2 days after injury. By two-way ANOVA, radiation dose (P = .0002), timing of radiation delivery (P = .003), and an interaction between timing and dose (P = .0278) were significantly associated with reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. At 1500 cGy, delivery of radiation 1 day after injury inhibited neointimal hyperplasia more prominently than the same dose 2 days after injury; a dose-response relation was evident at 1 day.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation may be an important adjunctive therapy for reducing the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty or endarterectomy.",Included

INTRODUCTION: Brain radiation necrosis (RN) is irreversible severe adverse effect after radiation therapy for brain tumors over 60 Gy. Effective treatment for this irreversible event has not been established. The lying mechanism of RN is to be elucidated in order to establish a new therapy. We have established brain RN mouse model using proton beam at the Wakasa Wan Energy research Center. In this model, RN was induced 8 months after irradiation and the histology of the necrosis recapitulated the human RN patients [Kondo N.2015]. So far, some researchers investigated the mechanism of RN based on protein level. However, with the advanced mass spectrometry technology, lipid mediator response to ionizing radiation was reported [Laiakis EC, 2014]. Therefore, in this study, lipid alteration after proton beam irradiation was investigated in mouse brain RN model using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizing imaging mass spectrometry (HR-MALDI-IMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generation of mouse brain RN model: C57BL/6J mice were irradiated in the restricted area of right brain at 60 Gy using proton beam. Tissue preparation: After 4 months later mouse was sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with cold PBS. The brain was extracted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in-80degreeC. The brain was sliced to a thickness of 4 mum with a cryostat and placed onto an indium tin oxide coated glass slide and stored at-20 degreeC until matrix application and subsequent HR-MALDI-IMS analysis. Each slide was anchored in vacuum deposition equipment and coated with 9-aminoacridine hemihydrates (9-AA) matrix layer obtained by sublimation at 220degreeC. The sequential sections were mounted onto glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis: HR-MALDI-IMS analysis was performed on a high-resolution microscopic imaging mass spectrometer (iMScope; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry data were acquired in negative and positive mode in the mass range of m/z 700-1000. Statistical Analysis: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed by Imaging MS Solution (ver 1, 12, 26; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). RESULT(S): Compared to non-irradiated area, in the irradiated right hemisphere, i) elevation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (34:1, 36:4, 36:1, 38:6, 40:6) and ii) decline of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (36:4, 38:4) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): The data indicated the phospholipid alterations after irradiation in mouse brain RN model in the chronic phase before establishment of RN. Further analysis for component of these phospholipids may include the precursor of lipid mediator, arachidonic acid (AA) or other fatty acids. We will investigate time-dependent change of phospholipids using mouse brain RN model and HR-MALDI-IMS analysis then finally find the responsible lipid mediators which induce brain RN.",Included
2782,"Effect of gonadotropin secretion rate on the radiosensitivity of the rat luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neuron and gonadotroph. To test the hypothesis that the functional state of hypothalamic LHRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs might alter their radiosensitivity, we determined the experimental conditions under which the gonadotropin response to castration could be impaired by a single dose of cranial irradiation. Single doses of cranial irradiation greater than 2000 rads were lethal to unshielded rats. Shielding of the oropharynx and esophagus allowed the animals to survive doses up to 5000 rads. Doses between 2000 and 5000 rads had no effect on basal gonadotropin levels for as long as 3 months after irradiation. Irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment, however, in the gonadotropin response to castration. Impairment of the gonadotropin levels of castrate animals occurred in animals that were irradiated either before or after castration. However, rats irradiated in the castrate state showed a decreased susceptibility to irradiation damage. Additionally, stimulation of the pituitary by LHRH agonist (LHRHa) 3 h before irradiation significantly reduced the impairment of gonadotropin secretion 12-20 weeks after irradiation (P less than 0.05). Thus, increased functional activity of the rat hypothalamus or pituitary at the time of irradiation, induced by either castration or acute LHRHa administration, was associated with some protection against the gonadotropin-lowering effect of irradiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that stimulation of gonadotropin secretion at the time of therapeutic cranial irradiation in humans might protect against subsequent impairment of gonadotropin secretion.",Included

Background: Brain irradiation (BI) in humans may cause behavioral changes, cognitive impairment and neuroendocrine dysfunction. The effect of BI on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is not fully understood. Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of BI on HPA axis responses under basal and stressful conditions as well as following pretreatment with dexamethasone (Dex). Method(s): Adult male rats were exposed to whole BI. HPA axis responses were examined at 2, 4, 9 and 20 weeks after BI. Histological evaluations of the irradiated rats and matched controls were conducted at 4 and 20 weeks after BI. Result(s): In contrast to the control group, the basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels were enhanced at 9 and 20 weeks after BI and the inhibitory effect of Dex was reduced. BI also caused hyposuppression of the adrenocortical response to stress. Histological assessment of the irradiated brains revealed hippocampal atrophy at 20 weeks after BI. The neuronal counts were lower only in the CA1 region of the irradiated brains. BI caused a decrease in the binding capacity of Dex to the hippocampal cytosolic fraction. Conclusion(s): Enhanced stress-induced HPA axis responses and the reduced effect of Dex suggest that BI has delayed effects on HPA axis responses as manifested by impairment of the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids (GCs). The mechanisms underlying these effects of BI are unknown. It is possible that the marked BI-induced damage in the hippocampus, which plays an important role in the regulation of the feedback effect of GCs, may cause abnormal HPA axis responses following BI. © 2012 S.

2794,"Secondary radiation damage as the main cause for unexpected volume effects: a histopathologic study of the parotid gland. PURPOSE: To elucidate with a histopathological study the mechanism of region-dependent volume effects in the partly irradiated parotid gland of the rat.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Wistar rats were locally X-irradiated with collimators with conformal radiation portals for 100% volume and 50% cranial/caudal partial volumes. Single doses up to 40 Gy were applied. Parotid saliva samples were collected, and the three lobes of the parotid gland were examined individually on the macro- and micromorphologic level up to 1 year after irradiation.RESULTS: Dose-dependent loss of gland weight was observed 1 year after total or partial X-irradiation. Weight loss of the glands correlated very well with loss of secretory function. Irradiating the cranial 50% volume (implicating a shielded lateral lobe) resulted in substantially more damage in terms of weight loss and loss of secretory function than 50% caudal irradiation (shielding the ventral and dorsal lobe). Histologic examinations of the glands 1 year after irradiation revealed that the shielded lateral lobe was severely affected, in contrast to the shielded ventral and dorsal lobes. Time studies showed that irradiation of the cranial 50% volume caused late development of secondary damage in the shielded lateral lobe, becoming manifest between 240 and 360 days after irradiation. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the observed region-dependent volume effect for late function loss in the rat parotid gland after partial irradiation is mainly caused by secondary events in the shielded lateral lobe. The most probable first step (primary radiation event) in the development of this secondary damage is radiation exposure to the hilus region (located between the ventral and dorsal lobe). By injuring major excretory ducts and supply routes for blood and nerves in this area, the facility system necessary for proper functioning of the nonexposed lateral lobe is seriously affected. The unexpected volume effect in the rat might have consequences for treatment strategies in radiotherapy, implicating not only salivary glands but also other organs with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of radiosensitive elements, a situation wherein volume effects have not been anticipated up to now.",Included

2805,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence?. Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included
2811,"Enhanced excitability induced by ionizing radiation in the kindled rat. Evidence derived from both clinical and experimental investigations has suggested an influence of ionizing radiation on focal epileptogenicity. To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala. The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes. Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala, after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation. The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated (60)Co source (1.25 MeV). Generalized seizure thresholds were then redetermined at weekly intervals for 10 weeks and at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months. We observed no significant changes in seizure threshold during the postirradiation interval; however, we did observe persistent changes in seizure dynamics manifesting within the first week postirradiation. These consisted of an increased tendency for seizure activity to propagate into brain stem circuits during the primary ictus (i.e., ""running fits"") and an increased tendency for secondary convulsions to emerge postictally. These effects involving seizure dynamics have not been reported previously and appear to represent a radiation-induced disinhibition of one or more neural circuits. The disparity between these effects and earlier reports of seizure-suppressive effects resulting from analogous radiation exposures is discussed in relation to kindling and status epilepticus-induced pathogenesis within the hippocampus.",Included

2838,"Risk Factor for Incident Functional Disability and the Effect of a Preventive Exercise Program: A 4-Year Prospective Cohort Study of Older Survivors from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for incident functional disability among long-term evacuees of Iitate village after Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster (GEJE). We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, both the group with low-participation in the exercise program and the group with high-participation in the exercise program had a significantly lower rate of incident functional disability compared to those who did not participate at all (HR = 0.27, CI: 0.16-0.46; HR = 0.30, CI: 0.12-0.74, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-disaster BCL domains were useful to identify individuals at risk of functional disability after a major socio-technical disaster. Therefore, this instrument can be used to identify at-risk older adults who would benefit from early exercise programs to prevent incident functional disability.",Included
2846,"Metallothionein induction in human CNS in vitro: neuroprotection from ionizing radiation. PURPOSE: There have been extensive studies on the regulation of metallothionein (MT) synthesis, and its biological role in liver and kidney. Although there are few reports on brain MT, there is a growing interest in the role of MT in brain. There have been no publications to date on MT synthesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) following exposure to ionizing radiation. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures were used to examine the effect of ionizing radiation on MT mRNA and protein synthesis. In the same cultures, the neuroprotective effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd)-induced MT synthesis from high-dose radiation were also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary, serum-free, human CNS cultures were exposed to 30 or 60 Gy gamma-rays. The total MT protein was then measured by a Cd-heme assay, and mRNA for MT-II and MT-III was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release and apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis. Sublethal neuroglial injury was assessed morphologically using specific astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein--GFAP) and neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2--MAP2) immunohistochemical markers.RESULTS: The total MT protein content was increased 12h after exposure to 30Gy. The increase in MT content in response to 60Gy was not statistically significant. MT-II mRNA levels increased at 3 and 6h after exposure to 30Gy gamma-rays, with a maximum expression at 12-24 h. MT-III mRNA was not significantly affected. Exposure to 60 Gy, but not 30 Gy, caused a marked increase in LDH release. Cells exposed to 30 Gy or less showed some apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis, while exposure to 60 Gy resulted in a DNA smear confirmed by LDH assays. Preinduction of MT by 5 microM Cd or 100 microM Zn resulted in a significant reduction in radiation-induced LDH release. Morphological evaluations revealed that Cd or Zn preincubation led to relative preservation of MAP2 staining and GFAP.CONCLUSION: Both MT protein and MT-II mRNA can be induced in human CNS cells by ionizing radiation. Furthermore, induction of MT synthesis with Zn and Cd can protect human CNS cells from radiation-induced cytocidal and sublethal injuries. Both findings have implications in the development of strategies to protect human CNS tissue from damage during radiotherapy.",Included
2851,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain caused by acute radiation injuries. Moderate to severe acute pain is a common consequence of fullcourse radiotherapy. Improved analgesics are needed, but therapeutic development requires an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie acute radiation-associated pain (RAP). Our preliminary data suggest that transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels on sensory neurons play important roles in RAP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of various Trp channels in acute RAP using a mouse model of oral radiation-induced mucositis. Mice underwent high dose single fraction lingual irradiation or sham irradiation. This resulted in glossitis that was most severe at 10-12 days postirradiation and resolved within 20 days. Micewere euthanized on days 1, 5, 11, 21, and 45 post-irradiation. Functional analysis of trigeminal ganglia neurons was assessed via calcium imaging; this revealed significantly increased proportions of neurons that were sensitive to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), histamine (TRPV4 partial agonist), or TNF-alpha (a general inflammatory marker). These changes were seen as early as 1-day post-irradiation and lasted until the 21st day. Via quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented Trpv1 overexpression in the trigeminal ganglia neurons of tongueirradiated mice on days 11 and 21. Together, these results indicate that both TRPV1 and TRPV4 are activated and upregulated, and contribute to the acute response of oral tissues to therapeutic irradiation. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing these two Trp channels as potential targets for RAP mitigation in human and animal cancer patients.",Included
2856,"Interaction between age of irradiation and age of testing in the disruption of operant performance using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays. Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established.",Included
2862,"Acquisition of radioresistance by IL-6 treatment is caused by suppression of oxidative stress derived from mitochondria after gamma-irradiation. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and is one of the radiation-induced bystander factors. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of acquisition of radioresistance through the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by IL-6. We used a rat glioma cell line (C6) as tumor cells and a rat astrocyte cell line (RNB) as non-tumor cells. Our results showed that the surviving fraction of C6 cells after 6 Gy irradiation was increased by the addition of IL-6, but that this was not the case in RNB cells. In addition, the number of 53BP1 foci in C6 cells at 30 min after gamma-irradiation were decreased by IL-6. Levels of ROS in whole C6 cells, and superoxide in the mitochondria of C6 cells immediately after gamma-irradiation, were reduced by IL-6, but this was not observed in RNB cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 in C6 and RNB cells was inhibited by IL-6 alone. Therefore, it was concluded that IL-6 leads specifically to radioresistance in tumor cells by inhibition of increases in ROS after gamma-irradiation.",Included

Micro-slit-beam radiation therapy (MRT) using synchrotron-generated X-ray beams allows for extremely high-dose irradiation. However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death. The valley doses, influenced by beam spacing and irradiated dose, could represent important survival factors for MRT.",Included

Cerebellum is a vital organ responsible for the motor coordination and recently it has been reported to be involved in cognitive function. Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice. In addition, radiation induced augmentation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and a decline in the total antioxidant capacity in serum; these changes were also ameliorated by melatonin pretreatment. The present results provide evidence supporting the antioxidant and neuroprotective function of melatonin.",Included

PURPOSE: We developed a co-culture system to quantitate the growth and invasion of human malignant gliomas into a background of confluent normal human astrocytes, then used this assay to assess independently the effects of irradiating both cell types on glioma invasion.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled immortalized human astrocytes, human malignant glioma cells, or transformed human astrocytes were focally plated onto a confluent layer of normal human astrocytes, and the invasiveness of EGFP-labeled cells was scored after 96 h. To address the consequences of irradiation on glioma invasion, the invasiveness of irradiated glioma cell lines and irradiated astrocytic backgrounds was assessed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to quantitate the total number of EGFP-labeled cells.RESULTS: Growth in the co-culture assay consistently reflected transformation states of the plated cells. Immortalized, but untransformed human astrocytes failed even to establish growth on confluent normal human astrocytes. In contrast, all malignant human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes demonstrated various degrees of infiltration into the astrocytic bed. Irradiation failed to alter the invasiveness of U87, A172, and U373. A 1-Gy dose slightly reduced the invasiveness of U251 MG by 75% (p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Neuman-Keuls), without reducing total cell numbers. Independently irradiating the human astrocytic bed did not alter the invasiveness of nonirradiated U251, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 reduced U251 invasiveness in the co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: Growth in the co-culture assay reflects the transformation status and provides a useful in vitro model for assessing invasiveness. Human glioma invasiveness in the co-culture model responds variably to single low-dose fractions. MMP activity promotes invasiveness in the co-culture model. Reduced invasiveness in irradiated U251 appears to be mediated by MMP-independent mechanisms.",Included
2921,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms. INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included

PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied.",Included
2950,"Radiation induction of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Ptk-3 in normal rat astrocytes. Radiation-induced gene expression was examined in rat astrocyte cultures using differential display of mRNA via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A 0.3-kb cDNA that was consistently observed in irradiated cultures but not in unirradiated cultures was cloned and sequenced. It was found to be identical to Ptk-3, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene identified recently. The protein encoded by Ptk-3 is a member of a novel class of receptor tyrosine kinases whose extracellular domain contains regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of Ptk-3 was increased in rat astrocytes by 0.5 h after exposure to 10 Gy and remained at the same elevated level for at least 24 h. The maximum increase occurred after 5 Gy. Cloning studies indicated the presence of at least two Ptk-3 mRNA transcripts, which are probably the result of an alternative splicing mechanism. The short isoform lacks a 37-amino acid sequence in the glycine/proline-rich juxtamembrane region. The splicing pattern of the Ptk-3 gene was not altered by radiation. However, the ratios of the longer to the shorter mRNA transcripts differed between adult cortex, neonatal cortex and in vitro astrocyte cultures.",Included

PURPOSE: In this article, we investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the initiation of acute damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain tissue following radiotherapy (RT) for CNS tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy and a closed cranial window technique were used to measure quantitatively BBB permeability to FITC-dextran 4.4-kDa molecules, leukocyte adhesion (Rhodamine-6G) and vessel diameters before and after 20-Gy cranial radiation with and without treatment with anti-TNF. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify astrogliosis post-RT and immunofluorescence was used to visualize protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 post-RT. Recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to elucidate the role of TNF in leukocyte adhesion and vessel diameter.RESULTS: Mice treated with anti-TNF showed significantly lower permeability and leukocyte adhesion at 24 and 48 h post-RT vs. RT-only animals. We observed a significant decrease in arteriole diameters at 48 h post-RT that was inhibited in TNF-treated animals. We also saw a significant increase in activated astrocytes following RT that was significantly lower in the anti-TNF-treated group. In addition, immunofluorescence showed protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 in the cerebral cortex that was inhibited with anti-TNF treatment. Finally, administration of rTNF induced a decrease in arteriole diameter and a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in venules and arterioles.CONCLUSIONS: TNF plays a significant role in acute changes in BBB permeability, leukocyte adhesion, arteriole diameter, and astrocyte activation following cranial radiation. Treatment with anti-TNF protects the brain's microvascular network from the acute damage following RT.",Included

OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated.METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1.RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium.CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1.

A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance. These results will be presented at the meeting.",Included

Prolonged deep space missions to planets and asteroids will expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), a mixture of low-LET ionizing radiations, high-energy protons and high-Z and energy (HZE) particles. Ground-based experiments are used to determine whether this radiation environment will have an effect on the long-term health of astronauts and their ability to complete various tasks during their mission. Emerging data suggest that mission-relevant HZE doses impair several hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive processes in rodents, but that there is substantial interindividual variation in the severity of neurocognitive impairment, ranging from no observable effects to severe impairment. While the majority of studies have established the effect that the most abundant HZE species (<sup>56</sup>Fe) has on neurocognition, some studies suggest that the lighter <sup>48</sup>Ti HZE particles may be equally, if not more, potent at impairing neurocognition. In this study, we assessed the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti had on the spatial memory performance of socially mature male Wistar rats. Acute exposures to mission-relevant doses (<=5 cGy) of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the mean spatial memory performance of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly (P < 0.015) increased the percentage of rats that have severe (Z score >= 2) impairment, i.e., poor performers.

3022,"Chronic pathophysiological changes in normal brain parenchyma raised after radiotherapy can accelerate the recurrence of glioma. INTRODUCTION: Tumor recurrence is a leading cause of cancer mortality. Currently, the standard treatment for glioblastoma is maximal surgical resection and concomitant chemoradiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy. However, this treatment offers a limited benefit, with a median progression-free survival of <7 months and a median overall survival of <15 months. Radiation-induced brain injury occurs in a normal brain following radiotherapy; it is described in terms of acute, early delayed and late delayed injury. The recurrence of glioblastoma usually occurs just around the same time as the early or late delayed phase of radiation injury. Our preliminary investigation has revealed that, at three months after X-ray irradiation, tumor-promoting miRNAs (Mir18a, Mir20a, Mir-92, Mir381, etc.) and cytokines (CCL2, CXCL10, SDF-1, Angpt2, etc.) are significantly up-regulated in the irradiated rat normal brain compared to the non-irradiated one. In the present study, therefore, we hypothesized that the pathophysiological changes in a normal brain parenchyma raised by radiotherapy may engage also in the tumor recurrence after the radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To explore above hypothesis, we transplanted rat glioblastoma cells (F98) into a rat brain to which X-ray had been irradiated in advance. Group 1: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to right cerebral hemisphere. Group 2: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to left cerebral hemisphere. Group 3: Sham irradiation was performed (control). 3 months after irradiation, 1x105 of F98 cells were stereotactically transplanted into the right cerebral hemisphere of each rat. RESULT(S): Rats in group 1 and 2 showed significantly shorter survival than rats in group 3 (p-value: 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Interestingly, there was no significant difference of survival between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.8). Histopathological analysis for the tumors revealed that MIB-1 labeling index was significantly higher in group 1 and 2 than in group 3. CONCLUSION(S): It has been reported that, at the tumor recurrence, a lot of mutations including driver ones has been induced and accumulated through chemoradiotherapy, which can promote the tumor regrowth. However, the proliferation capacity of glioblastoma cells significantly increased, even when they were transplanted into the brain previously irradiated. Furthermore, the fact that tumor growth in the non-irradiated cerebral hemisphere of irradiated rats was also accelerated compared to the control group, suggested that some sort of biofactors may spread from irradiated normal brain cells and can make an impact on tumor cells existing in the opposite brain hemisphere. Thus, the delayed radiation injury in normal brain parenchyma might include paradoxical role on the tumor recurrence not only from inside but also from outside the irradiation field.",Included
3053,"Long-term correlation of the electrocorticogram as a bioindicator of brain exposure to ionizing radiation. Understanding the effects of radiation and its possible influence on the nervous system are of great clinical interest.However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR).A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG).The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity.Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source.The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the alpha-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation.Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR.In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.

Method(s): Murine brain microvascular endothelial cells bEnd. 3 and astrocytes were co-cultured in a Transwell culture plate and then exposed to X-ray at various doses (5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy) and cultured for 24 hours. The group without radiation acted as a control. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2. Result(s): As compared with the control group, the expression of VEGF increased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(1.71 +/- 0.11), (2.03 +/- 0.05), (2.20 +/- 0.06), (2.19 +/- 0.08) vs (1.26 +/- 0.10), P < 0.05] ; the expression of Ang-1 decreased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(2.27 +/- 0.07), (2.28 +/- 0.06), (2.01 +/- 0.05), (1.54 +/- 0.08) vs (2.46 +/- 0.04), P < 0.05]; the expression of Tie-2 decreased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(2.40 +/- 0.10), (2.47 +/- 0.06), (1.05 +/- 0.09), (1.00 +/- 0.08) vs(4.80 +/- 0.07), P < 0.05]; the expression of Ang-2 increased in 5 Gy and 10 Gy dose groups [(2.10 +/- 0.07), (2.43 +/- 0.08) vs (1.69 +/- 0.05), P < 0.05] while decreased in 20 Gy and 30 Gy dose groups [(1.12 +/- 0.10), (1.21 +/- 0.04) vs (1.69 +/- 0.05), P < 0.05].

3078,"Thymoquinone reduces oxidative and nitrosative stress in tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Introduction: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side-effects during and following their treatment. Efforts to decrease toxicity of irradiation to normal tissue, organs and cells have led to a search for cytoprotective agent. Investigations for effective and non-toxic compounds with radioprotective capability led to increasing interest in antioxidant such as thymoquinone (TQ). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of TQ on oxidant/antioxidant systems in the tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of TQ administered by either orogastric tube or intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Result(s): Tongue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the control and sham control groups were significantly increased when compared to the irradiation (IR) group and IR plus TQ groups. Nitric oxide (NO*), peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, xantine oxidase (XO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities significantly increased in the IR group when compared to the control and sham control groups. Conclusion(s): Results show that TQ has the radioprotective, antioxidant effects and free radical scavenging activity. Therapy with antioxidants may lead to the increase in the antioxidant defense system and thus, may decrease the clinical symptoms in radiation therapy.",Included

In a novel approach, neural stem cells were transplanted to ameliorate radiation-induced myelopathy in the spinal cords of rats. A 12-mm section of the cervical spinal cord (T2-C2) of 5-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats was locally irradiated with a single dose of 22 Gy of (60)Co gamma rays. This dose is known to produce myelopathy in all animals within 6 months of irradiation. After irradiation, the animals were subdivided into three groups, and at 90 days after irradiation, neural stem cells or saline (for controls) were injected into the spinal cord, intramedullary, at two sites positioned 6 mm apart on either side of the center of the irradiated length of spinal cord. The injection volume was 2 microl. Group I received a suspension of MHP36 cells, Group II MHP15 cells, and Group III (controls) two injections of 2 microl saline. All rats received 10 mg/kg cyclosporin (10 mg/ml) daily i.p. to produce immunosuppression. All animals that received saline (Group III) developed paralysis within 167 days of irradiation. The paralysis-free survival rates of rats that received transplanted MHP36 and MHP15 cells (Groups I and II) were 36.4% and 32% at 183 days, respectively.

A palmitoyl derivative of ascorbic acid 2-glucoside, 6-palmitoyl ascorbic acid-2-glucoside (PAsAG), which possess good antioxidant properties, is examined for radioprotection in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. PAsAG protected plasmid DNA from gamma-radiation induced damages under in vitro conditions. Presence of 1.6 mM PAsAG inhibited the disappearance of ccc (covalently closed circular) form of plasmid pBR322 with a dose modifying factor of 1.5. Comet assay studies on mouse spleen cells exposed to 6 Gy gamma-radiation (ex vivo) in presence and absence of PAsAG revealed that cellular DNA was effectively protected by this compound from radiation induced damages. Oral administration of 80 mg/kg body weight of PAsAG to mice 1 hour prior to 6 Gy whole body gamma-radiation exposure, efficiently protected cellular DNA in tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and blood, from radiation induced damages as indicated by alkaline comet assay. Oxidative stress in tissues such as liver and brain of mice, following whole body exposure to various doses of gamma-radiation (2-8 Gy), monitored as levels of GSH and peroxidation of lipids, were found considerably reduced when PAsAG was orally administered (80 mg/kg body weight) to the mice one hour prior to the radiation exposure.

3152,"Hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown. The vascular endothelial cell is believed to be a major target cell of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is associated with radiation-induced white matter lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Adult rats were irradiated with graded single doses of 0-22 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 28 weeks after radiation, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry with antialbumin antibody and gamma counting of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Hypoxia was assessed using two 2-nitroimidazole markers, [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-l-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF5), with binding in the rat spinal cord measured using gamma counting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the nonirradiated rat spinal cord, there was no evidence of BSCB disruption or VEGF expression. After 16-22 Gy, there was a dose-dependent increase in albumin staining and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid activity beginning at 16 weeks, consistent with barrier breakdown. A similar dose-dependent increase in white matter astrocytes that showed immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals for VEGF was observed. No increase in VEGF-positive cells was observed in gray matter. By 20 weeks after 20-22 Gy, animals developed white matter necrosis associated with diffuse albumin staining. Irradiated rat spinal cord showed a dose (16-22 Gy)- and time-dependent (16-20 weeks after 22 Gy) increase in [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise accumulation compared to nonirradiated controls. A similar pattern of dose- and time-dependent EF5 immunoreactivity was also observed in white matter. Areas of EF5 expression and VEGF in situ signals colocalized with areas of albumin immunoreactivity. It is concluded that there is a dose-dependent temporal and spatial association of hypoxia, VEGF up-regulation, and radiation-induced BSCB dysfunction. Hypoxia may provide the signal for VEGF up-regulation and perpetuate endothelial permeability damage in the central nervous system after ionizing radiation.",Included

3182,"Collateral damage of radiation to normal tissues: What can the retina tell us?. Purpose : Damage to normal tissue in an irradiated field (normal tissue injury, NTI) is a complication of radiation therapy believed to be caused by microvessel pathology. In the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), vascular pathology was described in uveal melanoma (UM) patients 2 years post-radiation therapy. However, the COMS and other studies used subjective scoring systems, lacked a control group, did not assess neuronal function in detail, and used dosimetry methods simplified for clinical application. Methods : Optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) was used to characterize vascular pathology by vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size, parafoveal density (PVD), and by machine learning-derived density maps. OCT-derived retinal layer thickness and 10-2 visual field testing (VF) were used to quantify corresponding neuronal loss and dysfunction. Patient-specific 3D dosimetry models were constructed to spatially correlate dose to each outcome measure. Measurements were taken in both eyes of 31 UM patients at 0.5-150 mo post-<sup>125</sup>I plaque brachytherapy, and 16 age-matched controls. Data were normalized to the contralateral eye to account for subject variation due to age or systemic disease. Results : Abnormal vessel density, FD, lacunarity, FAZ size, and PVD were observed after 24 mo in 25 out of 31 subjects, whereas only 6 subjects showed any vascular pathology before 24 mo. Visual acuity was the least sensitive indicator of adverse outcome, with only 16% of the entire population showing a visual decline of two or more Snellen lines since diagnosis. Neuronal dysfunction by VF correlated strongly with most measures, especially vessel density, thinning of the superficial retina, and radiation dose (p<0.001). Abnormalities were observed only at doses above 20 Gy. Conclusions : Using a series of quantitative approaches, radiation microvasculopathy was detected starting at 24 mo post-exposure in most patients. Strong correlations between loss of neuronal function, vascular pathology, and dose were observed. Prospective studies will help determine whether vascular pathology precedes neuronal loss.",Included

Very few reports have been published on lifetime risk (LTR) of stroke by blood pressure (BP) group.

We calculated the LTR of stroke for various BP-based groups among 7847 subjects who had not been diagnosed with stroke before the index age of 55 years using cumulative incidence analysis adjusting for competing risks. By 2003, 868 subjects had suffered stroke (512 (58.9%) were women and 542 (62.4%) experienced ischemic stroke). BP was a significant factor in determining risk of stroke for men and women, with distributions of cumulative risk for stroke significantly different across BP groups. The LTR of all-stroke for normotension (systolic BP/diastolic BP < 120/80 mm Hg), prehypertension (120-139/80-89 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (140-159/90-99 mm Hg) and stage 2 hypertension (> 160/100 mm Hg) were 13.8-16.9-25.8-25.8% in men and 16.0-19.9-24.0-30.5% in women, respectively (P < 0.001 among BP groups in both sexes). The estimates did not differ significantly (P = 0.16) between normotensive and prehypertensive subjects.

BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) irradiation has detrimental effects which become evident within hours to few days and after a long latency of months and years. However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE. The severity of the disease may be a consequence of the effect of irradiation on the CNS vascular bed and impaired blood-brain barrier.",Included

OBJECTIVE: The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage is unclear. We examined the effect of early treatment of high-dose dexamethasone on iridium-192-induced damage to normal brain tissue.METHODS: Brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation with iridium-192 was evaluated with sequential magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 11 adult monkeys, with or without short-term high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight/d) was administered intramuscularly to five irradiated animals every 24 hours, beginning 2 days before and ending 7 days after irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after irradiation.RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 week after irradiation revealed marked edema in five nontreated animals. In dexamethasone-treated animals, the volume of edema was reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 1 week and 1 month after irradiation. The volume of ring enhancement in dexamethasone-treated animals was also reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 3 months after the irradiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra revealed that N-acetylaspartate and choline peaks were reduced 1 week after irradiation in both groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time points.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dexamethasone treatment may have an antiedema effect at an early stage and may modify subsequent development of vascular and inflammatory changes but may have no effect of preventing radiation-induced necrosis and the reduction of N-acetylaspartate after brachytherapy.",Included

3279,"Extracranial carotid stenosis after radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a Malaysian study. Background and objectives: Radiation treatment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known to be associated with increased prevalence of carotid stenosis. The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD. Conclusion(s): Extracranial internal carotid artery is the most common site of stenosis following radiotherapy in NPC. This suggests that local trauma from irradiation is the most important factor in predisposition to atherosclerosis following radiation therapy.",Included

Aberrant neovascularization is a pathological hallmark of glioblastoma that correlates with poor clinical outcome. Factors that drive endothelial proliferation, recruitment into the tumor and angiogenesis in the context of radiotherapy are potentially novel therapeutic targets for glioma. Our studies showed high expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in gliomas; analyses of conditioned medium (CM) prepared from shRNA-mediated PAK4-knockdown (PAK4.sh) glioma cells using a human angiogenesis array showed a significant downregulation in key angiogenic factors including Gro-1alpha. Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included
3291,"Cerebromicrovascular dysfunction predicts cognitive decline and gait abnormalities in a mouse model of whole brain irradiation-induced accelerated brain senescence. Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is a mainstream therapy for patients with both identifiable brain metastases and prophylaxis for microscopic malignancies. However, it also promotes accelerated senescence in healthy tissues and leads to progressive cognitive dysfunction in up to 50% of tumor patients surviving long term after treatment, due to gamma-irradiation-induced cerebromicrovascular injury. Moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) via neuronal activity-dependent cerebromicrovascular dilation (functional hyperemia) has a critical role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. To determine whether cognitive decline induced by WBI associates with impaired cerebromicrovascular function, C56BL/6 mice (3 months) subjected to a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) and control mice were compared. Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker-stimulation-induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post-irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post-irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post-irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for early and persisting neurovascular impairment after a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI, which predict early manifestations of cognitive impairment.",Included

It was concluded that following 9.0 Gy <sup>60</sup>Co-gamma irradiation, the serotonin amount significantly decreased in the brain after 1 hr of irradiation, while this amount increased in metabolite which might in our supposition be the result of the metabolising enzyme - the monoaminoxidase activity increase. On the effect of AET given in radioprotective dose-rate, serotonin increased and the amount of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid decreased in the brain. Similar changes to AET were observed following the adding of liponic acid. AET pretreatment prevented the ionizing radiation induced neurotransmitter level changes while liponic acid did not have any effect on the result.",Included
3322,"The Impact of body-only proton radiation on immune-CNS communication. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an established treatment for many hematological disorders including lymphomas and leukemias. Although the prognosis after HSCT has historically been poor, associated with high mortality rates, advances in treatment have led to increases in long-term survival and, consequently, an increased risk for neuropsychological dysfunction. Roughly 40% of all allogeneic HSCTs performed in 2006-2010 involved total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning. Previously, we reported that many TBI-induced changes in splenic phagocytic populations were mitigated by chlorisondamine (CHL), a non-selective nicotinic blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we characterized the effects of body-only proton irradiation (excluding brain) and CHL on the response to a bacterial challenge in 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were given CHL (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and irradiated (0 or 3 Gy) 60-90 min later. Ten days post-irradiation, mice were inoculated with 5e7 CFU of Escherichia coli (i.p.) and euthanized 90-120 min later. We characterized blood and splenic leukocyte population distributions (flow cytometry and hematology), cytokine levels (multiplexed cytokine analysis) and oxidative burst capacity. Radiation decreased virtually all splenic leukocyte counts while increasing oxidative burst capacity. In the blood, radiation decreased lymphocytes but increased innate subsets. Sympathetic blockade did not counter most of these radiation effects. This suggests that the disruptive effect of TBI on brain-immune communication is dependent on direct exposure to the brain.",Included

On missions to other planets, astronauts will be exposed to galactic cosmic rays which are composed of heavy particles (such as 56Fe) and protons. Exposure to these particles can affect the ability of rats to perform a variety of tasks, indicating that there is the possibility that the performance capabilities of astronauts may be affected. Previous research has shown that diets containing blueberry or strawberry extract can ameliorate the deficits produced by irradiation using a ground-based analog for exposure to cosmic rays. Rats were placed on diets containing 2% blueberry or strawberry extract for 2 months prior to exposure to 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe particles. There were no effects on performance of any group of animals when tested on an ascending fixed-ratio operant task 6 months following exposure. When tested 12 months after exposure, the performance of the radiated animals given blueberry extract did not differ from the radiated animals fed the control diet. Both groups performed significantly poorer than the non-irradiated controls. There were no differences between the non-irradiated animals fed control diet and the radiated animals fed the strawberry diet and their performance was significantly better than of the radiated rats fed the blueberry or control diets. The results indicate that diets containing strawberry extract may provide a significant level of radiation protection on exploratory class missions.",Included

Acute disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well recognized after radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed the genetic regulation of acute BBB disruption and its relationship to vascular endothelial cell death in the CNS after irradiation. Adult rats were given graded single doses of X-ray to the cervical spinal cord. At different time intervals after irradiation, the irradiated spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier was assessed using albumin immunohistochemistry, i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. In the rat spinal cord, there was a dose-dependent apoptotic response during the first 24 h after irradiation, and apoptotic cells consisted of both endothelial and glial cells, as described previously (1, 2). A dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell density was observed at 24 h after irradiation. This was associated with a similar dose-dependent disruption in blood-spinal cord barrier as demonstrated by albumin immunohistochemistry. Radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells has been shown to be dependent on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. After a single 50-Gy dose to the cervical spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was a 47.7% reduction in endothelial cell density at 24 h compared with nonirradiated controls. No decrease in endothelial cell density was observed in irradiated ASMase -/- mice. In the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was evidence of albumin immunoreactivity and Evans blue dye staining around microvessels, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake increased at 24 h. Nonirradiated controls and the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase -/- mice demonstrated no evidence of leakage. We conclude that apoptosis of endothelial cells initiates acute BBB disruption in the CNS after irradiation and that acute BBB disruption after irradiation is mediated by the ASMase pathway.",Included

3363,"Long-Term Deficits in Behavior Performances Caused by Low- and High-Linear Energy Transfer Radiation. Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) require a better understanding of the effects of GCR on human health. In particular, little is known about the lasting effects of GCR on the central nervous system (CNS), which may lead to behavior performance deficits. Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses. A significant dose effect was observed on recognition memory and activity levels measured 9 months postirradiation, regardless of radiation source. In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior. In summary, our findings suggest that GCR not only affects the CNS in the short term, but also has lasting damaging effects on the CNS that can cause sustained declines in behavior performance.",Included

3370,"Targeting of externalized alphaB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations. BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction.METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy).RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mug/mL.CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces. CRYAB provides a novel radiation marker for potential vascular targeting in irradiated brain AVMs.",Included
3386,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury. Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it.",Included
3417,"Increase of mtDNA number and its mutant copies in rat brain after exposure to 150 MeV protons. Proton beam therapy is widely used for treating brain tumor. Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.",Included

Therapeutic irradiation of the brain is a common treatment modality for brain tumors, but can lead to impairment of cognitive function. Dendritic spines are sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in spine structure and number are thought to represent a morphological correlate of altered brain functions associated with hippocampal dependent learning and memory. To gain some insight into the temporal and sub region specific cellular changes in the hippocampus following brain irradiation, we investigated the effects of 10 Gy cranial irradiation on dendritic spines in young adult mice. One week or 1 month post irradiation, changes in spine density and morphology in dentate gyrus (DG) granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons were quantified using Golgi staining. Our results showed that in the DG, there were significant reductions in spine density at both 1 week (11.9%) and 1 month (26.9%) after irradiation. In contrast, in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, irradiation resulted in a significant reduction (18.7%) in spine density only at 1 week post irradiation. Analysis of spine morphology showed that irradiation led to significant decreases in the proportion of mushroom spines at both time points in the DG as well as CA1 basal dendrites. The proportions of stubby spines were significantly increased in both the areas at 1 month post irradiation. Irradiation did not alter spine density in the CA1 apical dendrites, but there were significant changes in the proportion of thin and mushroom spines at both time points post irradiation. Although the mechanisms involved are not clear, these findings are the first to show that brain irradiation of young adult animals leads to alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus in a time dependent and region specific manner.",Included

Radiation exposure in combination with other space environmental factors including microgravity, nutritional status, and deconditioning is a concern for long-duration space exploration missions. Astronauts experience altered iron homeostasis due to adaptations to microgravity and an iron-rich food system. Iron intake reaches three to six times the recommended daily allowance due to the use of fortified foods on the International Space Station. Iron is associated with certain optic neuropathies and can potentiate oxidative stress. This study examined the response of eye and vascular tissue to gamma radiation exposure (3 Gy fractionated at 37.5 cGy per day every other day for 8 fractions) in rats fed an adequate-iron diet or a high-iron diet. Twelve-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: adequate-iron diet/no radiation (CON), high-iron diet/no radiation (IRON), adequate-iron diet/radiation (RAD), and high-iron diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals were maintained on the corresponding iron diet for 2 weeks before radiation exposure. As previously published, the high-iron diet resulted in elevated blood and liver iron levels. Dietary iron overload altered the radiation response observed in serum analytes, as evidenced by a significant increase in catalase levels and smaller decrease in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity levels. 8-OHdG immunostaining, showed increased intensity in the retina after radiation exposure. Gene expression profiles of retinal and aortic vascular samples suggested an interaction between the response to radiation and high dietary iron.

While the effects of high dose X-irradiation on mitotically active progenitor cells and remyelination are well-documented, its effects on myelinating oligodendrocytes are less clear, due in part to divergent views on their mitotic capacity. To examine the effect of X-irradiation on oligodendrocytes, the spinal cord of rats was exposed to 40 Gy of X-irradiation and the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the dorsal funiculi at T12 and L1 was determined by in situ hybridization using cRNA-probes for platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFRalpha) (to identify oligodendrocyte progenitors), exon 3b of proteolipid protein (PLP) (to identify mature oligodendrocytes) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). X-irradiation resulted in no change in the number of PLP positive cells and no loss of myelin internodes, but caused an almost complete loss of PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, and a reduction in the number of MOG positive cells to a number similar to that found using the PLP exon 3b probe. Importantly, the number of radiation-sensitive MOG-expressing cells was similar to the number of PDGFRalpha positive cells. To determine if the radiation-sensitive MOG positive cells were the same population as the radiation sensitive PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, MOG and PDGFRalpha-expressing cells were isolated from the adult CNS using antibody coated magnetic beads. Twelve to thirteen percent of MOG positive cells were PDGFRalpha positive and nearly all the PDGFRa isolated cells were MOG and galactocerebroside positive. Double immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of NG2 and MOG on cells in the normal adult rat spinal cord.

Recent evidence suggests that radiation-induced injury to the hippocampi could play an important role in this cognitive decline. As a tool for studying the mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline, we developed a mouse model replicating the results of the recent clinical RTOG 0933 study of hippocampal sparing whole-brain irradiation. We irradiated 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice to a single dose of 10 Gy using either whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) or hippocampal sparing irradiation (HSI). These animals, as well as sham-irradiated controls, were subjected to behavioral/cognitive assessments distinguishing between hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent functions. Irradiation was well tolerated by all animals and only limited cell death of proliferating cells was found within the generative zones. Animals exposed to WBRT showed significant deficits compared to sham-irradiated controls in the hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. In contrast, HSI mice did not perform significantly different from sham-irradiated mice (control group) and performed significantly better when compared to WBRT mice. This is consistent with the results from the RTOG 0933 clinical trial, and as such this animal model could prove a helpful tool for exploring new strategies for mitigating cognitive decline in cancer patients receiving cranial irradiation.",Included

Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of complete resection and postoperative radiotherapy in spinal cord ependymomas. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective study over 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymomas between July 1985 and April 2001. Among them, 13 patients had ependymomas, 6 had myxopapillary ependymomas, and 1 had anaplastic ependymoma. All patients received radical surgery for tumor removal with 13 patients achieving complete resection and 7 incomplete resection due to technical difficulty. Among those with incomplete resection, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed and only one patient with anaplastic ependymoma received surgery alone. The total tumor dose ranged from 50 to 60 Gy. Result(s): Among the 20 patients, 19 patients were alive and showed local control. The median survival time of all patients was 109 months, with 104 months in the complete resection alone group and 135 months in the incomplete resection with postoperative radiotherapy group. One patient with anaplastic ependymoma and no postoperative radiotherapy developed leptomeningeal seeding 9 months after surgery. Salvage therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy maintained normal neurological functions. The patient expired 34 months from the initial diagnosis due to progression of leptomeningeal seeding. Conclusion(s): Complete resection alone in spinal cord ependymoma can achieve excellent local control and survival. Patients should receive complete resection if technically possible. Postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended for complete resection. For incomplete resection, postoperative local radiotherapy is recommended and it can also achieve excellent local control and survival. Local radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy is effective and safe.

Efficacy of the combination treatment was assessed by evaluation of mortality, as well as by histologic examination of the brain, testis, bone marrow, heart and spleen. The combination of relatively low doses of interleukin-1 alpha (700 U) with thymopentin yielded a survival which was nearly that observed with interleukin-1 alpha (1000 U) given alone (about 100%).

We have recently found that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) resulted in significant protection from radiation-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanisms of this cytoprotection include abrogation of radiation-induced accumulation of p53. Here we show that pretreatment of irradiated HT-22 hippocampal-derived neurons with small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3beta SB216763 or SB415286, or with GSK-3beta-specific shRNA resulted in accumulation of the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Knockdown of MDM2 using specific shRNA or chemical inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction prevented the protective changes triggered by GSK-3beta inhibition in irradiated HT-22 neurons and restored radiation cytotoxicity. We found that this could be due to regulation of apoptosis by subcellular localization and interaction of GSK-3beta, p53 and MDM2. These data suggest that the mechanisms of radioprotection by GSK-3beta inhibitors in hippocampal neurons involve regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 accumulation and interactions between GSK-3beta, MDM2 and p53.",Included

We conducted a randomised clinical trial on 211 patients with small-cell lung cancer in complete remission (CR). The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on overall survival. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either PCI (100 patients) or no PCI (111 patients). Each centre was allowed to use its own PCI protocol as long as the total dose was within the range of 24-30 Gy and delivered in less than 3 weeks with fractions of 3 Gy or less. The mean follow-up is 5 years. The survival curves do not differ significantly (P=0.25) between the two groups. The 4-year overall survival rate (95% confidence interval) is 22% [15-32%] in the PCI group versus 16% [10-25%] in the control group. The relative risk of death in the PCI group compared to the control group is 0.84 (95% CI=[0.62-1.13]). The incidence of brain metastasis is lower in the PCI group, but the difference is not statistically significant (P=0.14). The 4-year cumulative rate of brain metastasis is 44% [32-57%] in the PCI group compared to 51% [38-63%] in the control group. In conclusion, in this study, which had to be closed prematurely, no significant difference was found in terms of the incidence of brain metastases nor in survival.

3561,"Terrestrial isopods congregate under a low-level beta-emitter source. Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, but very few experiments have investigated the biological effects of the natural background radiation at very low doses (>10 mGy/yr). We examined whether the background radiation, or radiation of a slightly higher level, has a role in evoking changes in behaviors of terrestrial isopods (woodlice). Upon exposure to a source giving 15 times the background level placed at one end of a box, a significant increase in the number of woodlice gathering under the beta-source was observed with time, as compared with the sham control. Terrestrial isopods have chemoreceptors (the olfactory system) on the terminal segment of their antennae. An additional experiment confirmed the involvement of these antennae in the radiation effect on behavior. After the excision of the antennae, no beta-taxis response was observed. The behavior of the group exposed to the source giving 30 times the background tended to decrease gradually in the area of the source, and the individuals aggregated in the area away from the source. Thus, the olfactory sensor in the antennae may be an important organ involved in the prompt response to radiation exposure, and the discrimination of the radiation field strengths of radioisotopes.",Included

BACKGROUND: Radiation induces time-dependent loss of anterior pituitary function, attributed to damage of the pituitary gland and hypothalamic centres. The development of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in irradiated acromegaly patients is not well defined.OBJECTIVE: Detailed analysis of spontaneous 24-h GH and prolactin (PRL) secretion in relation to other pituitary functions and serum IGF-I concentrations in an attempt to find criteria for GHD in acromegalic patients with a GH response < 3 microg/l during the insulin tolerance test (ITT).DESIGN: Plasma hormone profiles obtained by 10 min sampling for 24 h in postoperatively irradiated acromegalic patients, compared with patients cured by surgery only and matched healthy controls.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: University setting. Fifteen subjects in each group.OUTCOME MEASURES: GH and PRL secretory parameters quantified by deconvolution, cluster, cosinor and approximate entropy (ApEn) analyses, IGF-I concentrations.RESULTS: Irradiation attenuated pulsatile secretion of GH and PRL, but total PRL secretion was unchanged. GH and PRL secretory regularity were diminished. Circadian timing remained intact. Pulsatile GH secretion and IGF-I were correlated (R = 0.30, P = 0.04). Criteria of pulsatile GH secretion = 12 microg/l/24 h and ApEn = 0.800 separated 12 of 15 irradiated patients from all others.CONCLUSION: Irradiated acromegaly patients with a subnormal GH response to ITT have very limited spontaneous GH secretion, with specific attenuation of the size of GH bursts and a highly irregular pattern, but with retained diurnal properties. These patients are thus likely GH-deficient and might benefit from GH replacement.",Included

3576,"Short and long-term evaluation of the impact of proton minibeam radiation therapy on motor, emotional and cognitive functions. Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used methods for cancer treatment. Despite remarkable advancements in RT techniquesthe treatment of radioresistant tumours (i.e. high-grade gliomas) is not yet satisfactory. Finding novel approaches less damaging for normal tissues is of utmost importance. This would make it possible to increase the dose applied to tumours, resulting in an improvement in the cure rate. Along this line, proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel strategy that allows the spatial modulation of the dose, leading to minimal damage to brain structures compared to a high dose (25 Gy in one fraction) of standard proton therapy (PT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pMBRT also preserves important cerebral functions. Comprehensive longitudinal behavioural studies were performed in irradiated (peak dose of 57 Gy in one fraction) and control rats to evaluate the impact of pMBRT on motor function (motor coordination, muscular tonus, and locomotor activity), emotional function (anxiety, fear, motivation, and impulsivity), and cognitive function (learning, memory, temporal processing, and decision making). The evaluations, which were conducted over a period of 10 months, showed no significant motor or emotional dysfunction in pMBRT-irradiated rats compared with control animals. Concerning cognitive functions, similar performance was observed between the groups, although some slight learning delays might be present in some of the tests in the long term after irradiation. This study shows the minimal impact of pMBRT on the normal brain at the functional level.",Included

In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",Included

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of PCI in this population.METHODS: We retrospectively identified completely resected SCLC at the Shanghai Chest Hospital between January 2006 and January 2014.RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (115 patients who received PCI [the PCI-treated cohort] and 234 patients who did not [the non-PCI-treated cohort]) were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the PCI-treated cohort had longer overall survival than the non-PCI-treated cohort among patients with pathologic stage (p-stage) II (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.99, p = 0.047) and p-stage III (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86, p = 0.009) disease. Among patients with p-stage III disease, there was a significantly higher risk for cerebral recurrence from the time of diagnosis in the non-PCI-treated cohort (p = 0.018). With regard to patients with p-stage I disease, neither overall survival benefit (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.68-3.83, p = 0.282) nor risk for cerebral recurrence (p = 0.389) was significant between the PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in the current study support using PCI in patients with p-stage II/III disease but not in patients with p-stage I disease. A relatively lower risk for brain metastases in p-stage I patients might explain the inferior efficacy of PCI in this population.",Included

Cancer survivors were also compared on the basis of treatment intervention, involving chemotherapy (n = 27) versus local therapy through surgery and radiation (n = 30).RESULTS: As a group, the breast cancer survivors scored lower on measures of general cognitive function, working memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function when compared with the normal comparisons. Among the cancer survivors, those who received local therapy scored lower than the other survivors and normal comparisons on measures of verbal learning, visual perception and construction, as well as visual attention and short-term retention.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cognitive outcomes may involve greater age-related deficits among older cancer survivors compared with matched healthy subjects.",Included
2070,"Presynaptic modulation of 5-HT release in the rat septal region. 5-HT released from serotonergic axon terminals in the septal nuclei modulates the activity of septal output neurons (e.g. septohippocampal cholinergic neurons) bearing somatodendritic 5-HT receptors. Therefore, we studied the mechanisms involved in the presynaptic modulation of 5-HT release in the lateral (LS) and medial septum (MS), and the diagonal band of Broca (DB). HPLC analysis showed that tissue concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-HT were highest in DB (DB>MS>LS). Slices prepared from LS, MS and DB regions were preincubated with [(3)H]5-HT, superfused in the presence of 6-nitro-2-(1-piperazinyl)-quinoline (6-nitroquipazine) and electrically stimulated up to three times (first electrical stimulation period (S(1)), S(2), S(3); 360 pulses, 3 Hz, 2 ms, 26-28 mA). In all septal regions the Ca(2+)-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive electrically-evoked overflow of [(3)H] was inhibited by the 5-HT(1B) agonist CP-93,129 and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline tartrate (UK-14,304). Also the mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists (d-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), glycinol(5))-enkephalin (DAMGO) and [trans-(1S,2S(-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzenacetamide hydro-chloride] (U-50,488H), respectively, acted inhibitory (although less potently), whereas the delta-opioid receptor agonist (d-Pen(2), d-Pen(5))-enkephalin (DPDPE), the dopamine D(2) receptor agonist quinpirole and the adenosine A(1) receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine were all ineffective; the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen had weak effects. All inhibitory effects of the agonists were antagonized by the corresponding antagonists (3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-4-hydroxy-N-[4-(4-pyridinyl)phenyl]benzamide dihydrochloride (GR-55,562), idazoxan, naloxone, nor-binaltorphimine), which also significantly enhanced the evoked release of 5-HT at S(1). It is concluded that 5-HT release in septal nuclei of the rat is modulated by presynaptic 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors, as well as by alpha(2)-, mu- and kappa-opioid heteroreceptors. All of these receptors seem to be under a tonic inhibitory influence of the corresponding endogenous agonists and show qualitatively comparable modulatory properties along the dorso-ventral distribution of the 5-HT terminals.",Excluded

HER2-targeted therapies have drastically improved the outcome for breast cancer patients. However, when metastasis to the brain is involved, current strategies fail to hold up to the same promise. Camelid single-domain antibody-fragments (sdAbs) have been demonstrated to possess favorable properties for detecting and treating cancerous lesions in vivo using different radiolabeling methods. Here we evaluate the anti-HER2 sdAb 2Rs15d, coupled to diagnostic gamma- and therapeutic alpha- and beta --emitting radionuclides for the detection and treatment of HER2pos brain lesions in a preclinical setting. 2Rs15d was radiolabeled with 111In, 225Ac and 131I using DTPA- and DOTA-based bifunctional chelators and Sn-precursor of SGMIB respectively and evaluated in orthotopic tumor-bearing athymic nude mice. Therapeutic efficacy as well as systemic toxicity were determined for 131I- and 225Ac-labeled sdAbs and compared to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab in two different HER2pos tumor models. Radiolabeled 2Rs15d showed high and specific tumor uptake in both HER2pos SK-OV-3-Luc-IP1 and HER2pos MDA-MB-231Br brain lesions, whereas radiolabeled trastuzumab was unable to accumulate in intracranial SK-OV-3-Luc-IP1 tumors. Administration of [131I]-2Rs15d and [225Ac]-2Rs15d alone and in combination with trastuzumab showed a significant increase in median survival in 2 tumor models that remained largely unresponsive to trastuzumab treatment alone. Histopathological analysis revealed no significant early toxicity. Radiolabeled sdAbs prove to be promising vehicles for molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy of metastatic lesions in the brain. These data demonstrate the potential of radiolabeled sdAbs as a valuable add-on treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat HER2pos metastatic cancer. Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

2572,"Cumulative genetic damage in hematopoietic stem cells in a patient with a 40-year exposure to alpha particles emitted by thorium dioxide. Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of the long-lived radionuclide, thorium-232, was widely used as a radiographic contrast medium for several decades. Due to the poor excretion of the sol, however, Thorotrast would deposit in the liver, bone marrow and other tissue, and patients would receive alpha-particle irradiation for life. To gauge the cumulative genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells due to chronic exposure to alpha particles, we conducted a multi-end-point evaluation in a 72-year-old man who had been administered a 32-ml bolus of Thorotrast during cerebral angiography performed over 40 years ago in 1950. Peripheral T lymphocytes were cultured to quantify the frequencies and cellular distributions of asymmetrical and symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations in first-division metaphases and micronuclei in cytokinesis-arrested interphase II cells. Aberrations were scored using classical chromosome group analysis methods and chromosome painting techniques. Assays of glycophorin-A (GPA) mutations in red blood cells were also performed to obtain a relative measurement of damage sustained by the erythroid stem cell population. Results revealed that approximately 30% of the lymphocytes in this patient contained one or more chromosome aberrations, the majority of which were of the ""stable"" type. About one-third of the lymphocytes with chromosome damage carried multiple aberrations, suggesting that significant numbers of stem cells survive exposures to alpha-particle radiation that induce complex genomic alterations. Increased frequencies of GPA mutations were observed, demonstrating that genomic damage is also induced in erythroid progenitors. The numbers of micronuclei in lymphocytes were only moderately increased compared to expected values for persons of comparable age, and thus this end point was not useful for quantifying exposure level. Despite the relatively severe burden of somatic cell damage induced by 40 years of internal alpha-particle irradiation, the patient remains surprisingly free of any serious illness.",Excluded

The effect of electromagnetic induction (EMI) on impulse conduction and muscle contraction was studied in isolated sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation of the frog. Electrical stimulation (ES) of the sciatic nerve, at 0.5 Hz with 0.6 V (supramaximal) and 1-ms pulse duration, produced twitch contractions (3.5 +/- 0.4 g tension, mean +/- S.E., n = 8 frogs), which were reduced or blocked by EMI, applied to the nerve via an induction coil, from a d.c. source of 1.5-4 V, at a frequency of 100 min-1, for 2- to 4-min duration. Recovery of the blocked twitches was obtained within 4-5 min, after the cessation of the EMI and washing out the preparation in Ringer solution. The inhibition of the twitch tension by EMI was compared to that produced by an effective concentration of a local anaesthetic, lignocaine (1 microM), which is known to block conduction, by blocking ionic fluxes across the nerve membrane. It is possible that EMI also interferes with the ionic fluxes, and in prolonged duration, may produce changes in the myelin sheath (or the Schwann cells) of the nerve membrane. A comparison of ES with EMI was made, and it was concluded that EMI inhibited electrically induced neuromuscular transmission at the frog neuromuscular junction.",Excluded

We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane matrix absent of tumor cells.RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance. Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with and without radiation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation.",Excluded

Clinical data with RON admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from June 1999 to October 2010 were investigated retrospectively.RESULTS: Thirty-five cases (61 eyes) with RON were analyzed. All cases manifested as sudden binocular or monocular painless vision decrease. In 18 cases (51.4%), symptoms occurred within 36 months after the completion of radiation. In 43 eyes (70.5%), the visual acuity was less than 0.05 and/or with a visual field less than 10 degrees. In 52 eyes which the fundus could be examined, 41 eyes (78.8%) showed a clear boundary of optic papilla, including 6 eyes (14.6%) with normal appearance of optic papilla, 30 eyes (73.2%) with lighter color, 5 eyes (12.2%) with pale optic papilla, and 11 eyes (21.2%) with edematous or hemorrhagic and/or exudative optic papilla. Only 14 eyes showed abnormal visual field examination, mainly manifested as nerve bundle defect scotoma. Seven eyes (50%) manifested as arcuate scotoma, 3 eyes (21.4%) manifested as central scotoma and/or paracentral scotoma, 2 eyes accompanied by blind spot enlargement, 1 eye showed paracentral scotoma and 1 eye with quadrantanopia. Twenty-three eyes received fluorescein angiography (FFA), the major manifestations were low fluorescence at the optic nerve and areas of capillary nonperfusion.

Irradiation induced a clear reduction in the total mean area of the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus but not of the orbital prefrontal cortex, diagonal band and cell layers of the entorhinal and piriform cortex. The gamma-irradiation affected the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs and differentially altered the cell layers of the subfields of the ammonic fields and the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus. In the CA1 ammonic field, dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus, the cellular loss was significant in comparison with control adult rats. The behavioural data indicated that irradiated rats were deeply disturbed in learning the odour-reward association, and substantially impaired in a reversal experiment, but not in the discrimination of the odours per se. The cellular loss in the olfactory bulbs, in the CA1 and in the ventral blade of the gyrus dentatus was positively correlated with the deficit in behavioural performance. The data support the findings that the hippocampal system participates in the odour-reward associations and facilitates the long-term storage of associations after learning is achieved in this olfactory associative task.",Excluded

The incidence of radiation-induced complications, especially radiation optic neuropathy (RON), increases along with prolonging survival time of the patients. This study was to investigate RON in NPC patients after irradiation by visual field and visual evoked potential (VEP) tests. METHOD(S): A total of 28 NPC patients, who underwent conventional external-beam irradiation, received visual field and VEP tests before irradiation, at the end of irradiation, and 5 years after irradiation. RESULT(S): Thirty-four (60.7%) eyes in 21 patients developed pathological visual field; 15 (44.1%) of these 34 eyes occurred within 10-24 months after irradiation. Of the 34 eyes, 8 showed concentric visual field constriction; 6 showed bitemporal hemianopia; 8 showed local photosensitivity descend; 10 showed central or cecocentral scotoma; 2 showed scotoma enlargement. Forty-four (78.6%) eyes in 26 patients appeared VEP abnormity; 24 (54.5%) of these 44 eyes occurred within 14 months after irradiation. In small, medium, and large elements, VEP latencies were significantly longer within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P=0.001); VEP amplitudes were lower within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation without significant difference (P=0.249, P=0.940, and P=0.450). One year after treatment, VEP latency delay maintained in each element (P=0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.001); VEP amplitudes were decreased (P=0.002, P=0.189, P < 0.001).

The effects of ionizing radiation on cell-cycle progression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, and from normal individuals, were studied using DNA flow cytometric analysis. A dose of 100 rad gamma irradiation blocked a proportion of normal and HD cells in G1. A higher radiation dose applied to normal cells increased the number of cells blocked in G1 and significantly delayed cells which were in S at the time of irradiation from reaching G2 DNA content. The reduced cumulative mitotic index in irradiated cultures of normal cells 2 h after irradiation suggests that cells in G2 at the time of irradiation are delayed before entering mitosis. After irradiation HD cells responded similarly to normal cells except that a greater proportion of HD cells were blocked in G1. AT cells do not show the normal delay in progression from G1 to S, or from S to G2 in the first cycle after irradiation. The cumulative mitotic index was reduced in irradiated cells, implying that they are delayed in G2. Thus AT cells did not recognize or respond to signals from damaged DNA which in normal and HD cells caused a proportional block in G1 and an S-phase delay. The only point of arrest in cell-cycle progression in irradiated AT cells was in G2.",Excluded

Materials/Methods: This clinical trial was an IRB-approved, phase 1, single-center, dose-escalation study of BMX-001 in combination with concurrent RT (daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy to a total of 59.4-60 Gy) and TMZ (75 mg/m2 daily X 42 days). We delivered BMX-001 via subcutaneous injection at a loading dose before the start of RT/TMZ and then 2 times/week for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and neurocognition. We defined progression-free survival and overall survival as survival from time of first BMX-001 injection until progression and death, respectively, and calculated both based on Kaplan-Meier analyses. Result(s): There were 15 evaluable subjects in the phase 1 study that received all planned BMX-001 doses. All 15 subjects had GBM (WHO grade IV) with age range of 19 to 80 years. BMX-001 at 28 mg loading dose and 14 mg subsequent dose was the MTD. Sinus tachycardia (grade 3) was the dose-limiting toxicity at 42 mg loading dose (n=1). The only other related grade >= 3 event was hypotension (grade 3, n=1). The most common related toxicity was grade 1 injection site reaction (n=7). Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (95% CI: 8.9, -). Progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% CI: 3.9, 11.4). Overall survival was 23.4 months (95% CI: 11.2, 25.9) with seven GBM patients still alive at the time of this analysis. At time of this analysis, long-term results of neurocognition are pending. Conclusion(s): BMX-001 was safe to administer during concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG. Early results of survival analyses are promising, and long-term neurocognitive protection remains to be determined. Thus, we launched a multi-institutional Phase 2 study with BMX-001 in combination with concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG with key endpoints including overall survival and neurocognition and exploratory endpoints examining white matter integrity and health-related quality of life. Clinical trials are underway also for utilization of BMX-001 with radiation therapy for patients with head and neck cancer and brain metastases. Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3318,"Spatial attention increases high-frequency gamma synchronisation in human medial visual cortex. Visual information processing involves the integration of stimulus and goal-driven information, requiring neuronal communication. Gamma synchronisation is linked to neuronal communication, and is known to be modulated in visual cortex both by stimulus properties and voluntarily-directed attention. Stimulus-driven modulations of gamma activity are particularly associated with early visual areas such as V1, whereas attentional effects are generally localised to higher visual areas such as V4. The absence of a gamma increase in early visual cortex is at odds with robust attentional enhancements found with other measures of neuronal activity in this area. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore the effect of spatial attention on gamma activity in human early visual cortex using a highly effective gamma-inducing stimulus and strong attentional manipulation. In separate blocks, subjects tracked either a parafoveal grating patch that induced gamma activity in contralateral medial visual cortex, or a small line at fixation, effectively attending away from the gamma-inducing grating. Both items were always present, but rotated unpredictably and independently of each other. The rotating grating induced gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex at 30-70. Hz, and in lateral visual cortex at 60-90. Hz, regardless of whether it was attended. Directing spatial attention to the grating increased gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex, but only at 60-90. Hz. These results suggest that the generally found increase in gamma activity by spatial attention can be localised to early visual cortex in humans, and that stimulus and goal-driven modulations may be mediated at different frequencies within the gamma range. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

876,"Effects of low intensity radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on electrical activity in rat hippocampal slices. Slices of rat hippocampus were exposed to 700 MHz continuous wave radiofrequency (RF) fields (25.2-71.0 V m(-1), 5-15 min exposure) in a stripline waveguide. At low field intensities, the predominant effect on the electrically evoked field potential in CA1 was a potentiation of the amplitude of the population spike by up to 20%, but higher intensity fields could produce either increases or decreases of up to 120 and 80%, respectively, in the amplitude of the population spike. To eliminate the possibility of RF-induced artefacts due to the metal stimulating electrode, the effect of RF exposure on spontaneous epileptiform activity induced in CA3 by 4-aminopyridine (50-100 microM) was investigated. Exposure to RF fields (50.0 V m(-1)) reduced or abolished epileptiform bursting in 36% of slices tested. The maximum field intensity used in these experiments, 71.0 V m(-1), was calculated to produce a specific absorption rate (SAR) of between 0.0016 and 0.0044 W kg(-1) in the slices. Measurements with a Luxtron fibreoptic probe confirmed that there was no detectable temperature change (+/- 0.1 degrees C) during a 15 min exposure to this field intensity. Furthermore, imposed temperature changes of up to 1 degrees C failed to mimic the effects of RF exposure. These results suggest that low-intensity RF fields can modulate the excitability of hippocampal tissue in vitro in the absence of gross thermal effects. The changes in excitability may be consistent with reported behavioural effects of RF fields.",Excluded
1681,"Mapping by laser photostimulation of connections between the thalamic reticular and ventral posterior lateral nuclei in the rat. We used laser scanning photostimulation through a focused UV laser of caged glutamate in an in vitro slice preparation through the rat's somatosensory thalamus to study topography and connectivity between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. This enabled us to focally stimulate the soma or dendrites of reticular neurons. We were thus able to confirm and extend previous observations based mainly on neuroanatomical pathway tracing techniques: the projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus have precise topography. The reticular zone, which we refer to as a ""footprint,"" within which photostimulation evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in relay cells, was relatively small and oval, with the long axis being parallel to the border between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. These evoked IPSCs were large, and by using appropriate GABA antagonists, we were able to show both GABA(A) and GABA(B) components. This suggests that photostimulation strongly activated reticular neurons. Finally, we were able to activate a disynaptic relay cell-to-reticular-to- relay cell pathway by evoking IPSCs in relay cells from photostimulation of the region surrounding a recorded relay cell. This, too, suggests strong responses of relay cells, responses strong enough to evoke spiking in their postsynaptic reticular targets. The regions of photostimulation for these disynaptic responses were much larger than the above-mentioned reticular footprints, and this suggests that reticulothalamic axon arbors are less widespread than thalamoreticular arbors, that there is more convergence in thalamoreticular connections than in reticulothalamic connections, or both.",Excluded

2126,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters. BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded
518,"A review of management strategies of malignant gliomas in the elderly population. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults. It is an aggressive primary brain neoplasm, associated with a poor prognosis and median survival of less than 1 year. Approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with malignant gliomas in the United States are over the age of 65. Advancing age and poor performance status are two variables that have found to negatively affect prognosis. When compared to younger patients, not only is the treatment of elderly patients associated with decreased efficacy but also greater toxicity. As a result, elderly patients often receive less aggressive treatment and are excluded from clinical trials. There are many challenges in the treatment of elderly patients with GBM including increased surgical morbidity and mortality as well as increased toxicity to radiation and chemotherapy. As such, the optimal therapy remains unclear and controversial for the elderly malignant glioma population.",Excluded
3583,"Successful endoscopic hemostasis with cryotherapy for a case of refractory esophageal cancer bleeding. Gastrointestinal malignancy bleeding (GIMB) can be a clinical challenge. Options for treatment include surgical resection, radiation, angiography with embolization and endoscopic treatment (ET). Currently there is no standard of care for ET of GIMB. Modalities tried in the past include epinephrine injection, contact thermal devices, argon plasma coagulation (APC) and hemoclip (HC) placement. Cryotherapy (cryo) is a modality used for tumor ablation. It has also been successfully used in treatment of benign bleeding such as radiation proctitis and gastric antral vascular ectasia. There is one case report of cryo use in refractory GIMB leading to short term hemostasis (HS). We present a case of long term HS achieved by cryo in a patient with refractory GIMB. A 51 year old male with a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presented with melena. He was successfully treated with APC and was then referred for external beam radiation to prevent further bleeding. This combination achieved HS for around 8 months after which he presented with recurrent melena. A second attempt at treatment with APC achieved initial hemostasis but bleeding recurred 2 days later. Cryo was offered to him to aid with his dysphagia and possibly hemostasis. On EGD a fungating tumor oozing blood was seen in the distal third of the esophagus. Cryo was performed with 15 second freeze cycles. The patient experienced significant improvement in his dysphagia and resolution of his melena. The patient expired 2 months later due to newly diagnosed brain metastasis without recurrence of his melena. ET of GIMB continues to be a challenge. Multiple modalities can be tried including standard hemostatic maneuvers. Bleeding often recurs and can become refractory. Hemospray has been reported to be effective in these situations but is not available in the United States. Cryo, proven effective in refractory benign bleeding and approved for tumor ablation was used successfully in this patient. Cryo effect at standard application duration is limited to the superficial 5 mm of tissue. In addition to tumor necrosis has the theoretical advantage of forming crystal in the microvasculature leading to thrombosis and possibly hemostasis. This is a case of long term hemostasis achieved by cryotherapy in a patient with refractory tumor bleeding. A prospective study is needed to determine whether these effects can be reproduced in other patients. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

The responses of bioengineered OSNs to diacetyl, isoamyl acetate, and acetic acid are monitored by extracellular recording using the LAPS chip. Features of the recorded extracellular potential firings are analyzed in frequency and time domains. We have shown that bioengineered OSNs can generate specific response signals upon the stimulation of diacetyl, which is the natural ligand of ODR-10. Moreover, different concentrations of diacetyl can elicit different temporal firing patterns in bioengineered OSNs, which permits the concentration detection of specific odorant molecules in solution.",Excluded

Of 97 patients with arteriovenous malformations who underwent follow-up angiography 2 years or more after a single radiosurgical procedure, 72 (74%) had complete obliteration of the vascular malformation. Of 209 patients who underwent radiosurgery for benign tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, or pituitary adenomas) and had radiologic studies after 2 years or more of follow-up, tumor growth control was noted in 200 (96%). Tumor growth was also controlled in 90% of brain metastatic lesions at a median of 7 months after radiosurgery. Of 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia and follow-up for more than 2 months, 14 (70%) were free of pain after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective management strategy for a wide variety of intracranial disorders.

3023,"Modulation of acute coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis in gamma-irradiated rats by transfer of naive lymphocyte subsets before infection. Clinical course, recovery of infectious virus from brain tissue and histopathology of the central nervous system were examined in gamma-irradiated Lewis rats reconstituted by naive lymphocytes before infection with coronavirus MHV-4 (strain JHM). Up to 9 days past infection, no differences were seen between immunologically competent and immuno-deficient animals in terms of onset and progression of neurological disease. However, in the latter animals neurological symptoms were dominated by signs of encephalitis instead of paralytic disease as usually seen in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, despite high titers of infectious virus in the CNS of immunodeficient animals only mild histopathological changes were noticeable. In contrast, infectious virus in the CNS of immunologically competent animals was below the detection limit of the assay. Paralytic disease and tissue destruction were T lymphocyte mediated because gamma-irradiated rats that were reconstituted by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte enriched cells in the absence of B lymphocytes revealed an earlier onset of clinical symptoms and a more rapid deterioration of their clinical state compared to fully competent animals. Whereas in CD4+ T cell reconstituted animals infectious virus was moderately reduced and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory changes in the CNS were focal, in CD8+ T cell reconstituted animals vacuolizing white matter inflammation was diffuse without reduction of infectious virus in brain tissue. From the presented data we conclude that in the acute stage of JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats: (i) tissue destruction and paralytic clinical symptomatology are mainly T cell-mediated; (ii) CD4+ T lymphocytes can directly contribute to reduction of viral load in the brain and (iii) only coordinated action of both, the T and the B cell compartment enables animals to survive the infection and recover from disease.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), but adiposity may mimic symptoms of CAD and reduce the accuracy of diagnostic testing.METHODS: Patients from the PROMISE trial (n=8889) were classified according to body mass index (BMI). We assessed relationships between BMI, physician's preference of functional test, test positivity, and results of invasive coronary angiography (Cath) using logistic regression models.RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of the patients had BMI>=30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 20% had BMI>=35. Providers were more likely to prefer nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over other functional tests as BMI increased. The rate of test positivity with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was not different (10% vs. 12%) in patients with BMI >=35 vs. < 35. The same was true for stress echocardiogram and stress electrocardiogram (positivity 8-13%, P>0.8 for both). In contrast, MPI was significantly more likely to be positive in those with BMI >=35 vs. <35 (18% vs. 13%; P=0.001). The likelihood of obstructive CAD at Cath did not differ with BMI >=35 vs. <35 in patients having CTA (52% vs. 59%, P=0.22), but among MPI patients, Cath positivity was only 29% with BMI >=35 vs. 48% with BMI <35 (P=0.005). Radiation exposure increased with higher BMI in both MPI and CTA groups.CONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of obesity adversely affect the diagnostic yield of MPI more than CTA.

Fanconi anemia (FA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) share common traits such chromosomal instability and proneness to hematological cancers. Both AT and FA cell lines, and patients, are characterized by abnormally high levels of oxidative stress markers. The key FA protein FANCD2 is phosphorylated on Ser 222 by ATM after ionizing radiation (IR), thus allowing normal activation of the S-phase checkpoint, and ATM cells are known to be hypersensitive to oxidative damage. In this work we show that FANCD2 deficient cells have a defective S-phase checkpoint after Hydrogen Peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced oxidative damage. ATM dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 at the S222 residue is necessary for normal S-phase checkpoint activation after oxidative stress, while FANCD2 monoubiquitination at K561 is dispensable. We also show that FANCD2 is not required for base excision repair of 8-oxoG and other DNA lesions (abasic sites, uracils), while treatments that exclusively induce 8-oxoG, but not DNA double strand breaks, fail to activate FANCD2 monoubiquitination, thus indicating that the known accumulation of 8-oxoG in FA cells reflects an overproduction of ROS rather than defective processing of oxidized bases. We conclude that the handling of DNA damage after H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress requires the coordinated action of FANCD2 and ATM.",Excluded

Studies on apoptosis and the influence of UVB radiation on this process have important cognitive aspects. They are a source of information about the interaction between the ultraviolet radiation and the biological material. The purpose of the study was to compare the narrow- and broad-band UVB radiation in terms of its influence on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals. Immunohistochemically, the number of apoptosis cells was counted in the epidermis. In 6 consecutive fields of vision measuring 82.4 mum x 82.4 mum, the number of cells with positive PARP reaction was counted. They were counted in three slices in the control group and in each of the experimental groups. The results underwent statistical analysis. Percentages, arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated. It was proved that UVB radiation leads to enhanced apoptosis in the epidermis. The largest number of apoptotic cells per a surface assessed was observed in the BB-UVB-D experimental group. In this group there were 20 times more apoptotic cells than in the controls. When the number of apoptotic cells was compared between the narrow-band irradiated group and that irradiated with the broad band of UVB, the latter was found to induce about three times more apoptotic cells than the former did. The data obtained after the analysis of the results allowed for a comparative evaluation of the both radiation wavebands, which was also important from the clinical point of view. A full understanding of the complex apoptosis process can contribute to the knowledge about the process of photocarcinogenesis and help find a possible relation between an increased risk of skin carcinogenesis and a distorted apoptotic response.",Excluded
671,"3D conditional generative adversarial networks for high-quality PET image estimation at low dose. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used imaging modality, providing insight into both the biochemical and physiological processes of human body. Usually, a full dose radioactive tracer is required to obtain high-quality PET images for clinical needs. This inevitably raises concerns about potential health hazards. On the other hand, dose reduction may cause the increased noise in the reconstructed PET images, which impacts the image quality to a certain extent. In this paper, in order to reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining the high quality of PET images, we propose a novel method based on 3D conditional generative adversarial networks (3D c-GANs) to estimate the high-quality full-dose PET images from low-dose ones. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) include a generator network and a discriminator network which are trained simultaneously with the goal of one beating the other. Similar to GANs, in the proposed 3D c-GANs, we condition the model on an input low-dose PET image and generate a corresponding output full-dose PET image. Specifically, to render the same underlying information between the low-dose and full-dose PET images, a 3D U-net-like deep architecture which can combine hierarchical features by using skip connection is designed as the generator network to synthesize the full-dose image. In order to guarantee the synthesized PET image to be close to the real one, we take into account of the estimation error loss in addition to the discriminator feedback to train the generator network. Furthermore, a concatenated 3D c-GANs based progressive refinement scheme is also proposed to further improve the quality of estimated images. Validation was done on a real human brain dataset including both the normal subjects and the subjects diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Experimental results show that our proposed 3D c-GANs method outperforms the benchmark methods and achieves much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.",Excluded
3347,"Differential responses to NMDA receptor activation in rat hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells may underlie enhanced pyramidal cell vulnerability. Hippocampal interneurons are generally more resistant than pyramidal cells to excitotoxic insults. Because NMDA receptors play a crucial role in neurodegeneration, we have compared the response to exogenous NMDA in CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons of the stratum oriens using combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording and ratiometric Ca2+ imaging. In voltage-clamp, current-clamp or in nominally Mg2+-free medium, NMDA (10 microM; 3-5 min exposure in the presence of tetrodotoxin) induced a markedly larger inward current and Ca2+ rise in pyramidal cells than in interneurons. Pyramidal cells also showed a more pronounced voltage dependence in their response to NMDA. We hypothesized that this enhanced response to NMDA receptor activation in pyramidal cells could underlie their increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity. Using loss of dye as an indicator of degenerative membrane disruption, interneurons tolerated continuous exposure to a high concentration of NMDA (30 microM) for longer periods than pyramidal cells. This acute neurodegeneration in pyramidal cells was independent of intracellular Ca2+, because high intracellular BAPTA (20 mM) did not prolong survival time. Thus, a plausible explanation for the enhanced sensitivity of pyramidal neurons to excitotoxic insults associated with cerebral ischemia is their greater response to NMDA receptor activation, which may reflect differences in NMDA receptor expression and/or subunit composition.",Excluded

Introduction: It is well known that a significant proportion of newly diagnosed acoustic neuromas (ANs) do not seem to change much on scans. There are less data on what happens to ANs that have initially been shown to grow on scans if left untreated. Radiation treatments can arrest growth of newly diagnosed ANs, but again, data are sparse that look specifically at the subset of ANs that have shown documented growth before radiation treatments. We reviewed our local experience with growing ANs, both what happens if left untreated and the control rate with radiation treatments. Result(s): Of those ANs that have been documented to have grown, 65% continued to grow, 30% stopped growing, and 5% decreased in size. After a mean follow-up of 60 months, 17% of the growing ANs treated with radiation continued to grow, 24% remained stable, and 59% reduced in size. Conclusion(s): There appears to be a subset of ANs that, despite showing initial growth, can stabilize in follow-up, and that radiation treatment does work but much less effectively when only those tumors that have documented prior growth are reviewed. There may be some support for the idea that radiation may be taking credit for what, in part, is the natural history of these tumors.",Excluded

In addition, we compared specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) with the thyroid as a source region over a broader photon energy range than the x- and gamma-rays of I-131. The S and SAF values were calculated for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference voxel phantoms and the University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms by using the Monte Carlo transport method, while the S and SAF values for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) stylized phantoms were obtained from earlier publications. Phantoms in our calculations were for adults of both genders. The 11 target organs and tissues that were selected for the comparison of S values are brain, breast, stomach wall, small intestine wall, colon wall, heart wall, pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, lungs and active marrow for I-131 and thyroid as a source region. The comparisons showed, in general, an underestimation of S values reported for the stylized phantoms compared to the values based on the ICRP voxel and UF hybrid phantoms and relatively good agreement between the S values obtained for the ICRP and UF phantoms. Substantial differences were observed for some organs between the three types of phantoms. For example, the small intestine wall of ICRP male phantom and heart wall of ICRP female phantom showed up to eightfold and fourfold greater S values, respectively, compared to the reported values for the ORNL phantoms. UF male and female phantoms also showed significant differences compared to the ORNL phantom, 4.0-fold greater for the small intestine wall and 3.3-fold greater for the heart wall. In our method, we directly calculated the S values without using the SAFs as commonly done. Hence, we sought to confirm the differences observed in our S values by comparing the SAFs among the phantoms with the thyroid as a source region for selected target organs--small intestine wall, lungs, pancreas and breast--as well as illustrate differences in energy deposition across the energy range (12 photon energies from 0.01 to 4 MeV). Differences were found in the SAFs between phantoms in a similar manner as the differences observed in S values but with larger differences at lower photon energies. To investigate the differences observed in the S and SAF values, the chord length distributions (CLDs) were computed for the selected source--target pairs and compared across the phantoms. As demonstrated by the CLDs, we found that the differences between phantoms in those factors used in internal dosimetry were governed to a significant degree by inter-organ distances which are a function of organ shape as well as organ location.",Excluded
1210,"Acoustic neuroma: potential benefits of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery. BACKGROUND: Single-fraction radiosurgery of acoustic neuromas less than 3 cm in diameter is remarkable for high control but not infrequent incidence of facial and trigeminal neuropathy. Larger tumors treated surgically often result in deafness and facial neuropathy. Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery was used in an effort to maintain effective therapy while minimizing toxicity of treatment.METHODS: The authors described 38 patients with acoustic neuromas, with age range 35-89 years (mean, 60 years). 2,000 cGy in divided weekly doses of 400 or 500 cGy was most commonly prescribed. Tumors > or = 3 cm (n = 16) received the 5 fraction schema. Mean tumor volume was 6.9 cm3, with range from 0.1 to 32.0 cm3.RESULTS: Median clinical follow-up was 27.1 months, while neuroimaging follow-up had a median of 16.3 months. All tumors were controlled. Of 23 tumors smaller than 3 cm, 14 (61%) decreased in size, and 9 showed cessation of growth. Thirteen of 16 (81%) large acoustic neuromas (3-5 cm) diminished in size. The remaining 3 showed cessation of growth. Median radiographic follow-up was 20 months, with a median clinical follow-up of 28 months. No patient developed fifth nerve symptoms after treatment nor did any patient require surgery for treatment failure. Only one had temporary seventh nerve palsy.CONCLUSION: Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery offers a therapeutic approach producing high control rates while avoiding morbidity frequently seen after single-fraction radiosurgery or microsurgery.",Excluded
2651,"Acute impairment of saccadic eye movement is associated with cerebral infarction after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Introduction Cerebral infarction due to delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Damage to the brain in the first 72 hours (""early brain injury"") is likely to play a key pathophysiological role but remains difficult to quantify objectively and noninvasively at the bedside-especially in those patients who do not require sedation or ventilation. Current diagnostic modalities used in routine clinical practice are either invasive, require ionising radiation or contrast or have a high learning curve and user variability. Objectives We sought to determine whether saccadic eye movements are impaired following SAH and whether measurement of saccadic latency (SL) in the acute period post-aneurysm rupture is associated with the likelihood of developing DCI in patients after SAH. Methods 24 male/female patients (mean age 53.32, range 31-70) with World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) grade I and II aneurysmal SAH, treated endovascularly within 72 hours of rupture were recruited. DCI and DCI-related cerebral infarction were defined as per consensus guidelines.1 Saccadometry data was collected at three time points: In the first 72 hours, between days 5 and 10 and at three months post-SAH. Data from 10 healthy age/gender matched controls was collected on one occasion for comparison. Results Age-adjusted median SL in patients was significantly prolonged in the first 72 hours post-SAH when compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 160.7, 95 % CI = (145.6, 179.4)ms, p = 0.0054 f-test). By 3 months post-SAH, there was no significant difference in median SL compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 180.0, 95 % CI = (165.1, 197.8)ms, p = 0.4175 f-test). Patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to DCI had a significantly higher age-adjusted median SL in the first 72 hours than those without infarction (240.6, 95 % CI = (216.7, 270.3)ms v 204.1, 95 % CI = (190.7, 219.5)ms, p = 0.0157 t-test). This difference was more pronounced during days 5-10 post-SAH-the peak incidence for DCI (303.7, 95 % CI = (266.7 352.7)ms v 207.6, 95 % CI = (193.7, 223.6)ms, p < 0.0001 t-test). A binary generalised linear model showed that median SL in the first 72 hours was the only significant predictor of cerebral infarction after SAH. Conclusions This is the first study to use saccadometry to measure eye movements in patients with SAH during the acute period post-rupture. Results show that median saccadic latency in the first 72 hours following SAH is an independent predictor of the risk of developing cerebral infarction due to DCI. Saccadometry may act as a potential objective biomarker of early brain injury to guide the need for intensive care admission and treatment. [Table Presented].",Excluded
388,"Focal, high dose, and fractionated modified stereotactic radiation therapy for lung carcinoma patients: a preliminary experience. BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiation therapy is highly effective in the treatment of small brain metastases, regardless of the histology. This suggests that small extracranial malignancies may be curable with similar radiation therapy. The authors developed a novel treatment unit for administering such therapy.METHODS: The unit consisted of a linear accelerator (linac), an X-ray simulator (X-S), computed tomography (CT), and a table. The gantry axes of the three machines were coaxial and could be matched by rotating the table. Patients were instructed to perform shallow respiration with oxygen. The motion of the tumor was monitored with the X-S. When the motion was slight enough, the table was rotated to the CT. To include all geometric movement on the CT images, each scan was made while the patient was performing shallow respiration. After the CT positioning, the table was rotated to the linac, and non-coplanar treatment was given. Beginning in October 1994, 45 patients with 23 primary or 43 metastatic lung carcinomas were treated. Radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 30-75 gray in 5-15 fractions over 1-3 weeks with or without conventional radiation therapy.RESULTS: The treatment was performed with no or minimal adverse acute symptoms. The daily treatment time was short. During a median follow-up of 11 months, local progression occurred in 2 of 66 lesions. Interstitial changes in the lung were limited.CONCLUSIONS: With this unit and procedure, focal radiation therapy similar to stereotactic radiation therapy is possible for extracranial sites. The preliminary experience appeared safe and promising, and further exploration of this approach is warranted.",Excluded

885,"Regulation of motoneuron excitability via motor endplate acetylcholine receptor activation. Motoneuron populations possess a range of intrinsic excitability that plays an important role in establishing how motor units are recruited. The fact that this range collapses after axotomy and does not recover completely until after reinnervation occurs suggests that muscle innervation is needed to maintain or regulate adult motoneuron excitability, but the nature and identity of underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the results of experiments in which we studied the effects on rat motoneuron excitability produced by manipulations of neuromuscular transmission and compared these with the effects of peripheral nerve axotomy. Inhibition of acetylcholine release from motor terminals for 5-6 d with botulinum toxin produced relatively minor changes in motoneuron excitability compared with the effect of axotomy. In contrast, the blockade of acetylcholine receptors with alpha-bungarotoxin over the same time interval produced changes in motoneuron excitability that were statistically equivalent to axotomy. Muscle fiber recordings showed that low levels of acetylcholine release persisted at motor terminals after botulinum toxin, but endplate currents were completely blocked for at least several hours after daily intramuscular injections of alpha-bungarotoxin. We conclude that the complete but transient blockade of endplate currents underlies the robust axotomy-like effects of alpha-bungarotoxin on motoneuron excitability, and the low level of acetylcholine release that remains after injections of botulinum toxin inhibits axotomy-like changes in motoneurons. The results suggest the existence of a retrograde signaling mechanism located at the motor endplate that enables expression of adult motoneuron excitability and depends on acetylcholine receptor activation for its normal operation.",Excluded

The main objective of this study was to determine whether antioxidative potential of the tissues plays a role in the aging process. Antioxidative potential was ascertained as the susceptibility of tissues to undergo protein oxidation, manifested as protein carbonyls, in response to acute oxidative stress, induced by exposure to x-rays. Brain homogenates from 22-month-old rats were more susceptible to oxidative stress than those from three-month- old rats. Brain was more susceptible to oxidative damage than the heart. A comparison of the susceptibility of brain and heart homogenates in five different species (mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, and pigeon) indicated that maximum life span potential of the species was inversely related to their susceptibility to acute oxidative stress.",Excluded

Multivariable analysis was conducted with use of a Cox proportional hazards model and a stepwise selection algorithm that used p < 0.10 as the criteria for entry and p < 0.05 as retention in the model to identify independent predictors of survival. RESULT(S): Chart records of 478patients (54% of whom were men) diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 41 years (range, 18-83 years).42% of patients had biopsy only, 27% had gross total resection, 6% had near. total resection, and 25% had subtotal resection. 22% of patients were initially treated with radiation, 30% with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 7% with concurrent chemotherapy. Median progression free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 5.1 years and 12.8 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, independent of additional therapy, five factors were identified as independent predictors of OS: age at diagnosis (p = 0.002), Karnofsky performance status (KPS, p < 0.0001), histology (astrocytoma vs. other, p = 0.001), hemispheric location (left or bilateral involvement vs. right, p = 0.02) and gender (male vs. female, p = 0.0003).

1949,"Chronic morphine exposure impairs short-term synaptic depression of geniculo-cortical visual pathway in vivo. Chronic morphine exposure can induce addiction and affect synaptic plasticity, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Two forms of short-term synaptic depression (paired-pulse depression (PPD) and frequency depression) were investigated in vivo in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway of morphine-treated and saline-treated (as control) adult rats. Acute exposure to morphine had no effect on paired-pulse synaptic depression and 10-40 Hz induced frequency synaptic depression. However, chronic morphine exposure reduced markedly the paired-pulse depression and frequency depression at 40 Hz. The effect of chronic morphine exposure on short-term synaptic plasticity in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway was sensitization given that morphine re-exposure further significantly reduced the short-term synaptic depression. Interestingly, the further reduction in short-term synaptic depression due to re-exposure of morphine was recovered to normal (control) levels at 3 to 6h after morphine re-exposure. These findings suggest that chronic morphine treatment could significantly degrade the short-term synaptic plasticity of geniculo-cortical visual pathway.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To expedite improved understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare malignancy of cutaneous neuroendocrine cells that has a 28% 2-year mortality rate.METHODS: This article summarizes a workshop that discussed the state-of-the-art research and priorities for research on MCC and on a new human polyomavirus (ie, MCPyV) recently discovered in 80% of MCC tumors.RESULTS: Normal Merkel cells are widely distributed in the epidermis near the end of nerve axons and may function as mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors. Malignant MCC cells typically stain for cytokeratin 20 as well as for other epithelial and neuroendocrine markers. MCC subtypes, which are based on histology, on cell line growth properties, and on gene expression profiles, have been reported but have not been linked to prognosis. Clinical management has been empiric. MCPyV is clonally integrated at various sites in the human genome of MCC tumors, with truncating mutations in the viral, large T antigen gene that interrupt viral replication. MCPyV seroprevalence may be high, as with previously known human polyomaviruses. MCC risk is increased 11-fold with AIDS and with other cell-mediated immune deficiencies, B-cell neoplasms, and ultraviolet radiation exposure.CONCLUSION: Development and validation of a range quantitative polymerase chain reaction and serologic assays for detection of MCPyV, as well as an infectious clone of the virus, would clarify the fundamental biology, natural history, and epidemiology of the virus, of MCC, and of other diseases. Contingent on standardized histologic diagnosis and staging of MCC, consortia are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant radiation therapy, and salvage therapies; consortia are needed also for epidemiologic studies of MCC etiology.

1639,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry for the Novel SV2A Radiotracer [(18)F]UCB-H: First-in-Human Study. PURPOSE: [(18)F]UCB-H is a novel radiotracer with a high affinity for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein expressed in synaptic vesicles. SV2A is the binding site of levetiracetam, a ""first-in-class"" antiepileptic drug with a distinct but still poorly understood mechanism of action. The objective of this study was to determine the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [(18)F]UCB-H in a human clinical trial and to establish injection limits according to biomedical research guidelines. Additionally, the clinical radiation dosimetry results were compared to estimations in previously published preclinical data.PROCEDURES: Dynamic whole body positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was performed over approximately 110 min on five healthy male volunteers after injection of 144.5 +/- 7.1 MBq (range, 139.1-156.5 MBq) of [(18)F]UCB-H. Major organs were delineated on CT images, and time-activity curves were obtained from co-registered dynamic PET emission scans. The bladder could only be delineated on PET images. Time-integrated activity coefficients were calculated as area under the curve using trapezoidal numerical integration. Urinary excretion data based on PET activities including voiding was also simulated using the dynamic bladder module of OLINDA/EXM. The radiation dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM.RESULTS: The effective dose to the OLINDA/EXM 70-kg standard male was 1.54 x 10(-2) +/- 6.84 x 10(-4) millisieverts (mSv)/MBq, with urinary bladder wall, gallbladder wall, and the liver receiving the highest absorbed dose. The brain, the tracer's main organ of interest, received an absorbed dose of 1.89 x 10(-2) +/- 2.32 x 10(-3) mGy/MBq.CONCLUSIONS: This first human dosimetry study of [(18)F]UCB-H indicated that the tracer shows similar radiation burdens to widely used common clinical tracers. Single injections of at maximum 672 MBq for US practice and 649 MBq for European practice keep radiation exposure below recommended limits. Recently published preclinical dosimetry data extrapolated from mice provided satisfactory prediction of total body and effective dose but showed significant differences in organ absorbed doses compared to human data.",Excluded

Alternating electric fields at an intermediate frequency (100~300 kHz), referred to as tumour-treating fields (TTF), are believed to interrupt the process of mitosis via apoptosis and to act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Although the existence of an antimitotic effect of TTF is widely known, the proposed apoptotic mechanism of TTF on cell function and the efficacy of TTF are controversial issues among medical experts. To resolve these controversial issues, a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of TTF on cell function and the differences between the effects of TTF alone and in combination with other treatment techniques is essential. Here, we report experimental evidence of TTF-induced apoptosis and the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). For these experiments, two human Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87) were treated either with TTF alone or with TTF followed by ionizing radiation (IR). Cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were quantified after the application of TTF, and their percentages were markedly increased when TTF was combined with IR.

We used eight kinds of colored lenses and one lens that reflects blue light. Moreover, we evaluated the relationship between the protective effects of the lens and the transmittance of lens at 464 nm. Lenses of six colors, except for the SY, PN, and reflective coating lenses, strongly decreased the reduction in cell damage induced by blue LED light exposure. The deep yellow lens showed the most protective effect from all the lenses, but the reflective coating lens and pink lens did not show any effects on photoreceptor-derived cell damage. Moreover, these results were correlated with the lens transmittance of blue LED light (464 nm).

In the present study, a particular temporal pattern of the ganglion cells' light response specified as ""dual-peak"" was observed. In the chicken retina (N=15), about 37.5% (174 out of 464) of the ganglion cells showed such special temporal property in response to the onset of light flash. These neurons responded to light stimulus with two successive components: a transient increase of firing rate which lasted for less than 100 ms, and another prolonged light response appeared in about 100 ms after the first transient response. Moreover, our data demonstrated a temporal adaptation process in the later phase of firing activities when repeated flashes were applied. Meanwhile, the earlier phase had a more stable latency in response to the stimulus. Application of picrotoxin could evoke the dual-peak responses in transient ganglion cells.

1390,"A tracking system to calculate patient skin dose in real-time during neurointerventional procedures using a biplane x-ray imaging system. Purpose: Neurovascular interventional procedures using biplane fluoroscopic imaging systems can lead to increased risk of radiation-induced skin injuries. The authors developed a biplane dose tracking system (Biplane-DTS) to calculate the cumulative skin dose distribution from the frontal and lateral x-ray tubes and display it in real-time as a color-coded map on a 3D graphic of the patient for immediate feedback to the physician. The agreement of the calculated values with the dose measured on phantoms was evaluated. Method(s): The Biplane-DTS consists of multiple components including 3D graphic models of the imaging system and patient, an interactive graphical user interface, a data acquisition module to collect geometry and exposure parameters, the computer graphics processing unit, and functions for determining which parts of the patient graphic skin surface are within the beam and for calculating dose. The dose is calculated to individual points on the patient graphic using premeasured calibration files of entrance skin dose per mAs including backscatter; corrections are applied for field area, distance from the focal spot and patient table and pad attenuation when appropriate. The agreement of the calculated patient skin dose and its spatial distribution with measured values was evaluated in 2D and 3D for simulated procedure conditions using a PMMA block phantom and an SK-150 head phantom, respectively. Dose values calculated by the Biplane-DTS were compared to the measurements made on the phantom surface with radiochromic film and a calibrated ionization chamber, which was also used to calibrate the DTS. The agreement with measurements was specifically evaluated with variation in kVp, gantry angle, and field size. Result(s): The dose tracking system that was developed is able to acquire data from the two x-ray gantries on a biplane imaging system and calculate the skin dose for each exposure pulse to those vertices of a patient graphic that are determined to be in the beam. The calculations are done in real-time with a typical graphic update time of 30 ms and an average vertex separation of 3 mm.With appropriate corrections applied, the Biplane-DTS was able to determine the entrance dose within 6% and the spatial distribution of the dose within 4% compared to the measurements with the ionization chamber and film for the SK150 head phantom. The cumulative dose for overlapping fields from both gantries showed similar agreement. Conclusion(s): The Biplane-DTS can provide a good estimate of the peak skin dose and cumulative skin dose distribution during biplane neurointerventional procedures. Real-time display of this information should help the physician manage patient dose to reduce the risk of radiation-induced skin injuries.

A level of tool penetration force during cutting of bones has been the prime concern to surgeons, since it can produce unnecessary mechanical damage to surrounding tissues. Research in this area has been undertaken for many decades to find ways to minimise the cutting force. Cutting of bone with ultrasonic tools is a relatively new technique replacing conventional procedures in neuro-, dental and orthopaedic surgeries, due to its precision and safety. In this article, the level of forces produced during a chisel-like tool penetration in a fresh cortical bone is studied. The obtained force data are analysed for both conventional cutting and ultrasonically assisted cutting. Through a series of experiments, it was demonstrated that the depth of cut and parameters of ultrasonic oscillations affected the level of cutting force, the former being the main factor in both types of cutting. It was found that the tool penetration force was decreased with an increase in the ultrasonic frequency or amplitude and was not affected by the cutting speed. The rise in bone temperature was measured and was found to be insensitive to the level of cutting speed within the range used in this study.",Excluded
1314,"Direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cancer. Introduction Cancer patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality due to thrombosis and bleeding, in addition they may also have pre-existing conditions, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE), for which chronic anticoagulation may be indicated. Historically, warfarin was the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant for stroke prevention in AF patients. Since 2010, the US FDA has approved 4 alternative direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. There is limited literature to support the use of DOACs in cancer patients, but they are being prescribed by medical professionals nonetheless. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the DOACs in cancer patients, to quantify their bleeding risks, and to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from these new medications in comparison to warfarin. Large randomized clinical trials of DOACs compared to warfarin in cancer patients have not been performed. Our aim was to determine the effectiveness and associated risk of DOACs vs. warfarin in a large, real-world population of cancer patients with AF. Methods We identified 532,743 AF patients initiating oral anticoagulant use in 2010-2014 continuously enrolled in MarketScan databases. We selected 41,036 cancer patients with inpatient or outpatient ICD9 code 140.x-172.x and 174.x-209.x (excluded 173.x, non-melanoma skin cancer), and then identified a subset of cancer patients being actively treated at the time of anticoagulant initiation. Active cancer patients were defined by the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or cancer surgery within 6 months prior to the start of anticoagulation. Patients were categorized according to the first anticoagulant prescribed after AF diagnosis. DOAC users were matched with warfarin users by age (+/-3 years), sex, enrollment date (90 days), and anticoagulant initiation date (90 days). Study endpoints, including ischemic stroke, severe bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding), other bleeding (genitourinary bleeding, hemopericardium, hemarthrosis, epistaxis, hemoptysis and unspecified hemorrhage) and VTE were identified using inpatient diagnostic codes, and VTE was additionally identified from 2 outpatient diagnostic codes within the same year. Cox proportional hazards models were used to access the association between type of anticoagulant and outcomes adjusting for high-dimensional propensity score, age, sex, CHA DS -VASc score, and the prevalent outcome. Results The demographic profile of the patients included in the analysis are depicted in Table 1, and Table 2 summarizes the outcomes data. In this analysis there were 6,075 cancer patients with AF who were on DOACs (rivaroxaban 2808, dabigatran 2189, and apixaban 1078) compared to 10,021 on warfarin, with a mean age of 74 years, and a mean follow-up time of 1 year. Approximately 40% of the patients were woman, and breast cancer was the most common cancer in each cohort. We found that for rivaroxaban and dabigatran users, the adjusted hazard ratios for severe bleeding was non significantly different to warfarin users, however, apixaban users had a lower risk of severe bleeding compared to warfarin users, with a hazard ratio 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.79, p=0.01). The risk of other bleeding was lower in dabigatran users compared to warfarin users with a hazard ratio 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.84, p=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke did not differ significantly amongst different anticoagulant users. Each of the DOACs was superior to warfarin in lowering the risk of incident VTE, with p values < 0.0001. Conclusion Based on this analysis the DOACs seem to be well tolerated in cancer patients in regard to the management of atrial fibrillation, with lower or similar rates of bleeding and stroke compared to warfarin users. Importantly, the DOAC users had a significantly lower risk of incident VTE. Given that VTE ev nts contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, prescription of DOACs in place of warfarin can be considered in cancer patients with AF, while we are awaiting prospective data from randomized trials.

1788,"Gamma frequency entrainment attenuates amyloid load and modifies microglia. Changes in gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz) have been observed in several neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta)<sub>1-40</sub> and Abeta <sub>1-42</sub> isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Abeta. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Abeta<sub>1-40</sub> and Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.",Excluded
1926,"Characterization of symmetric complexes of nerve growth factor and the ectodomain of the pan-neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the ligand for two unrelated cellular receptors, TrkA and p75(NTR), and acts as a mediator in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system. Signaling through TrkA kinase domains promotes neuronal survival, whereas activation of the p75(NTR) ""death domains"" induces apoptosis under correct physiological conditions. However, co-expression of these receptors leads to enhanced neuronal survival upon NGF stimulation, possibly through a ternary p75(NTR) x NGF x TrkA complex. We have expressed human p75(NTR) ligand binding domain as a secreted glycosylated protein in Trichoplusia ni cells. Following assembly and purification of soluble p75(NTR) x NGF complexes, mass spectrometry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and solution x-ray scattering measurements are indicative of 2:2 stoichiometry, which implies a symmetric complex. Molecular models of the 2:2 p75(NTR) x NGF complex based on these data are not consistent with the further assembly of either symmetric (2:2:2) or asymmetric (2:2:1) ternary p75(NTR) x NGF x TrkA complexes.",Excluded
1350,"A hot-sensing cold receptor: C-terminal domain determines thermosensation in transient receptor potential channels. Temperature transduction in mammals is possible because of the presence of a set of temperature-dependent transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in dorsal root ganglia neurons and skin cells. Six thermo-TRP channels, all characterized by their unusually high temperature sensitivity (Q10 > 10), have been cloned: TRPV1-4 are heat activated, whereas TRPM8 and TRPA1 are activated by cold. Because of the lack of structural information, the molecular basis for regulation by temperature remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the role of the C-terminal domain of thermo-TRPs and its involvement in thermal activation by using chimeras between the heat receptor TRPV1 and the cold receptor TRPM8, in which the entire C-terminal domain was switched. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain is modular and confers the channel phenotype regarding temperature sensitivity, channel gating kinetics, and PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphophate) modulation. Thus, thermo-TRP channels contain an interchangeable specific region, different from the voltage sensor, which allows them to sense temperature stimuli.",Excluded

The Japanese quail is an excellent model for studying the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement because of its distinct and marked response to changing photoperiods. Studies on this animal have suggested that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is an important centre controlling photoperiodic time measurement. Here we report that expression in the MBH of the gene encoding type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), which catalyses the intracellular deiodination of thyroxine (T4) prohormone to the active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), is induced by light in Japanese quail. Intracerebroventricular administration of T3 mimics the photoperiodic response, whereas the Dio2 inhibitor iopanoic acid prevents gonadal growth. These findings demonstrate that light-induced Dio2 expression in the MBH may be involved in the photoperiodic response of gonads in Japanese quail.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the predictive value of parameters of 3D (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) prior to treatment with radiation/chemotherapy (baseline) and at a postradiation 2-month follow-up (F2mo) in relationship to 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) and overall survival (OS).METHODS: Sixty-four patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) being treated with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy were involved in this study. Evaluated were metabolite indices and metabolite ratios. Logistic linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to evaluate PFS6 and OS, respectively. These analyses were adjusted by age and MR scanner field strength (1.5 T or 3 T). Stepwise regression was performed to determine a subset of the most relevant variables.RESULTS: Associated with shorter PFS6 were a decrease in the ratio of N-acetyl aspartate to choline-containing compounds (NAA/Cho) in the region with a Cho-to-NAA index (CNI) >3 at baseline and an increase of the CNI within elevated CNI regions (>2) at F2mo. Patients with higher normalized lipid and lactate at either time point had significantly worse OS. Patients who had larger volumes with abnormal CNI at F2mo had worse PFS6 and OS.CONCLUSIONS: Our study found more 3D MRSI parameters that predicted PFS6 and OS for patients with GBM than did anatomic, diffusion, or perfusion imaging, which were previously evaluated in the same population of patients.",Excluded

1213,"Location of glioblastoma intersectiing white matter tracts predict patient prognosis and response to bevacizumab prior to therapy. INTRODUCTION: Brain tumors are known to invade healthy brain along white matter tracts. We therefore hypothesized that specific white matter tracts would be associated with poorer prognosis based on their connection to primitive brain regions necessary for essential life functions. We also hypothesized that tumors in these regions treated with bevacizumab would alter patient survival. METHOD(S): 109 subjects with primary GBM tumors were retrospectively included in this study. Voxel-wise survival analyses were performed to test for spatial and treatment dependence of GBM survival prognosis. An intersection analysis was first performed between an enhancing tumor mask and template-space diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived tractography which highlighted voxels with tumor-intersecting white matter tracts. Maps of voxels with these tracts were made for each patient. A voxel-wise Kaplan-Meier test was performed comparing the survival times of patients with and without a tumor-intersecting white matter tract in that voxel. The same analysis was implemented to compare survival of participants with and without bevacizumab. This highlighted regions where survival was effected due to anti-VEGF treatment. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to validate the observed survival differences induced by bevacizumab considering inconsistencies in treatment regimens seen in the patient population. RESULT(S): Glioblastoma patients with tumors intersecting the right anterior thalamic radiation, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral corticospinal tracts, and corpus callosum have decreased survival compared to those with tumors intersecting elsewhere. Patients treated with bevacizumab and who also had tumors intersecting the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, or the thalamic radiations were found to be at a survival advantage when compared to those who did not receive bevacizumab. CONCLUSION(S): Patient prognosis is associated with the location of tumor intersecting WM tracts. A survival advantage was found in tumors intersecting specific WM tracts treated with bevacizumab.",Excluded
2049,"Event-triggered neuroadaptive control for postcapture spacecraft with ultralow-frequency actuator updates. This paper investigates an event-triggered neuroadaptive control approach for postcapture flexible spacecraft with guaranteed prespecified tracking performance in the presence of unknown inertial properties, actuator constraints, and external space perturbations. By employing the minimum-learning parameter technique into the neural proportional integral-like controller, only two adaptive parameters are required to update online, which completely avoids the tedious inertial parameter identifications and dramatically reduces the complexity of controller in the meanwhile. Compared with existing works, the primary advantage of the proposed attitude control approach is that the actuator updates are determined by the prescribed event-based conditions in an aperiodic way rather than a periodic one, which greatly reduces the actuator updates. Finally, two groups of illustrative examples are organized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of attitude stabilization and tracking for the postcapture flexible spacecraft.

1833,"X-ray microtomography (microCT) using phase contrast for the investigation of organic matter. PURPOSE: We show that microtomography (microCT) using synchrotron radiation (SR) can be extended to include X-ray phase contrast, which is two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional attenuation contrast and better suited for the investigation of specimens consisting chiefly of light elements for photon energies ranging at least from 1 to 100 keV.METHOD: Phase contrast is generated by placing the specimen in one of the interfering beams of an X-ray interferometer. With use of 12-keV X-rays, phase projections of the specimen are recorded at 180 or 360 angular settings equally spaced between 0 and 180 degrees. One phase projection consists of four pairs of ""associated"" radiograms in the sense that one is taken with and the other without the specimen in the beam. Between pairs a parallel-sided phase-shifter plate is rotated for changing the relative phase of the two interfering beams by multiples of pi/2 rad. By calculating phase-weighted sums of all associated pairs of radiograms, true phase-shift projections are obtained for all angular settings of the specimen, which are then reconstructed.RESULTS: Three-dimensional images have been obtained from rat cerebrum and rat trigeminal nerve, showing cell structures at 8- to 15-micron spatial resolution. Gray and white matter of cerebrum and neurons in the trigeminal nerve are clearly visible.CONCLUSION: X-ray phase-contrast microCT is becoming a valuable tool for studies of organic samples in medicine and biology.",Excluded

1321,"Irradiation induces glioblastoma cell senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and fatal primary brain tumors in humans. The standard therapy for the treatment of GBM is surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, the frequency of tumor recurrence in GBM patients is very high, and the survival rate remains poor. Delineating the mechanisms of GBM recurrence is essential for therapeutic advances. Here, we demonstrate that irradiation rendered 17-20 % of GBM cells dead, but resulted in 60-80 % of GBM cells growth-arrested with increases in senescence markers, such as senescence-associated beta-galactosidase-positive cells, H3K9me3-positive cells, and p53-p21(CIP1)-positive cells. Moreover, irradiation induced expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) mRNAs and NFkappaB transcriptional activity in GBM cells. Strikingly, compared to injection of non-irradiated GBM cells into immune-deficient mice, the co-injection of irradiated and non-irradiated GBM cells resulted in faster growth of tumors with the histological features of human GBM. Taken together, our findings suggest that the increases in senescent cells and SASP in GBM cells after irradiation is likely one of main reasons for tumor recurrence in post-radiotherapy GBM patients.",Excluded

Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze patient total dose area product (DAP) and neurointerventionalist dose variability in terms of clinical characteristics and the technical parameters of thrombectomies. Local dose reference levels (RL) were derived as the 75th percentile of the patient dose distributions.RESULTS: A total of 179 patients were treated during the study period and included in this study. Local dose RL for thrombectomy was derived for total DAP to 34 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>, cumulative air kerma of 242 mGy and fluoroscopy time of 12 min.

1520,"Bevacizumab: radiation combination produces restricted diffusion on brain MRI. AIMS: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of bevacizumab (BEV) on the diffusion properties of irradiated brain gliomas.MATERIALS & METHODS: Neuroimaging studies and medical records of 44 patients undergoing treatment for cerebral gliomas were reviewed. MRIs were analyzed for presence of restricted diffusion, time to onset, pattern/location, duration of restriction, and persistence of restriction post-treatment with BEV.RESULTS: Patchy confluent areas of diffusion restriction on MRI were found in 12 patients. All 12 patients received radiation therapy followed by BEV therapy. Diffusion restriction appeared 3 to 21 months after onset of radiation and 1 to 6 months after starting BEV therapy, increased in size over time, and persisted up to 23 months while on BEV. Restricted diffusion was observed in areas that received 60 Gy or more of radiation. Areas of restricted diffusion showed low T1 and increased T2 signal intensity, minimal or no contrast enhancement, and low cerebral blood volume. A thin perimeter of susceptibility outlined the restricted areas on susceptibility-weighted images in nine patients (75%). Small focal areas of tumor recurrence within larger regions of restricted diffusion were evident in only four patients (33%). In seven patients (58%) the area of restricted diffusion showed necrosis or radiation change on histology or no metabolic activity on MR spectroscopy or PET.CONCLUSION: Restricted diffusion associated with BEV-treated cerebral gliomas occurs in regions of high-dose radiation and does not indicate high-cellularity of tumor recurrence.",Excluded

3310,"Perception of sniff phase in mouse olfaction. Olfactory systems encode odours by which neurons respond and by when they respond. In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons. Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery to cognitive centres, neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system. However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues. To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses. Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly.",Excluded
1028,"Hypo-fractionated IMRT for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: a 6 year single institutional experience. OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Surgery and radiotherapy constitute the cornerstones for the therapeutic management of GBM. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. Despite the progress in neurosurgery, radiotherapy and oncology, the prognosis still results poor. In order to reduce the long time of standard treatment, maintaining or improving the clinical results, in our institute we have investigated the effects of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy for patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients affected by GBM who had previously undergone surgical resection (total, subtotal or biopsy) were enrolled between October 2005 and December 2011 in a single institutional study of hypo-fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ (6-12 cycles). The most important eligibility criteria were: biopsy-proven GBM, KPS >= 60, age >= 18 years, no previous brain irradiation, informed consensus. Hypo-fractionated IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to 70% isodose. Response to treatment, OS, PFS, toxicity and patterns of recurrence were evaluated, and sex, age, type of surgery, Karnofsky performance status, Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival.RESULTS: All patients have completed the treatment protocol. Median age was 64.5 years (range 41-82 years) with 31 females (46%) and 36 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 38 patients and subtotal in 14 patients; 15 patients underwent only biopsy. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the median OS and PFS were 13.4 and 7.9 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-fractionated radiation therapy can be used for patients with GBM, resulting in favourable overall survival, low rates of toxicity and satisfying QoL.

610,"Lack of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) in layer 2/3 interneurons that receive cannabinoid-sensitive inhibitory inputs. In layer 2/3 of neocortex, brief trains of action potentials in pyramidal neurons (PNs) induce the mobilization of endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), resulting in a depression of GABA release from the terminals of inhibitory interneurons (INs). This depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is mediated by activation of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) on presynaptic terminals of a subset of INs. However, it is not clear whether CB1 receptors are also expressed at synapses between INs, and whether INs can release eCBs in response to depolarization. In the present studies, brain slices containing somatosensory cortex were prepared from 14- to 21-day-old CD-1 mice. Whole cell recordings were obtained from layer 2/3 PNs and from INs classified as regular spiking nonpyramidal, irregular spiking, or fast spiking. For all three classes of INs, the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 suppressed inhibitory synaptic activity, similar to the effect seen in PNs. In addition, trains of action potentials in PNs resulted in significant DSI. In INs, however, DSI was not seen in any cell type, even with prolonged high-frequency spike trains that produced calcium increases comparable to that seen with DSI induction in PNs. In addition, blocking eCB reuptake with AM404, which enhanced DSI in PNs, failed to unmask any DSI in INs. Thus the lack of DSI in INs does not appear to be due to an insufficient increase in intracellular calcium or enhanced reuptake. These results suggest that layer 2/3 INs receive CB1-expressing inhibitory inputs, but that eCBs are not released by these INs.",Excluded

Methods: Radiometabolism was studied in a test-retest setting in six healthy men. After intravenous injection of <sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070, blood samples were drawn over 60 min. Plasma samples were analysed by radio-HPLC for intact tracer and its radioactive metabolites. Metabolite-corrected plasma time-activity curves were used for calculation of pharmacokinetics. In a separate group of 12 healthy men, the whole-body distribution of <sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070 and radiation exposure were investigated by dynamic PET/CT imaging without blood sampling. Purpose: <sup>11</sup>C-labelled 1-[(S)-1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,2]dioxin-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-methoxy-methylpyridin-2-yl)-piperazine (<sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070) is a novel PET tracer for imaging of alpha<inf>2C</inf>-adrenoceptors in the human brain.

360,"A role for oligodendrocytes in the stabilization of optic axon numbers. Differentiated oligodendrocytes express neurite growth inhibitory proteins at a time when these cells are involved in the myelination of recently formed fiber pathways. As the process of myelination follows the completion of neurite outgrowth and is concurrent with the stabilization of fiber numbers in a pathway, we set out to determine whether myelination and fiber tract stability could be causally related. Myelin formation was prevented in the rat retinofugal pathway by x-irradiating the optic nerves during oligodendrocyte proliferation. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis of irradiated optic nerves at P15 showed that oligodendrocytes and myelin were virtually absent. Optic fiber numbers were determined at 2 weeks of age throughout the length of normal and x-irradiated nerves. In some cases, normal or irradiation-treated pups were intraocularly injected with FGF 5 d prior to the fiber count in order to promote neurite outgrowth. Axon counts showed that the total fiber number in a myelin-free optic nerve was 10-30% higher than that of a myelinated nerve. Further, fiber numbers fluctuated by as much as 20% along the length of a myelin-free nerve but were relatively constant throughout the length of a myelinated nerve. Treatment of myelinated nerves with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) had no effect on either total fiber numbers or fiber number fluctuation. Conversely, fiber numbers in myelin-free/FGF-treated optic nerves were as much as 40% higher than in normals. Furthermore, total fiber numbers along the length of these nerves fluctuated by up to 34%. These results indicate that, in the absence of myelination, optic fibers are able to form sprouts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

This phenomenon is called endotoxin tolerance, but the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. The subfornical organ (SFO) rapidly produces proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in response to peripherally injected LPS, and repeated LPS injection attenuates IL-1beta production in the SFO, indicating that the SFO is involved in endotoxin tolerance. The purpose of this study is to investigate features of the IL-1beta source cells in the SFO of LPS-non-tolerant and LPS-tolerant mice.METHODS: We first established the endotoxin-tolerant mouse model by injecting LPS into adult male mice (C57BL/6J). Immunohistochemistry was performed to characterize IL-1beta-expressing cells, which were perivascular macrophages in the SFO. We depleted perivascular macrophages using clodronate liposomes to confirm the contribution of IL-1beta production. To assess the effect of LPS pre-injection on perivascular macrophages, we transferred bone marrow-derived cells obtained from male mice (C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-EGFP)) to male recipient mice (C57BL/6N). Finally, we examined the effect of a second LPS injection on IL-1beta expression in the SFO perivascular macrophages.RESULTS: We report that perivascular macrophages but not parenchymal microglia rapidly produced the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in response to LPS. We found that peripherally injected LPS localized in the SFO perivascular space. Depletion of macrophages by injection of clodronate liposomes attenuated LPS-induced IL-1beta expression in the SFO. When tolerance developed to LPS-induced sickness behavior in mice, the SFO perivascular macrophages ceased producing IL-1beta, although bone marrow-derived perivascular macrophages increased in number in the SFO and peripherally injected LPS reached the SFO perivascular space.CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicate that perivascular macrophages enable the SFO to produce IL-1beta in response to circulating LPS and that its hyporesponsiveness may be the cause of endotoxin tolerance.",Excluded

3454,"Desensitization and Recovery of Crayfish Photoreceptors Upon Delivery of a Light Stimulus. A method to study desensitization and recovery of crayfish photoreceptors is presented. We performed intracellular electrical recordings of photoreceptor cells in isolated eyestalks using the discontinuous single electrode-switched voltage-clamp configuration. First, with a razor blade we made an opening in the dorsal cornea to get access to the retina. Thereafter, we inserted a glass electrode through the opening, and penetrated a cell as reported by the recording of a negative potential. Membrane potential was clamped at the photoreceptor's resting potential and a light-pulse was applied to activate currents. Finally, the two light-flash protocol was employed to measure current desensitization and recovery. The first light-flash triggers, after a lag period, the transduction ionic current, which after reaching a peak amplitude decays towards a desensitized state; the second flash, applied at varying time intervals, assesses the state of the light-activated conductance. To characterize the light-elicited current, three parameters were measured: 1) latency (the time elapsed between light flash delivery and the moment in which current achieves 10% of its maximum value); 2) peak current; and 3) desensitization time constant (exponential time constant of the current decay phase). All parameters are affected by the first pulse. To quantify recovery from desensitization, the ratio p2/p1 was employed versus time between pulses. p1 is the peak current evoked by the first light-pulse, and p2 is the peak current evoked by the second pulse. These data were fitted to a sum of exponential functions. Finally, these measurements were carried out as function of circadian time.",Excluded

514,"Inhibition of IKK/NF-kappaB impairs glioma stem cell function. Glioma, the most frequently occurring primary brain tumor, has a median survival of less than 15 months, despite multimodal treatment combining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. It has been suggested that the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within these tumors are responsible for resistance to treatment and high probability of recurrence. As a result, there is increasing interest in specifically targeting CSCs with new therapies to improve treatment of this disease. NF-kappaB has been implicated in numerous forms of cancer, as its target genes regulate hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Both glioma cell lines and tumor samples show high levels of phosphorylated p65, a marker of NF-kappaB activation. When comparing populations from tumor explants, NF-kappaB is preferentially activated in the CSC subset. We are examining the effects of IKK/NF-kappaB inhibition on both heterogeneous glioma explants and purified (CD133+) CSCs from these explants. Inhibition of NF-kappaB through either genetic or pharmacological means abrogates neurosphere formation, an in vitro measure of stem cell function. Additionally, real-time PCR analysis indicates that inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to a decrease in target genes implicated in glioma CSC biology, such as A20 and IL-6. We have also studied our glioma explants in both subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts to examine the role of NF-kappaB in vivo. We are utilizing microarrays to define the NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression signature in CD133+ cells. Our studies indicate a significant role for the NF-kappaB pathway in the biology of glioma CSCs, with possible parallels in CSCs of other tumor types.",Excluded
534,"Direct correlation between cardiac and striatal <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in de novo Parkinson's disease. Background Even at the early stage of Parkinson's Disease (PD) nuclear medicinetechniques, such as <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT SPECT and <sup>123</sup>I -MIBG scintigraphy, may reveal pathological findings, showing striatum and cardiac reduced uptake, respectively. This information about nigro-striatal and sympathetic cardiac neuronal loss may contribute to the early diagnosis of PD and provide relevant elements for differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndrome. The main limitation to investigate these different neuronal systems, is related to the need of two scans, with two tracers and double radiation exposure for patients. <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA is a dopamine precursor able to evaluate synthetic and storage capacity of dopamine in pre-synaptic terminals. This PET radiopharmaceutical is a sensitive bio-marker to assess nigro-striatal dysfunction and its diagnostic accuracy is comparable to those of <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT. However, <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA has never been validate so far as a biomarker of cardiac sympathetic denervation, despite its cardiac uptake. Our aim is evaluating the association between cardiac and striatal <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in de novo PD, in order to test whether it may be further evaluated as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. Methods Sixteen patients with de novo PD were included in this study. Patients with history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. The patients were given carbidopa (2,5 mg/Kg) orally, and after 60 min, received 185 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA. PET/CT was acquired 90 min after the injection. Cardiac <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA-PET/CT was acquired at the end of brain scan. Automatic segmentation and semiquantification of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA striatal uptake was asses using basal ganglia matching tools package. Regions of interest were drawn over the heart and mediastinum. The ratio between the uptake in the left ventricle and mediastinum (H/M ratio) was recorded for each scan. Results Both in case of putamen (r=0.75, p=0.0009) and caudate (r=0.57, p=0.02) , a significant correlation between the more affected site of striatal uptake and H/M ratio was found. Direct correlation between striatal uptake and H/M ratio was confirmed also in the controlateral site (putamen: r=0.63, p= 0.0096; caudate: r=0.54, p=0.03). No significant inverse correlation was found between UPDRS III and H/M ratio (r=- 0.3630, p= 0.16). Conclusion These findings support the hypothesis that cardiac 18FDOPA uptake may be used as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. If they were confirmed, it will be feasible to image striatal and cardiac pre-synaptic monoaminergic function with a single radiopharmaceutical, dual acquisition, and PET/CT resolution, thus sparing radiation exposure and costs.",Excluded
1221,"Brain ischemia and hypometabolism treated by ozone therapy. BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced brain injury (RBI) and low-perfusion brain syndromes are mediated by ischemia and hypometabolism and have limited treatment options. Ozone therapy as treatment in vascular diseases has been described, but the effects on brain tissue have not been well documented.CASE REPORT: We describe a 75-year-old patient with vascular risk factors and meningioma who was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. 14 months later the patient presented with progressive clinical impairment despite the use of acetylsalicylic acid and corticosteroids. Clinical and imaging evaluations before/after ozone therapy were done by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET); performance status assessment was done using Barthel Index and World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scale (WHO/ECOG Scale). Ozone therapy was performed by autohemotransfusion.RESULTS: Basal images showed brain areas with ischemia and hypometabolism compatible with ischemic processes and/or RBI. There were no changes in MRI or CT scan images following ozone therapy. However, improvements in brain perfusion and metabolism were demonstrable with SPECT and PET; they correlated with clinical development and performance status scales.CONCLUSION: This report supports our previous works about the effect of ozone therapy in cerebral blood flow, and it suggests the use of ozone therapy in ischemic and hypometabolic brain syndromes such as stroke or RBI.",Excluded
124,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery: a new treatment strategy for giant cavernous sinus hemangiomas. OBJECTIVE Cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSHs) are rare benign vascular tumors that arise from the dural venous sinuses lateral to the sella. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as a principal alternative to microresection for small- and medium-sized CSHs. Resection is a reasonable option for large (3-4 cm in diameter) and giant (> 4 cm in diameter) CSHs. However, management of giant CSHs remains a challenge for neurosurgeons because of the high rates of morbidity and even death that stem from uncontrollable and massive hemorrhage during surgery. The authors report here the results of their study on the use of hypofractionated SRS (H-SRS) to treat giant CSH. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2014, 31 patients with a giant CSH (tumor volume > 40 cm<sup>3</sup>, > 4 cm in diameter) treated using CyberKnife radiosurgery were enrolled in a cohort study. Clinical status and targeted reduction of tumor volume were evaluated by means of serial MRI. The diagnosis for 27 patients was determined on the basis of typical imaging features. In 4 patients, the diagnosis of CSH was confirmed histopathologically. The median CSH volume was 64.4 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 40.9-145.3 cm<sup>3</sup>). Three or 4 sessions of CyberKnife radiosurgery were used with a prescription dose based on the intent to cover the entire tumor with a higher dose while ensuring dose limitation to the visual pathways and brainstem. The median marginal dose to the tumor was 21 Gy (range 19.5-21 Gy) in 3 fractions for 11 patients and 22 Gy (range 18-22 Gy) in 4 fractions for 20 patients. RESULTS The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 6-78 months) for all patients. Follow-up MRI scans revealed a median tumor volume reduction of 88.1% (62.3%-99.4%) at last examination compared with the pretreatment volume. Ten patients developed new or aggravated temporary headache and 5 experienced vomiting during the treatment; these acute symptoms were relieved completely after steroid administration. Among the 30 patients with symptoms observed before treatment, 19 achieved complete symptomatic remission, and 11 had partial remission. One patient reported seizures, which were controlled after antiepileptic drug administration. No radiation-induced neurological deficits or delayed complications were reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Hypofractionated SRS was an effective and safe modality for treating giant CSH. Considering the risks involved with microsurgery, it is possible that H-SRS might be able to serve as a definitive primary treatment option for giant CSH.",Excluded

2984,"Effectiveness of lead cap in radiation protection of head in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Aims: Occupational head exposure of radiation was suggested to be associated with brain tumors in interventional cardiologists. The brain is of particular interest, because it is one of the least protected organs during interventional procedures. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the lead cap in radiation protection of the head and compare it with that of a ceiling mounted lead glass screen in a real life setting. Our secondary goal was to test the comfort and convenience of the lead cap when worn on a regular daily basis. Methods and Results: Radiation dose to the operator was recorded by the three dosimeters placed outside the lead cap, inside the cap and outside the apron at the level of trunk for a total of 18 months. Only the lead cap (Burkhart Roentgen International, St Petersburg, Florida, USA) but not the ceiling suspended protective glass screen was used during the first three months of measurement of radiation dose to the head. Later concomitant use of both protection devices was analysed. The dosimeter outside the cap recorded a dose of 2.77 mSv radiation when the ceiling mounted screen was not used during the first 3 months. The doses were 2.4 to 12.5 times higher in comparison to the measurements that were recorded when the ceiling suspended screen was used. However, a remarkable dose of radiation (ranged between 1.16-0.22 mSv) was received by the operators head despite the use of ceiling mounted screen. Yet, even without the protection of the ceiling mounted screen, the dose recorded by the dosimeter inside the lead cap during the first period was <0.1 mSv. As expected, the doses to the head recorded by the dosimeter inside the cap during the next 15 months period were also less than 0.1 mSv with the use of the ceiling mounted screen. Therefore, a cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless of the use of the screen. Conclusion(s): A cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence was much more protective than the mounted screen and reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless the use of the mounted screen. Although being a subjective conclusion, the operator regularly wearing the lead cap reported that the lead cap is reasonably comfortable and offers an acceptable wearing comfort when used on daily practice.",Excluded

Dopamine, the major neurotransmitter depleted in Parkinson disease, can be synthesized and regulated in vivo with a combination of intrastriatal AAV-hAADC gene therapy and administration of the dopamine precursor l-Dopa. When tested in MPTP-lesioned monkeys, this approach resulted in long-term improvement in clinical rating scores, significantly lowered l-Dopa requirements, and a reduction in l-Dopa-induced side effects. Positron emission tomography with [(18)F]FMT confirmed persistent AADC activity, demonstrating for the first time that infusion of AAV vector into primate brain results in at least 6 years of transgene expression.

Purpose/Objective(s): To report on the patterns of failure for medically inoperable early stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) when stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) manages the primary lung tumor. Materials/Methods: We queried our institutional IRB-approved SBRT registry for the period 2004-2014 for any early stage SCLC patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients had biopsy proven disease and were deemed medically inoperable after tumor board review. Routine staging consisted of PET/CT and MRI brain scans only. The treatment model consisted of SBRT to the primary followed by adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (CHT) and then prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). SBRT was delivered employing a stereotactic-specific LINAC with vacuum-bag based immobilization, abdominal compression, and infrared based X-ray positioning system+/- CBCT for image-guidance. Result(s): Of 747 definitively treated cancers over 10 years, 16 (2%) were SCLCs meeting study criteria. Patient characteristics revealed: median KPS was 80 (range 50-90), median age was 69 years (range 45-87), 50% of patients were female, median BMI was 28.2 (range 17.4-41.2). Tumor characteristics revealed: median tumor size was 3.25cm (range1.4-7.2), 4 (25%) tumors were ""central"" (per RTOG 0813 criteria), median PET-SUV<inf>max</inf> was 10.3 (range 2.8-21.1). Median time to SBRT from diagnosis was 2.1 months (range 0.6-6.7). SBRT schedules were: 60 Gy/3 fractions in 25%, 50 Gy/5 fractions in 68.75%, and 30 Gy/1 fractions in 6.25% of cases. Mean follow up was 15 months. Fifteen (94%) received at least 2 cycles CHT, 2 (12.5%) received CHT before SBRT. Nine patients (56%) received PCI and of the 7 (44%) that did not, 1 developed brain metastases prior, 1 refused, and 5 died of non-cancer issues before PCI . There was no grade 3 or higher toxicity; rate of grade 2 or less toxicity was 12.5%.

Purpose : The Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) is characterized by the development of optic disc edema, chorioretinal folds, globe flattening, and/or hyperopic shifts in astronauts during 6-month missions on the International Space Station (ISS). We hypothesize that a weightlessness-induced chronic headward fluid shift within the venous system contributes to these ocular changes. Methods : Astronauts (n=10) were studied before flight (seated and supine posture) and ~150 days into a 6-month mission on the ISS. Ocular and vascular measures included optical coherence tomography (OCT; Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering) assessments of sub-macular choroid thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness (TRT; segmented from Bruch's membrane to the internal limiting membrane); ultrasound-derived internal jugular vein (IJV) cross-sectional area (GE VividQ) and non-invasive IJV pressure (Veinpress); and intraocular pressure (IOP; iCare pro pre-flight and TonoPen in-flight). Repeatedmeasures ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was used to determine the mean change between conditions; data are presented as group mean +/- standard deviation. Results : The mean IJV area increased from 9 +/- 6 mm<sup>2</sup> in the seated position to 83 +/- 27 mm<sup>2</sup> in the supine position on Earth and to 64 +/- 31 mm<sup>2</sup> during spaceflight (P<.001). Similarly, mean IJV pressure increased from 4.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg in the seated position to 16.6 +/- 5.6 mmHg in the supine position on Earth and to 14.4 +/- 5.3 mmHg in-flight (P<.001). No significant changes in sub-macular choroid thickness or TRT were detected during the acute preflight posture change, however after 150 days of weightlessness, choroid thickness increased by 50 +/- 37 mum (P<.05) and TRT increased by 26 +/- 32 mum (P=.05) relative to preflight seated values. IOP remained within a normal range in weightlessness, averaging 15.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg after 150 days of spaceflight, compared to 14.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg and 15 +/- 1.1 mmHg pre-flight in the seated and supine positions, respectively. Conclusions : Although a transient posture-induced venous fluid shift has no effect on choroidal or retinal thickness, a sustained, unrelenting cephalad fluid shift during spaceflight results in increased choroidal and retinal thickness.

To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls.

1236,"Variation in radiation sensitivity and repair kinetics in different parts of the spinal cord. BACKGROUND: The spinal cord, known for its strongly serial character and high sensitivity to radiation even when a small segment is irradiated, is one of the most critical organs at risk to be spared during radiation therapy. To compare the sensitivity of different parts of the spinal cord, data for radiation myelopathy have been used.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, the relative seriality model was fitted to two different datasets of clinical radiation myelitis concerning cervical spinal cord after treating 248 patients for head and neck cancer and thoracic spinal cord after treating 43 patients with lung carcinoma. The maximum likelihood method was applied to fit the clinical data. The model parameters and their 68% confidence intervals were calculated for each dataset. The alpha/beta ratio for the thoracic cord was also was also found to be 0.9 (0-3.0) Gy.RESULTS: The dose-response curve for the more sensitive cervical myelopathy is well described by the parameters D(50)=55.9 (54.8-57.1) Gy, gamma=6.9 (5.0-9.2), s=0.13 (0.07-0.24), whereas the thoracic myelopathy is described by the parameters D(50)=75.5 (70.5-80.8) Gy, gamma=1.1 (0.6-1.6), s=36 (3.3-infinity).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in radiation response between the cervical and thoracic region of spinal cord are thus observed: cervical myelopathy seems to be characterized by medium seriality, while thoracic spinal cord is characterized by a highly serial dose-response. The much steeper dose-response curve for cervical spinal cord myelopathy can be interpreted as a higher number of functional subunits consistent with a higher amount of white matter close to the brain.",Excluded
2608,"SIRT in primary and metastatic liver tumors. Introduction: The liver is one of the most commonly involved organs for metastatic disease. The Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is EU approved since 2002 for treatment of primary or secondary hepatic malignancy. Methods and Results: The procedure exploits a normal physiological process: Healthy liver tissue receives most of its blood supply via the portal vein, while liver tumors receive the majority of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. The microscopic spheres, each approximately 15 to 35mum in diameter, are bonded to yttrium-90 (Y-90), a pure beta emitter with a physical half-life of 64 hours. The microspheres are trapped in the tumor's vascular bed, where they destroy the tumor by reducing its blood supply (embolic effect) and through local radiation damage to the cancer cells' DNA. Inclusion criteria for SIRT are unresectable liver-dominant or liver-only tumors, a life expectancy of more than 12 weeks and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. Exclusion criteria are clinical signs of liver failure (ascites, bilirubin >2.0 mg/ dL in absence of a reversible cause, serum albumin < 3.0 g/dL), a pretreatment scan showing >30 Gy exposure to the lungs or non-correctable shunting to the GI tract. Side effects are fatique, fever, nausea, abdominal pain. Potential complications are radiation gastritis, duodenitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis and radiation induced liver disease. SIRT is used in liver-only or liver-dominant disease in combination with systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) at 1<sup>st</sup>-line, 2nd-line or later. As monotherapy for mCRC and other metastatic disease and cholangiocarcinoma SIRT is used as salvage therapy in chemo-refractory patients. In hepatocellular carcinoma SIRT may potentially down-stage to reach respectability. In metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, irrespective of primary site, whether functional or non-functional, SIRT is used as first-or second-line therapy or in treatment-refractory disease. In these patients due to the much longer life expectancy re-treatment and fractionated SIRT appears possible, and may further extend disease control. Studies suggest earlier use may provide greater benefits. Conclusion(s): SIRT is a well tolerated therapy option for patients with malignant liver tumors not suitable for curative local interventions like surgery or ablation.",Excluded
372,"Brachioradial pruritus and cervical spine manipulation. Brachioradial pruritus (BRP) causes significant morbidity in the majority of patients for whom no effective treatment is found. Chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure has usually been cited as the cause, but nerve damage from cervical spine disease has also been implicated. We report on a small retrospective exploratory study, conducted by questionnaire, of a group of patients who were treated with a specific cervical spine manipulation. Ten of 14 patients reported resolution of symptoms following manipulative treatment. All six patients who had had previous cervical spine disease responded to manipulation, as did half the remaining eight patients who had no previous history of neck symptoms. Although patients with BRP, by definition, share similar symptoms, the aetiology is almost certainly multifactorial. Prospective studies looking for cervical spine disease, as well as assessment of this particular method of cervical spine manipulation as a treatment modality for BRP, should be considered.",Excluded
899,"Depression of involuntary activity in muscles paralyzed by spinal cord injury. Involuntary muscle contractions are common after spinal cord injury (SCI). Increased sensitivity to Ia muscle afferent input may contribute to the development of these spasms. Since tendon vibration results in a period of postactivation depression of the Ia synapse, we sought to determine whether Achilles tendon vibration (80 HZ for 2 s) altered involuntary contractions evoked by superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) stimulation (5 pulses at 300 HZ) in paralyzed leg muscles of subjects with chronic (>1 year) SCI. Responses to SPN stimulation that were conditioned by vibration were reduced in 66% of trials (by 33+/-12% in tibialis anterior and 40+/-16% in soleus). These reductions in electromyographic activity are unlikely to be mediated by changes at the Ia synapse or motoneuron because vibration did not alter the magnitude of the soleus H reflex. The electromyographic reductions may involve long-lasting neuromodulatory effects on spinal inhibitory interneurons or synapses involved in the flexor reflex pathway. Vibration-evoked depression of electromyographic activity may be clinically useful in controlling involuntary muscle contractions after SCI.",Excluded
533,"Phase II clinical study on intraoperative photodynamic therapy with talaporfin sodium and semiconductor laser in patients with malignant brain tumors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was prospective evaluation of the potential efficacy and safety of the intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT) using talaporfin sodium and irradiation with 664-nm semiconductor laser in patients with primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors. METHOD(S): In 27 patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors a single intravenous injection of talaporfin sodium (40 mg/m2) was administered one day before surgical resection of the neoplasm. Next day after completion of the tumor removal the residual lesion and/or resection cavity were irradiated with 664-nmsemiconductor laser with a radiation power density of 150 mW/cm2 and radiation energy density of 27 J/cm2. The procedure was performed at 22-27 hours after drug administration. The study cohort included 22 patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumor. Thirteen of these neoplasms (59%) were newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RESULT(S): Among all 22 patients included into study cohort the 12-month overall survival (OS), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), and 6-months local PFS rates after surgery and PDT were 95.5%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed GBM all these parameters were 100%. Side effects on the skin, which could be attributable to administration of talaporfin sodium, were noted in 7% of patients and included rush (2 cases), blister (1 case), and erythema (1 case). Skin photosensitivity test results were relatively mild and fully disappeared within 15 days after administration of photosensitizer in all patients. CONCLUSION(S): Intraoperative PDT using talaporfin sodium and semiconductor laser may be considered as potentially effective and sufficiently safe option for adjuvant management of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors. Its inclusion in combined treatment strategy may have a positive impact on OS and local tumor control, particularly in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.",Excluded
2,"Patient's Skeletal Muscle Radiation Attenuation and Sarcopenic Obesity are Associated with Postoperative Morbidity after Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation and Resection for Rectal Cancer. BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the relation between skeletal muscle measurements (muscle mass, radiation attenuation, and sarcopenic obesity), postoperative morbidity, and survival after treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.METHODS: This explorative retrospective study identified 99 consecutive patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery between January 2007 and May 2012. Skeletal muscle mass was measured as total psoas area and total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) at 3 anatomical levels using the patient's preoperative computed tomography scan. Radiation attenuation was measured using corresponding mean Hounsfield units for TAMA. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as body mass index above 25 kg.m-2 combined with skeletal muscle mass index below the sex-specific median. Postoperative complications were graded by using the -Clavien-Dindo classification.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (25.3%) developed a grade 3-5 complication. Lower radiation attenuation was independently associated with overall (p = 0.003) and grade 3-5 complications (p = 0.002). Sarcopenic obesity was associated with overall complications (all p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle measurements and survival were not significantly related.CONCLUSION: Radiation attenuation was associated with overall and grade 3-5 postoperative morbidity after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and non-laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with overall complications.",Excluded
2343,"A common sense approach to radiotherapy planning of glioblastoma multiforme situated in the temporal lobe. PURPOSE: Irradiation remains the cornerstone of management for glioblastoma multiforme. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer advocate encompassing the primary tumor plus a 2-cm margin in the high-dose volume. One shortcoming of this approach is the exposure of critical structures to radiation doses that could exceed organ tolerance. We investigated whether the temporal bone (rather than the aforementioned 2-cm radius) would serve as a barrier to tumor spread when regarded as the anterior margin for temporal lobe lesions. We hypothesized that by using the temporal bone as the radiation field margin, toxicity could be reduced without compromising tumor control.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2003 and 2007, 342 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme were treated with surgery and primary irradiation at our institution. Of these 342 patients, 50 had lesions confined to the temporal lobe. The clinical target volume included the primary lesion, the area of edema when present, and a 2-cm margin, except in the direction of the temporal bone.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 40 were available for evaluation. At a median follow-up of 12.95 months, 8 patients had not yet shown signs of tumor progression, 24 had local failure, 7 had distant or mixed (local plus distant) failure, and only 1 patient had failure in the infratemporal fossa.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study have demonstrated an acceptable level of recurrence when the temporal bone, rather than a 2-cm margin, is used as the anterior border of the clinical target volume. The strategy we have proposed achieves tumor control and respects optic tolerance without resorting to complex, expensive approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy.",Excluded

1989,"Exploring the cost-effectiveness of thoracic radiation therapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): The recently reported Chest Radiotherapy Extensive Stage Trial (CREST) showed that administering thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) after a response to first-line chemotherapy improves 2-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival, without an increase in adverse events, in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding TRT to chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ESSCLC patients. Materials/Methods: Using a partitioned survival model, a cost-utility analysis was performed to compare strategies of TRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions via 3-D conformal RT) plus PCI versus PCI alone. The time horizon was limited to 24 months, the median follow-up of CREST. OS was partitioned into three mutually exclusive health states: alive with no progression (ANP), alive with progression (AWP), and dead. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was based on the empirical survival functions reported in CREST. Institutional treatment costs from a payer perspective were used while utilities were derived from the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed plausible ranges of uncertainty in key variables including costs, utilities, and the TRT survival benefit. Result(s): In the base-case analysis, adding TRT resulted in a $4,066 cost increase and a gain of 0.06 QALYs (0.09 LYs), yielding an ICER of $66,901/QALY ($46,568/LY). Extending the time horizon to 30 months, assuming: (1), a persistent survival benefit and (2), a declining benefit to a hazard ratio of 1, resulted in ICERs of $93,204 and $111,916/QALY respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ICER to be most sensitive to variations in ANP and AWP health state costs. The ICER was moderately sensitive to variations in TRT costs and the utility for the ANP state, but less sensitive to changes in the utility for the AWP state. Conclusion(s): Adding TRT to chemotherapy in ES-SCLC patients was found to be cost effective using commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, with an ICER lower than those of many systemic treatments for metastatic disease. Since the incremental survival benefit of TRT beyond 24 months is small, its cost-effectiveness is expected to decrease if costs remain constant.",Excluded

If the bandwidth of a sound is varied while maintaining the overall intensity, the loudness remains constant as long as the bandwidth is less than the critical bandwidth. If the bandwidth is increased beyond the critical bandwidth, the loudness increases with increasing bandwidth.

Intrinsic properties and rotation-evoked responses of trochlear motoneurons were investigated in the turtle using an in vitro preparation consisting of the brain stem with attached temporal bones that retain functional semicircular canals. Motoneurons were divided into two classes based on intrinsic properties. The first class exhibited higher impedance (123.0 +/- 11.0 MOmega), wider spikes (0.99 +/- 0.05 ms), a single spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP), little or no spike frequency adaptation (SFA), and anomalous rectification, characterized by an initial ""sag"" in membrane potential in response to hyperpolarizing current injection. The second class exhibited lower impedance (21.8 +/- 2.5 MOmega), narrower spikes (0.74 +/- 0.03 ms), a double AHP, substantial SFA, and little or no rectification. Vestibular responses were evoked by horizontal sinusoidal rotation (1/12-1/3 Hz; peak velocity: 30-100 degrees /s). Spiking in higher-impedance cells was recruited earlier in the response and exhibited a more limited dynamic range relative to that of lower impedance cells. Spiking evoked by injecting depolarizing current during rotation was blocked during contraversive motion and was consistent with a shunting inhibition. No morphological features were identified in neurobiotin-filled cells that correlated with the two physiological classes. Recovered motoneurons were multipolar but exhibited a less-complex dendritic morphology than ocular motoneurons of similarly sized mammals. The two physiologically defined cell classes have homologues in other vertebrates, suggesting that intrinsic membrane properties play an important role in oculomotor processing.",Excluded

1467,"Diffusion tensor imaging contributes to differentiate Richardson's syndrome from progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism. Objective: Abnormal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of the superior cerebellar peduncles were reported in patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS). A few studies showed that PSP-RS patients had DTI alterations also in the corpus callosum, internal capsulae, and long-range white matter (WM) tracts. However, most of the previous studies did not include the atypical clinical presentations of PSP. The aims of this study were to investigate the regional distribution of WM damage in patients with PSP-RS and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) using DTI, and quantify the DTI classificatory ability in diagnosing PSP syndromes, when used in combination with infratentorial volumetry. Method(s): In 37 PSP (21 PSP-RS, 16 PSP-P) and 42 controls, tractbased spatial statistics was applied. DTI metrics were derived from supratentorial, thalamic, and infratentorial tracts. Brain atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, frontoparietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P. When MRPI and DTI measures were combined, the discriminatory power increased from 0.92 to 0.98 for PSP-RS vs. controls, from 0.70 to 0.82 for PSP-P vs. controls, and from 0.77 to 0.84 for PSP-RS vs. PSP-P. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of GM and WM alterations occur in PSP-RS and PSP-P.

We established an in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay of human tumours for estimation of the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis (the dividing fraction, DF), the time for the number of nuclei to double and the radiosensitivity in terms of the micronucleus frequency, based on a concept described previously. Under certain conditions, the nuclear number doubling time (NNDT) was considered to represent the potential doubling time. Tumour specimens obtained at surgery were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and were directly cultured in the presence of cytochalasin B with or without irradiation. At various intervals, the percentage of multinucleate cells (the plateau value represented the DF), the average number of nuclei per cell and the number of micronuclei in binucleate cells were determined. DF and NNDT values were obtained in 58 of the 73 tumours investigated, and the micronucleus frequency was obtained in 54 of these 58 tumours. The DF ranged from 4.1% to 71% and the NNDT ranged from 3.1 to 83 days. A DF > or = 20% was associated with a higher recurrence rate in patients undergoing curative operation. A correlation was found between the NNDT and the time to relapse in patients with recurrent disease. The average number of micronuclei per binucleate cell at 2 Gy of irradiation (after subtraction of the value at 0 Gy) ranged from 0.052 to 0.35. Tumours which produced more micronuclei after irradiation showed a better response to radiotherapy.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) stimulates reactive astrogliosis and the infiltration of macrophages, which interact with each other at the injured area. We previously found Photobiomodulation (PBM) significantly decreases the number of M1 macrophages at the injured area of SCI. But the exact nature of the astrocyte response following PBM and relationship with the macrophage have not been explored in detail. In this study, a BALB/c mice model with standardized bilateral spinal cord compression and a macrophage-astrocyte co-culture model were applied to study effects of PBM on astrocytes. Results showed that PBM inhibit the expression of the astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the secretion of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) in the para-epicenter area, decrease the number of M1 macrophage in vivo. The in vitro experiments indicated M1 macrophages promote the cell viability of astrocytes and the expression of CSPG. However, PBM significantly inhibited the expression of GFAP, decreased activation of astrocyte, and downregulated the expression of CSPG by regulating M1 macrophages.

Method(s): A head phantom was used as a target object. Axial CT and threedimensional CT angiograms were obtained at various effective milliampere-second values (49-350 mAs) and tube potentials (80-140 kVp) with a 64-row detector CT scanner. Lens doses were measured using a planar silicon pin-photodiode system. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and streak artefacts on the axial CT angiograms were evaluated and the image quality of the three-dimensional CT angiograms was assessed using entropy analysis. Result(s): Lens doses increased with tube potential and effective milliampere-seconds. From the evaluation of SNR and streak artefacts on axial CT angiograms, we found that the image quality was improved by setting the tube potential at 100 kVp. However, there was little visual difference in the image quality for 100 kVp between 252 (effective value recommended by the manufacturer) and 350 mAs (maximum effective value). In the entropy analysis of the image quality of three-dimensional CT angiograms, the mutual information (information gain) per lens dose was largest at 80 kVp and 252 mAs.

PURPOSE: To investigate the functional protective effect of a synthetic (dimethylthiourea, DMTU) and a natural antioxidant (Ginkgo biloba extract, EGb 761) against light-induced retinal degeneration.METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed for 24 hours to 1700-lux light after treatment with DMTU or EGb 761. Electroretinograms were recorded before and on day (D)1, D3, D8, D15, D22, and D29 after light exposure. The b-wave amplitude was plotted against log L (ganzfeld luminance), providing the b-wave sensitivity curve. The Naka-Rushton function fitted to the sensitivity curve enabled derivation of the parameters Bmax (saturated amplitude) and K (luminance-inducing Bmax/2). In addition, rats from each group were killed for retinal morphometric analyses.RESULTS: In the untreated group, light exposure caused collapse of the b-wave sensitivity curves. Bmax was reduced by 51% at D1 without subsequent recovery. K increased temporarily, reverting to normal values 8 days later. The outer nuclear layer thicknesses decreased markedly in the superior retina. In the treated groups, light exposure had a weaker effect on sensitivity curves. The values of Bmax were not significantly different from those in the unexposed-untreated group, although K increased temporarily.

UNLABELLED: Serotonin 4 receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 [5HT4R]) hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach to multiple brain disorders, including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. In vivo imaging of these receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery. In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain.METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed.RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698 avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately 10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight. SB204070 blocked the radiotracer binding in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Data indicate that (18)F-MNI698 is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain, and human studies are warranted based on these study results.",Excluded
1609,"Effect of cell-mediated immune factors on the replication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive mutant of vaccinia virus. Studies of the in vivo multiplication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive strain of vaccinia virus (ts2) indicated that temperature sensitivity alone could not account for the attenuation. Immunodepressive treatment of intracerebrally inoculated mice had a dramatic stimulatory effect on the multiplication of the attenuated strain and suggested that establishment of ts2 infection in the mice was hindered by host defense mechanisms mediated by cellular elements. Experiments carried out in vitro with the 51Cr release assay showed that cells infected with the ts2 mutant represented more susceptible targets to the cytotoxic action of immune spleen cells than cells infected with the parent vaccinia strain. Moreover, it appeared that ts2 replication, compared with wild-type replication in vitro, was more inhibited by the immune spleen cells. Although this work did not evaluate the role of specifically sensitized lymphocytes within the lesions, indirect evidence suggests that lymphocytes could cause a more effective halt in ts2 virus multiplication than in wild-type multiplication.",Excluded
2390,"Technical advances in x-ray microbeam radiation therapy. In the last 25 years microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional radiation therapy at large, third generation synchrotrons. In MRT, a multi-slit collimator modulates a kilovoltage x-ray beam on a micrometer scale, creating peak dose areas with unconventionally high doses of several hundred Grays separated by low dose valley regions, where the dose remains well below the tissue tolerance level. Pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that such beam geometries lead to substantially reduced damage to normal tissue at equal tumour control rates and hence drastically increase the therapeutic window. Although the mechanisms behind MRT are still to be elucidated, previous studies indicate that immune response, tumour microenvironment, and the microvasculature may play a crucial role. Beyond tumour therapy, MRT has also been suggested as a microsurgical tool in neurological disorders and as a primer for drug delivery. The physical properties of MRT demand innovative medical physics and engineering solutions for safe treatment delivery. This article reviews technical developments in MRT and discusses existing solutions for dosimetric validation, reliable treatment planning and safety. Instrumentation at synchrotron facilities, including beam production, collimators and patient positioning systems, is also discussed. Specific solutions reviewed in this article include: dosimetry techniques that can cope with high spatial resolution, low photon energies and extremely high dose rates of up to 15 000 Gy s<sup>-1</sup>, dose calculation algorithms-apart from pure Monte Carlo Simulations-to overcome the challenge of small voxel sizes and a wide dynamic dose-range, and the use of dose-enhancing nanoparticles to combat the limited penetrability of a kilovoltage energy spectrum. Finally, concepts for alternative compact microbeam sources are presented, such as inverse Compton scattering set-ups and carbon nanotube x-ray tubes, that may facilitate the transfer of MRT into a hospital-based clinical environment. Intensive research in recent years has resulted in practical solutions to most of the technical challenges in MRT. Treatment planning, dosimetry and patient safety systems at synchrotrons have matured to a point that first veterinary and clinical studies in MRT are within reach. Should these studies confirm the promising results of pre-clinical studies, the authors are confident that MRT will become an effective new radiotherapy option for certain patients.",Excluded

1362,"GSM mobile phone radiation suppresses brain glucose metabolism. We investigated the effects of mobile phone radiation on cerebral glucose metabolism using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) with the (18)F-deoxyglucose (FDG) tracer. A long half-life (109 minutes) of the (18)F isotope allowed a long, natural exposure condition outside the PET scanner. Thirteen young right-handed male subjects were exposed to a pulse-modulated 902.4 MHz Global System for Mobile Communications signal for 33 minutes, while performing a simple visual vigilance task. Temperature was also measured in the head region (forehead, eyes, cheeks, ear canals) during exposure. (18)F-deoxyglucose PET images acquired after the exposure showed that relative cerebral metabolic rate of glucose was significantly reduced in the temporoparietal junction and anterior temporal lobe of the right hemisphere ipsilateral to the exposure. Temperature rise was also observed on the exposed side of the head, but the magnitude was very small. The exposure did not affect task performance (reaction time, error rate). Our results show that short-term mobile phone exposure can locally suppress brain energy metabolism in humans.",Excluded
3478,"Necessity of repeat head computed tomography (CT) scans in mild traumatic brain injury patients. INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical TBI severity grading system. CT scanning has also become a sensitive diagnostic tool in assessing TBIs. Currently, there is a widely varied practice in evaluation of patients with mild TBIs. We hypothesize that patients with an initially positive head CT and stable GCS (15) are less likely to have positive repeat CTs than patients who's GCS has dropped below 15. METHOD(S): A 5 year retrospective analysis was done (Jan 2007- Dec 2011). Data points included ISS, ICU LOS, Hospital LOS, initial GCS, first head CT scan, lowest GCS between scans, and treatment after 2nd CT. Positive CT findings were considered an increase in contusion, bleed, edema, midline shift, or a new bleed. RESULT(S): In 369 patients, those with a stable GCS (15) were less likely to have a positive repeat CT scan than patients who whose GCS dropped (12.9% vs 24.9%, p<.01). They also tended to require less Interventions (0.8% vs 4.0%, p=0.09). Unchanged patients were more likely to have a lower ISS (14 vs 17, p<.01), ICU LOS(2 vs 3 days, p<.01), and Hospital LOS( 4 vs 6, p<.01). CONCLUSION(S): CT scans are a rapid, non-invasive diagnostic tool that can accurately diagnose a patient's intracranial status. Our study shows that most patients who have initially positive CT scans and maintain a stable GCS of 15 can still safely forego the cost and radiation exposure of repeated scans.",Excluded
2028,"Scatter compensation methods in 3D iterative SPECT reconstruction: A simulation study. Effects of different scatter compensation methods incorporated in fully 3D iterative reconstruction are investigated. The methods are: (i) the inclusion of an 'ideal scatter estimate' (ISE); (ii) like (i) but with a noiseless scatter estimate (ISE-NF); (iii) incorporation of scatter in the point spread function during iterative reconstruction ('ideal scatter model', ISM); (iv) no scatter compensation (NSC); (v) ideal scatter rejection (ISR), as can be approximated by using a camera with a perfect energy resolution. The iterative method used was an ordered subset expectation maximization (OS- EM) algorithm. A cylinder containing small cold spheres was used to calculate contrast-to-noise curves. For a brain study, global errors between reconstruction and 'true' distributions were calculated. Results show that ISR is superior to all other methods. In all cases considered, ISM is superior to ISE and performs approximately as well as (brain study) or better than (cylinder data) ISE-NF. Both ISM and ISE improve contrast-to-noise curves and reduce global errors, compared with NSC. In the case of ISE, blurring of the scatter estimate with a Gaussian kernel results in slightly reduced errors in brain studies, especially at low count levels. The optimal Gaussian kernel size is strongly dependent on the noise level.",Excluded
75,"Diabetic levels of glucose increase cellular reducing equivalents but reduce survival in three models of 661W photoreceptor-like cell injury. BACKGROUND: The effect of excess glucose on retinal cellular health remains controversial, and cellular reducing equivalents, as indicators of cellular energy production, are widely used as substitute indicators of retinal cellular health. These investigations hypothesised that excess energy substrate availability, as occurs in the diabetic retina, increases the susceptibility of retinal neurons to injury in the presence of increased cellular reducing equivalents.METHODS: The response of 661W cells to phototoxicity, oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and apoptosis induction by staurosporine was characterised in the presence of 5mM glucose and B27 defined media without insulin. Cellular insult was produced by phototoxicity, H2O2 and the apoptosis induction agent staurosporine. The effect of physiologically relevant alterations in environmental glucose on cellular reducing equivalents was assessed by MTT dye reduction and NAD(P)H assays, and cell survival was assessed via caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry.RESULTS: 661W photoreceptor-like cells underwent dose dependent cell death primarily by apoptosis in response to phototoxic insult, H2O2, and staurosporine by all measures of cellular viability. Exposure of cells to 25mM glucose (diabetic-type conditions) increased cell death in response to all insults as measured by caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Cellular reducing equivalents were nonetheless increased in all models of injury in the presence of excess glucose. The mechanism of this increase was partly due to increased NADPH but not NADH levels in the presence of 25mM glucose.CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to 25mM glucose decreased the resilience of 661W photoreceptor-like cells to a range of cellular stressors whilst maintaining or increasing cellular reducing equivalents, partly be increasing NADPH levels. This shows that in 661W cells, diabetic levels of glucose decrease cellular resilience to injury. The decoupling of cellular reducing equivalents levels from cell survival has important implications when investigating the mechanisms of neuronal damage in diabetic retinal neuropathy.",Excluded
1626,"Genetic and physiological regulation of non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells. Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. To investigate the process in NHEJ, we have established an in vitro system to clarify the measurement and analysis of the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining of DSBs, and applied the method to investigate NHEJ in human cells derived from patients suffering from cancer-prone hereditary diseases. A DSB was introduced in plasmid pZErO-2 at a specific site within the ccdB gene that is lethal to E. coli cells, and treated with nuclear extracts from human cells. The efficiency of rejoining in the nuclear extract from an A-T cell line was comparable to that from a control cell line. However, the accuracy of rejoining was much lower for the A-T cell extract than for the control cell extract. All mutations were deletions, most of which contained short direct repeats at the breakpoint junctions. The deletion spectrum caused by the A-T nuclear extract was distinct from that by the control extract. These results indicate that A-T cells have certain deficiencies in end-joining of double-strand breaks in DNA. The extract from BS cells also showed the similar activity and the lower fidelity of rejoing compared to that from normal cells. From the sequencing analysis of the junction of DSBs, it is speculated that the defect in the BLM helicase might cause irregular rejoining of DSBs. Radioadaptive response is the acquirement of cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by prior exposure to low dose. We investigated the in vitro end-joining activity of DNA ends in radioadaptive cells. Both the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining in the cells pre-exposed to low dose are increased comparing to those without pre-exposure. We also investigated the joining activity of DNA ends in p53-deficient cells. Pre-irradiation caused no apparent alteration in both the efficiency and fidelity of end-joining. These results suggest that the exposure to low dose activates a cellular function to repair DSBs efficiently, which is dependent on p53. These results indicate that NHEJ pathway is regulated by many factors; genetic regulation by ATM and BLM, and physiological conditions such as irradiation with ionizing radiation. The observations also suggest that in some occasions p53 might play a key role in NHEJ. [References: 103]",Excluded

3493,"Whole brain radiation therapy plus focal boost may be a suitable strategy for brain metastases in SCLC patients: a multi-center study. BACKGROUND: The treatment for brain metastases in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare different brain radiotherapy treatments on SCLC patients with brain metastases.METHODS: In this multi-center retrospective study, SCLC patients who had undergone whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases from January 2012 to December 2018 were retrospectively screened.RESULTS: A total of 263 eligible SCLC patients were included in this study, among whom, 73 were women and 190 were men. According to accepted brain radiotherapy, the remaining patients were divided into WBRT plus focal radiation boost (WBRT+boost), WBRT, and SRS groups. In pairwise comparisons of the overall survival (OS), WBRT+boost group led to longer survival than did WBRT both in all patients (17.9 vs 8.7 months; P < 0.001) and 140 matched patients (17.9 vs 11.7 months; P = 0.045). There were no significant differences in OS between WBRT+boost and SRS groups in all patients (17.9 vs 14.5 months; P = 0.432). Among 74 matched patients between WBRT+boost and SRS groups, however, patients who received WBRT+boost led to a longer survival than did SRS alone (21.8 vs 12.9 months; P = 0.040). In pairwise comparison of the intracranial progression-free survival time (iPFS), WBRT+boost group also showed survival advantages over WBRT (10.8 vs 6.5 months; P = 0.005) and SRS groups (10.8 vs 7.5 months; P = 0.032).CONCLUSION: Due to the SCLC-derived multiple brain metastases and better survival time, focal radiation boost combined with adjuvant WBRT may be a preferred strategy for SCLC patients with brain metastases.",Excluded
380,"Role of gamma knife therapy in the management of pituitary tumors. 1. Gamma knife therapy is an effective method of delivering radiation to pituitary tumors that have failed surgery and may be used as primary treatment in circumstances in which the patient refuses or is unsuitable for a transsphenoidal procedure. 2. Stereotactic radiosurgery with the gamma knife unit is generally administered in a single session unlike fractionated radiotherapy, which is administered four to five times per week over a 6-week period. 3. Preliminary data suggest that resolution of pituitary hypersecretion is faster with gamma knife therapy than with conventional radiotherapy. 4. Because of the nature of the gamma knife therapy and the fact that the radiation dose conforms to the tumor shape, there is a steep fall-off of radiation to surrounding tissue. Accordingly, the radiation dose to extrapituitary brain is substantially less with gamma knife radiosurgery than with conventional radiotherapy. This suggests that the development of second brain tumors and neurocognitive complications, which are significant risks with conventional radiotherapy, is much less likely with gamma knife surgery. 5. Gamma knife radiosurgery can be used to ablate tumors invading the cavernous sinus. 6. Gamma knife radiosurgery is safe as long as the dose of radiation to the optic structures is kept under 10 Gy. 7. Long-term follow-up is required for pituitary tumors treated by gamma knife therapy so as to determine its efficacy as well as its effects on pituitary function and any resultant complications.

The metabolic responses of nuclear and chromatin lipids from thymus to different doses and dose rates of gamma-irradiation of rats are discussed. In most cases, the nuclear and chromatin lipid responses are distinct. Changes in nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism in response to gamma-irradiation are suggested to connect with the signal transduction pathway and the regulation of the transcriptional and replicative chromatin activity.

3039,"LET dependence on killing effect and mutagenicity in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. PURPOSE: To assess the unique biological effects of different forms of ionizing radiation causing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we compared the killing effect, mutagenesis frequency, and mutation type spectrum using the model filamentous fungus Neurospora.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asexual spores of wild-type Neurospora and two DSB repair-deficient strains [one homologous recombination- and the other non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway-deficient] were irradiated with argon (Ar)-ion beams, ferrous (Fe)-ion beams, or X-rays. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), forward mutation frequencies at the ad-3 loci, and mutation spectra at the ad-3B gene were determined.RESULTS: The canonical NHEJ (cNHEJ)-deficient strain showed resistance to higher X-ray doses, while other strains showed dose-dependent sensitivity. In contrast, the killing effects of Ar-ion and Fe-ion beam irradiation were dose-dependent in all strains tested. The rank order of RBE was Ar-ion > Fe-ion > C-ion. Deletion mutations were the most common, but deletion size incremented with the increasing value of linear energy transfer (LET).CONCLUSIONS: We found marked differences in killing effect of a cNHEJ-deficient mutant between X-ray and high-LET ion beam irradiations (Ar and Fe). The mutation spectra also differed between irradiation types. These differences may be due to the physical properties of each radiation and the repair mechanism of induced damage in Neurospora crassa. These results may guide the choice of irradiation beam to kill or mutagenize fungi for agricultural applications or further research.",Excluded
2661,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded

The domestic load and the conventional charging stations behave in an uncertain manner. To operate the renewable energy sources efficiently for harvesting maximum power, instantaneous nonlinear dynamics should be captured online.

1807,"Treatment of posterior pelvic ring disruptions using a minimally invasive adjustable plate. OBJECTIVE: Iliosacral (IS) screw fixation and posterior tension band plate (TBP) technique are two treatment alternatives for posterior pelvic ring injuries. However, IS screw fixation requires continuous fluoroscopic guidance for appropriate screw insertion and carries a risk of neurovascular injuries. TBP technique also has some disadvantages, including limited reduction potential, difficulty in precontouring the plate and a higher rate of symptomatic implants. To address these limitations, we introduced a minimally invasive adjustable plate (MIAP). This study aims to present the preliminary radiological and clinical results of posterior pelvic ring disruptions treated with MIAP.METHODS: The MIAP conforms to the irregular shape of posterior pelvic ring and can be used without prebending. This plate has a role in reducing compressed or separated fractures/dislocations. Sixteen patients, including seven males and nine females, were treated with MIAP through a minimally invasive approach. The fracture patterns consisted of six Type B and ten Type C fractures according to OTA classification of fracture. Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. Postoperative rehabilitation programme was individualised and early exercise was encouraged. Patients were followed up and the functional outcome was evaluated based upon the scoring system proposed by Lindahl and associates.RESULTS: All posterior pelvic ring disruptions were reduced and fixed with MIAP. The average duration of surgery was 49 min, the average radiation exposure was 6s, and the average blood loss was 80 mL for the treatment of posterior pelvic ring injuries. Overall radiological results of the reduction were excellent in eleven patients and good in five. The patients were followed up for 30 months on average. All fractures healed. The functional outcome was excellent in ten patients, good in four and fair in two. There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries, implant failures, irritative symptoms or pressure sores due to subcutaneous implantation.CONCLUSION: Favourable clinical and radiological outcomes can be achieved in treating posterior pelvic disruptions with MIAP.

An electrode with adjacent optical fibers for measurements during navigation and radio frequency lesioning in the brain is modeled for Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in brain tissue. Relative reflected light intensity at 780 nm, I780, from this electrode and probes with identical fiber configuration are simulated using the intensity from native white matter as reference. Models are made of homogeneous native and coagulated gray, thalamus, and white matter as well as blood. Dual layer models, including models with a layer of cerebrospinal fluid between the fibers and the brain tissue, are also made. Simulated I780 was 0.16 for gray matter, 0.67 for coagulate gray matter, 0.36 for thalamus, 0.39 for coagulated thalamus, unity for white matter, 0.70 for coagulated white matter, and 0.24 for blood. Thalamic matter is also found to reflect more light than gray matter and less than white matter in clinical studies. In conclusion, the reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between gray and white matter during navigation. Furthermore, coagulation of light gray tissue, such as the thalamus, might be difficult to detect using I780, but coagulation in darker gray tissue should result in a rapid increase of I780.",Excluded

[11 C] PiB has been used widely as an amyloid imaging agent for brain PET. In recent years, [18 F] flutemetamol has been developed as a new PET amyloid imaging agent. In this study, PET images taken from the same patient using [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB were compared so that the amyloid deposition in the brain could be visually and quantitatively evaluated. Method(s): PET was conducted in three patients with amyloid- positive Alzheimer's disease (AD) and one patient with amyloidpositive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB. Ninety minutes after intravenous administration of 185 MBq of [18 F] flutemetamol, dynamic PET imaging was performed for 30 minutes. For [11 C] PiB, dynamic PET imaging was performed for 70 minutes immediately after administration of 350 MBq of [11 C] PiB. The distribution of amyloid deposition in the region of interest in each cortex was quantitatively evaluated using the standard uptake value (SUV) sum images taken in the latter half of the PET session when a higher level of brain amyloid deposition was more readily detectable. The SUV ratio (SUVR) was calculated using the SUV in the cerebellum as the reference value. Moreover, the mean cortical SUVR (MSUVR) was calculated from the SUVR data in the cortex where a high level of amyloid deposition was detected. Result(s): When both [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB PET images were evaluated, high levels of amyloid deposition were observed in the frontal lobe, posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), precuneus, parietal lobe, and lateral temporal lobe. On the other hand, amyloid deposition was only weakly evident in the medial temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and the cerebellar cortex. In [18 F] flutemetamol PET, the MSUVR was 2.32, and the MSUVR in the PCG was 2.68. In [11 C] PiB PET, the MSUVR was 2.04, and the MSUVR in the PCG was 2.26. These data indicate that, although the dose of radioisotope was lower in [18 F] flutemetamol PET, the SUVR in each cortex were generally high in [18 F] flutemetamol PET. Conclusion(s): [18 F] flutemetamol has a longer half-life and can be delivered for a longer duration.

1398,"Development of the gravity sensing system. The utricle and saccule contain hair cells, which are the peripheral sensors of change in gravity that transmit signals regarding these changes to the neural components of the vestibular system. Although the fundamental neural pathways, especially the vestibular reflex pathways, have been investigated extensively, the principals underlying the functional development of this system are under study at present. The objective of this review is to identify the gravity-sensing components of the vestibular system and to present an overview of the research performed on their development. The second part of this review is focused on one important aspect of development, the emergence of electrical excitability using the chick tangential vestibular nucleus as a model. The importance of this research to understanding vestibular compensation and vestibular disturbance during spaceflight is considered. Because there is a conservation of the fundamental pathways and function in vertebrate phylogeny from birds through mammals, findings from studies on avians should contribute significantly to understanding the mechanisms operating in mammals. Also, we expect that as the events and basic mechanisms underlying normal vestibular development are revealed, these will provide practical tools to investigate the pattern of recovery from dysfunction of the vestibular system.

Delayed toxicity after whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is of increasing concern in patients who survive more than one year with brain metastases from breast cancer. Radiation-related white matter toxicity is detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and has been correlated with neurocognitive dysfunction. This study assessed the risk of developing white matter changes (WMC) in breast cancer patients who underwent either WBRT plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or SRS alone. We retrospectively compared 35 patients with breast cancer brain metastases who received WBRT and SRS to 30 patients who only received SRS. All patients had evaluable imaging at a median of one year after their initial management. The development of white matter T2 prolongation as detected by T2 or FLAIR imaging was graded: grade 1 = little or no white matter T2 hyperintensity; grade 2 = limited periventricular hyperintensity; and grade 3 = diffuse white matter hyperintensity. After WBRT plus SRS, patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of WMC (p < 0.0001). After one year, 71.5 % of patients whose treatment included WBRT demonstrated WMC (42.9 % grade 2; 28.6 % grade 3). Only one patient receiving only SRS developed WMC. In long-term survivors of breast cancer, the risk of WMC was significantly reduced when SRS alone was used for management. Further prospective studies are necessary to determine how these findings correlate with neurocognitive toxicity. WBRT usage as initial management of limited brain disease should be replaced by SRS alone to reduce the risk of delayed white matter toxicity.",Excluded
1437,"The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum on the synkinesis of coordinated eye and head movements. We made a study of coordinated saccadic eye and head movements following random and predictable horizontal visual targets by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the cerebellum before the start of the gaze movement. We have found three effects of TMS on eye/head movements under these conditions. SACCADIC LATENCY-EFFECT: When stimulation took place shortly before movements commenced, significantly shorter latencies were found between target presentation and commencement of saccades: For predictable, to a lesser extent for random targets and TMS up to 75 ms before start of the saccade, latencies were significantly decreased when compared with no application of TMS. Without stimulation, latencies to random targets were within a range of 120-200 ms. EYE-HEAD INTERACTION-EFFECT: Without TMS, for amplitudes greater than 25 degrees, head movements usually preceded eye movements, as expected, especially for predictive responses. With the application of TMS shortly after the target display, the number of eye movements which preceded head movements, was significantly increased (p<0.001), and the delay between eye and head movements was reduced or reversed (p<0.001), compared with gaze movements without the use of TMS. SACCADIC PEAK VELOCITY-EFFECT: Applying transcranial magnetic stimulation at 5-25 ms after the position change of the 60 degrees target, and 50-5 s before the start of eye movement, mean peak velocity of synkinetic saccades increased up to 600 degrees/s, compared with 350-400 degrees/s without the use of TMS.

2245,"Cancer therapy, vomiting, and antiemetics. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer are capable of causing nausea and vomiting. With both treatment modalities, the nausea and vomiting is thought to be a second-order process rather than being due to direct stimulation of neuromechanisms that control vomiting. Both a peripheral (gastrointestinal tract) and central (chemoreceptor trigger zone) effect may be operating with both radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. With radiotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity is affected by the type of radiation, radiation dose and field size, fractionation schedule, individual patient factors, and the part of the patient that is radiated. Many different factors also influence the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. With both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting is probably mediated by a reduction in breakdown of various neurotransmitters. It is presumed that as the levels of neurotransmitters increase, nausea and vomiting develop. Antagonists of these neurotransmitters may afford some antiemetic protection. Nausea and vomiting may be so severe in patients with cancer that they may refuse potentially curative therapy because of it. Anticipatory nausea and vomiting may develop in patients who have become quite sick after receiving treatment. Exposure to stimuli associated with the emetogenic agent is then sufficient to trigger nausea and vomiting. Standard antiemetics do not help anticipatory nausea and vomiting, although behavioural training may. A variety of different drugs have proven useful as antiemetics, including dopamine antagonists such as phenothiazines, metoclopramide, corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), cannabinoids, and benzodiazapines. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are of value in some situations. New serotonin antagonists appear to be very promising and are currently undergoing clinical studies. Multiagent antiemetic regimens appear to be more effective than single agent regimens in some situations. [References: 123]",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to evaluate behavioural effects of an extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) in 3-month-old Mongolian gerbils submitted to global cerebral ischemia. After 10-min occlusion of both common carotid arteries, the gerbils were placed in the vicinity of an electromagnet and continuously exposed to ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) for 7 days. Their behaviour (locomotion, stereotypy, rotations, and immobility) was monitored on days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 after reperfusion for 60min in the open field. It was shown that the 10-min global cerebral ischemia per se induced a significant motor activity increase (locomotion, stereotypy and rotations), and consequently immobility decrease until day 4 after reperfusion, compared to control gerbils. Exposure to ELF-MF inhibited development of ischemia-induced motor hyperactivity during the whole period of registration, but significantly in the first 2 days after reperfusion, when the postischemic hyperactivity was most evident. Motor activity of these gerbils was still significantly increased compared to control ones, but only on day 1 after reperfusion. Our results revealed that the applied ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) decreased motor hyperactivity induced by the 10-min global cerebral ischemia, via modulation of the processes that underlie this behavioural response.",Excluded
1293,"Anatomically consistent CNN-based segmentation of organs-at-risk in cranial radiotherapy. Planning of radiotherapy involves accurate segmentation of a large number of organs at risk (OAR), i.e., organs for which irradiation doses should be minimized to avoid important side effects of the therapy. We propose a deep learning method for segmentation of OAR inside the head, from magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Our system performs segmentation of eight structures: eye, lens, optic nerve, optic chiasm, pituitary gland, hippocampus, brainstem, and brain. We propose an efficient algorithm to train neural networks for an end-to-end segmentation of multiple and nonexclusive classes, addressing problems related to computational costs and missing ground truth segmentations for a subset of classes. We enforce anatomical consistency of the result in a postprocessing step. In particular, we introduce a graph-based algorithm for segmentation of the optic nerves, enforcing the connectivity between the eyes and the optic chiasm. We report cross-validated quantitative results on a database of 44 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs with provided segmentations of the considered OAR, which were originally used for radiotherapy planning. In addition, the segmentations produced by our model on an independent test set of 50 MRIs were evaluated by an experienced radiotherapist in order to qualitatively assess their accuracy. The mean distances between produced segmentations and the ground truth ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 mm across different organs. A vast majority (96%) of the produced segmentations were found acceptable for radiotherapy planning.",Excluded
105,"Gold Nanorod-assisted Optical Stimulation of Neuronal Cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that nerves can be stimulated in a variety of ways by the transient heating associated with the absorption of infrared light by water in neuronal tissue. This technique holds great potential for replacing or complementing standard stimulation techniques, due to the potential for increased localization of the stimulus and minimization of mechanical contact with the tissue. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Moreover, thermal modelling suggests that cumulative heating effects might be potentially hazardous when multiple stimulus sites or high laser repetition rates are used. The protocol outlined below describes an enhanced approach to the infrared stimulation of neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism is based on the transient heating associated with the optical absorption of gold nanorods, which can cause triggering of neuronal cell differentiation and increased levels of intracellular calcium activity. These results demonstrate that nanoparticle absorbers can enhance and/or replace the process of infrared neural stimulation based on water absorption, with potential for future applications in neural prostheses and cell therapies.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Exposure to maternal stress in utero has long-term implications for the developing brain and has been linked with a higher risk of depression. The amygdala, which develops during the early embryonic stage and is critical for emotion processing, might be particularly sensitive.METHODS: Using data from a neuroimaging follow-up of the ELSPAC prenatal birth cohort (n=129, 47% men, 23-24 years old), we studied the impact of prenatal stress during the first and second half of pregnancy on the volume of the amygdala and its nuclei in young adult offspring. We further evaluated the relationship between amygdala anatomy and offspring depressive symptomatology. Amygdala nuclei were parcellated using FreeSurfer's automated segmentation pipeline. Depressive symptoms were measured via self-report using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).RESULTS: Exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy was associated with smaller accessory basal (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.27, p(FDR)=0.03) and cortical (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.29, p(FDR)=0.03) nuclei volumes. This effect remained significant after correcting for sex, stress during the second half of pregnancy, as well as maternal age at birth, birth weight, maternal education, and offspring's age at MRI. These two nuclei showed a quadratic relationship with BDI scores in young adulthood, where both smaller and larger volume was associated with more depressive symptoms (Accessory basal nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.05. p(FDR)=0.015; Cortical nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.04, p(FDR)=0.015).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy might have long-term implications for amygdala anatomy, which may in turn predict the experience of depressive symptoms in young adulthood.",Excluded
1615,"Abstract No. 552 Predictive value of voxel-based dosimetry using 99mTc-MAA single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography for dose to healthy liver from 90Y radioembolization. Purpose: Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE) with <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres is used for treatment of liver tumors, including neuroendocrine tumor (NET) liver metastases. Hepatotoxicity is a concern in NET patients receiving TARE, due to longer survival and exposure to additional radioactive therapies. The body surface area (BSA) method for prescribing <sup>90</sup>Y resin microspheres may under- or overestimate the ideal administered activity, resulting in radiation doses that may undertreat tumors or over-expose normal liver. The purpose of this study was to compare voxel-based dosimetry of healthy liver dose based on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): From a larger consecutive series of 127 patients, a retrospective review was performed for 26 patients who underwent 34 <sup>90</sup>Y-microsphere treatments (SIR-Spheres, Sirtex Medical) from March 2016 to March 2019. For each treatment, the liver and tumors were segmented manually using MIM v7 SurePlan (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) using the CT portion of the <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT study. Voxel-based dosimetry was performed using pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA imaging for predicting dose from treatment and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging to estimate final therapeutic dose. Dose calculations were performed assuming local deposition within the MIM SurePlan dosimetry platform. Result(s): A total of 390 tumors were segmented across 34 treatments. Tumor count per patient ranged from 1 to 32 (9.7 +/- 9.6). Tumor liver burden ranged from 1.2% to 66% (mean, 16.1%; median, 6.1%.) Whole liver volumes ranged from 1139 mL to 4780 mL (2124 +/- 867 mL). Healthy liver volumes ranged from 1011 mL to 2763 mL (1671 +/- 472 mL). The per-patient mean liver dose was found to be 31.6 +/- 11.9 Gy, and the mean healthy liver dose was found to be 28.2 +/- 12.8 Gy. A strong correlation was observed when comparing healthy liver absorbed dose measured by post-treatment imaging with what was predicted from pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA mapping (slope = 0.87 +/- 0.05; intercept = 3.0 +/- 1.5 Gy; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.924). This is in contrast with the observed relationship between BSA-derived administered activity and healthy liver volume (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.081). Conclusion(s): Voxel-based dose estimates to healthy liver based on pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA imaging strongly correlate to dose measurements from post-treatment imaging. This application may be useful for optimizing dose delivery in TARE, particularly in NET patients, given their greater risk for long-term hepatotoxicity. Copyright © 2021",Excluded

After a short summary of the mechanism of action of irradiation therapy and the types of different irradiation techniques, the therapeutic effects and side effects are analyzed in patients with different types of pituitary tumors, including our own experience with conventional radiotherapy and radiosurgery in patients with acromegaly. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has long been used to control growth and/or hormonal secretion of residual or recurrent pituitary tumors. However, patient selection for conventional radiotherapy still remains a controversial issue, because a number of potentially significant side effects, including hypopituitarism and other complications, have been described. Stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery methods have several potential advantages over conventional radiotherapy, including their use in patients with residual or recurrent pituitary tumors who had previously been treated by conventional radiotherapy, but long-term follow-up data with these relatively new techniques are still limited. © 2005 by Humana Press Inc.

3258,"Continuous intrathecal bupivacaine and opioid infusion for the treatment of chronic stage IV liposarcoma cancer pain and diffuse spinal metastasis. Introduction We present a 58yo male with stage IV liposarcoma and diffuse cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine metastasis. Patient described severe cancer bone pain, especially troublesome in the low back. His cancer was diagnosed in 2014 and the tumor was initially resected from the posterior thigh. Bone metastasis was later noted in 2015, and later that year he developed a pathological fracture of the femur which left him bedridden. While hospitalized he developed a DVT and PE. He was started on chemotherapy and radiation, which continued to weaken and exacerbate his back pain. In addition, he suffered from right sided blindness and deafness, metastasis to the lung, HTN and depression which continued to decrease his quality of life. Results/Case report In the context of the patient's diffuse metastasis, we considered his pain secondary to metastatic cancer to the spine. The patient described the majority of the pain to be located in the low levels of his back, and characterized the pain as achy, throbbing, without radiation and exacerbated with exertion. Prior to any interventional therapy, the patient underwent conservative management with oral, intravenous, and topical agents all which did not provide any pain relief. At this point, we discussed the benefits of placement of a neuroaxial catheter, and the patient was amendable. Our preference was placement of a tunneled epidural catheter for outpatient infusion, but we were unsuccessful in securing a long-term care facility to accept care for the epidural and its dressing changes. This would have been a more cost effective option, and one that would not require invasive surgery. Since this was not possible, we discussed the possibility of intrathecal pump placement, and this was successfully implanted as a culmination of past therapies. After pump implantation, the patient was started on intrathecal morphine at 2mg/day which did not provide sufficient pain control. The morphine dose was increased to 3mg/day, plus an assist device of 0.2mg Q4hrs. Even at 4.2mg/day intrathecal morphine, equivalent to 420mg of IV morphine and >1200mg PO morphine, opioids alone were still not providing adequate pain relief. At this point, we considered the option of adding intrathecal Bupivacaine to the infusion. The patient was already bedridden and lower extremity motor weakness was not a significant factor. We slowly titrated the Bupivacaine infusion to effect. It was not until we reached 6mg/day of 2% continuous intrathecal Bupivacaine, in addition to 0.6mg Q4hrs assist device (which brought the cumulative dose to 9.4mg/day intrathecal Bupivacaine) that the patient began to experience pain relief. Discussion Intrathecal pump is a reliable therapy for chronic pain. Bupivacaine, used in combination with opioids, is a helpful and safe method of treatment for patients who have not responded to intrathecal opioids alone. In our case, even at an unusual and extraordinary large dose of Bupivacaine and opioid combination, the patient maintained normal BP, HR and respiratory status. This treatment option may improve quality of life while providing pain relief for patients with cancer pain and already limited functional status.",Excluded

No effect of irradiation on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes was observed. Previously it was shown that, on exposure to gamma-rays, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylglycerol, as opposed to phosphatidylcholine, broke down into fragments of lower molecular weight.

3389,"Reversible brain swelling in experimental cerebral malaria. Recently, reversible brain swelling has been identified in cerebral malaria patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is unknown, if similar pathology occurs in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). We thus examined immunized C57BL/6 mice after single vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) and naive C57BL/6 mice upon infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA-expressing mCherry. All mice were assessed according to the Rapid Murine Coma and Behavioral Scale (RMCBS) score once naive mice showed ECM. We further analyzed brain pathology by using high resolution small animal MRI in order to assess brain swelling and blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), immunohistochemical staining for microglia, single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to locate parasites microscopically and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to study parasites on a nanoscopic level. In contrast to naive mice, that showed extensive BBBD and brain swelling, all immunized mice survived the challenge and showed either reversible brain swelling and mild BBBD or no pathological signal alteration on MRI. Furthermore, less microglial activation was found in immunized mice compared to naive mice. However, along the rostral migratory stream microglial activation appeared to be similar in both groups. Distinct brain areas with higher parasite density could be observed in both groups, although parasite distribution was more disseminated in naive mice. By employing CLEM, we demonstrated that parasites have a high propensity towards the endothelium. In summary, we showed for the first time that reversible brain swelling also occurs in a mouse model of ECM by using advanced imaging techniques. We further identified hot spots of parasite accumulation and inflammation. This model may present a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms of reversible brain swelling in ECM. .",Excluded
647,"omega-Conotoxin inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission evoked by dorsal root stimulation in rat superficial dorsal horn. A number of omega-conotoxins are potent and selective antagonists of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and are potentially effective as analgesic agents. omega-Conotoxins CVID and CVIB, venom peptides from Conus catus, inhibit N-type and N/P/Q-type VGCCs, respectively, in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. In the present study, we tested the effects of five different omega-conotoxins, CVID, CVIB, MVIIA, MVIIC and GVIA, on excitatory synaptic transmission between primary afferents and dorsal horn superficial lamina neurons of rat spinal cord. The N-type VGCC antagonists CVID (200nM) and MVIIA (500nM) completely and irreversibly inhibited excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the dorsal horn superficial lamina. The N- and P/Q-type VGCC antagonist CVIB (200nM) reversibly reduced evoked EPSC amplitude an average of 34+/-8%, whereas MVIIC (200nM) had no effect on excitatory synaptic transmission. In neurons receiving polysynaptic input, CVIB reduced both the EPSC amplitude and the ""success rate"" calculated as the relative number of primary afferent stimulations that resulted in postsynaptic responses. These results indicate that (i) the analgesic action of omega-conotoxins that antagonise N-type VGCCs may be attributed to inhibition of neurotransmission between primary afferents and superficial dorsal horn neurons, (ii) nociceptive synaptic transmission between primary afferents and superficial lamina neurons is mediated predominantly by N-type VGCCs, and (iii) in contrast to the irreversible inhibition by CVID, MVIIA and GVIA, the inhibition of excitatory monosynaptic transmission by CVIB is reversible.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The recommended treatment for O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM) is radiation therapy with concurrent/adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). However, it is well known that the clinical benefit from TMZ is lower in these patients. We sought to analyze patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone in this cohort using a large, hospital database.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM from 2010 to 2012 who received radiation (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of receiving chemoradiation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS) by treatment group and Cox regression analysis was used to assess impact of covariates on OS.RESULTS: There were 738 patients who met the study criteria, of which 107 (14.5%) received RT alone and 631 (85.5%) received CRT with median RT dose 6000cGy for both groups. Median follow up for living patients was 21.9 months. Ninety-two (12.5%) patients did not undergo any resection, 330 (44.7%) underwent a subtotal resection and 316 (42.8%) had a gross total resection.

Introduction: Dementing processes in the geriatric population are devastating and can result in early death and increased care giver burden. FTD has the core features of earlier decline and impairment in regulation of social interpersonal conduct.We describe a case of an elderly female who was found to have features of FTD which had directly resulted from gamma knife surgery. This is the first described case of left FTD secondary to gamma knife radiation to our knowledge. Case: The patient is a 76 year old African American female, otherwise healthy and on no any medications with a history of a left frontotemporal arteriovenous malformation. She underwent gamma knife radiation treatment resulting in radiation necrosis eight years prior to presentation. She presented to the clinic escorted by her daughter who observed personality changes in the patient including becoming argumentative, uncooperative, and increasingly hyper religious, with increased interpersonal conflicts surrounding patient's inability to follow-through on plans. The patient only admitted to trouble with memory. Patient was observed to have disinhibition and inappropriateness during the group interview. Geriatric Depression Scale was negative for depression. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15/30 with deficits including: recall 0/5, language (1/3 naming, 0/2 repetition, 0/1 fluency with only 3 F words), calculation 0/3; while attention and orientations were intact. Patient was unable to perform Trail-making test, Part B. Otherwise, she appeared robust, independent in ADL but needing some assistance with IADL.

OBJECTIVES: To report outcomes of patients with medical and/or surgical refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN) treated with gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GK SRS).METHODS: One hundred and forty-nine patients with 152 cases of TN treated with GK SRS were analyzed. All patients, except one, received a dose of 40Gy to the 50% isodose volume. The Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity score was used to grade pain. Actuarial rates of pain relief were calculated. Multiple factors were analyzed for association with pain relief.RESULTS: The median follow up was 27 months (4-71 months). Overall 92% of cases achieved a BNI score I-III after GK SRS. Of those who had pain relief after GK SRS, 32% developed pain recurrence defined as a BNI score of IV or V. The actuarial rate of freedom from pain recurrence (BNI scores I-III) of all treated cases at 1, 2 and 3-years was 76%, 69% and 60%, respectively. On univariate analysis age >=70 was predictive of better pain relief (p=0.046). Type of pain, prior surgery, multiple sclerosis, number of isocenters, treated nerve length, volume and thickness and distance from the root entry zone to the isocenter were not significant for maintaining a BNI score of I-III. Those who achieved a BNI score of I or II were more likely to maintain pain relief compared to those who only achieved a BNI score of III (93% vs 38% at three years, p<0.01). The rate of pain relief of twenty-seven patients who underwent repeat GK SRS was 70% and 62% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Toxicity after first GK SRS was minimal with 25% of cases experiencing only new or worsening post-treatment numbness.CONCLUSION: GK SRS provides acceptable pain relief with limited morbidity in patients with medical and/or surgical refractory TN.",Excluded

Gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations occur in mammalian electroencephalogram in a manner that indicates cognitive relevance. In vitro models of gamma oscillations demonstrate two forms of oscillation: one occurring transiently and driven by discrete afferent input and the second occurring persistently in response to activation of excitatory metabotropic receptors. The mechanism underlying persistent gamma oscillations has been suggested to involve gap-junctional communication between axons of principal neurons, but the precise relationship between this neuronal activity and the gamma oscillation has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that gamma oscillations coexist with high-frequency oscillations (>90 Hz). High-frequency oscillations can be generated in the axonal plexus even when it is physically isolated from pyramidal cell bodies. They were enhanced in networks by nonsomatic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<inf>A</inf>) receptor activation, were modulated by perisomatic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor-mediated synaptic input to principal cells, and provided the phasic input to interneurons required to generate persistent gamma-frequency oscillations. The data suggest that high-frequency oscillations occurred as a consequence of random activity within the axonal plexus.

This report describes the response of both the superficial and deep components of the gerbil pineal gland to a 30-min pulse of fluorescent light at the time of the nocturnal peak in pineal activity. When gerbils were maintained in a 14 h light:10 h dark photoperiod, mean melatonin concentrations in the superficial pineal gland ranged between 72 and 108 pg/gland during the day and first 4 h of darkness, rose to a peak of 399 pg/gland 7 h after lights out, then returned to basal levels at the expected time of light onset. Pineal melatonin contents were reduced to daytime values within 30 min after exposure of gerbils to fluorescent light at the time of the nocturnal peak. These changes in superficial pineal melatonin content reflected the circadian pattern in serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity, as would be expected if NAT controls melatonin synthesis. In addition to the reductions in NAT and melatonin content induced by nocturnal photic stimulation, there was a 30% reduction in mean pinealocyte nuclear volume. A nocturnal elevation in melatonin content but not in NAT activity occurred in the deep pineal gland.

One of the hallmarks of auditory neurons in vivo is spontaneous activity that occurs even in the absence of any sensory stimuli. Sound-evoked bursts of discharges are thus embedded within this background of random firing. The calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) has been characterized in vitro as a fast relay that reliably fires at high stimulus frequencies (< or =800 Hz). However, inherently due to the preparation method, spontaneous activity is absent in studies using brain stem slices. Here we first determine in vivo spontaneous firing rates of MNTB principal cells from Mongolian gerbils and then reintroduce this random firing to in vitro gerbil brain stem synapses at near-physiological temperature. After conditioning synapses with afferent fiber stimulation for 2 min at Poisson averaged rates of 20, 40, and 60 Hz, we observed a number of differences in the properties of synaptic transmission between conditioned and unconditioned synapses. Foremost, we observed reduced steady-state EPSC amplitudes that depressed even further during an embedded short-stimulation train of 100, 300, or 600 Hz (a protocol that thus simulates in vitro what probably occurs at the in vivo MNTB after a short sound stimulus in a silent background). Accordingly, current-clamp, dynamic-clamp, and loose-patch recordings revealed a number of action potential failures at the postsynaptic cell during high-frequency-stimulation trains, although the initial onset of evoked activity was still transmitted with higher fidelity. We thus propose that some in vivo auditory synapses are in a tonic state of reduced EPSC amplitudes as a consequence of high spontaneous spiking and this in vivo-like conditioning has important consequences for the encoding of signals throughout the auditory pathway.",Excluded

501,"Evaluation of reduced-dose CT for acute non-traumatic abdominal pain: evaluation of diagnostic accuracy in comparison to standard-dose CT. Background Patients with acute non-traumatic abdominal pain often undergo abdominal computed tomography (CT). However, abdominal CT is associated with high radiation exposure. Purpose To evaluate diagnostic performance of a reduced-dose 100 kVp CT protocol with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction as compared to a linearly blended 120 kVp protocol for assessment of acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain. Material and Methods Two radiologists assessed 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series of 112 consecutive patients with acute non-traumatic pain (onset < 48 h) regarding image quality, noise, and artifacts on a five-point Likert scale. Both radiologists assessed both series for abdominal pathologies and for diagnostic confidence. Both 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series were quantitatively evaluated regarding radiation dose and image noise. Comparative statistics and diagnostic accuracy was calculated using receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics, with final clinical diagnosis/clinical follow-up as reference standard. Results Image quality was high for both series without detectable significant differences ( P = 0.157). Image noise and artifacts were rated low for both series but significantly higher for 100 kVp ( P <= 0.021). Diagnostic accuracy was high for both series (120 kVp: area under the curve [AUC] = 0.950, sensitivity = 0.958, specificity = 0.941; 100 kVp: AUC >= 0.910, sensitivity >= 0.937, specificity = 0.882; P >= 0.516) with almost perfect inter-rater agreement (Kappa = 0.939). Diagnostic confidence was high for both dose levels without significant differences (100 kVp 5, range 4-5; 120 kVp 5, range 3-5; P = 0.134). The 100 kVp series yielded 26.1% lower radiation dose compared with the 120 kVp series (5.72 +/- 2.23 mSv versus 7.75 +/- 3.02 mSv, P < 0.001). Image noise was significantly higher in reduced-dose CT (13.3 +/- 2.4 HU versus 10.6 +/- 2.1 HU; P < 0.001). Conclusion Reduced-dose abdominal CT using 100 kVp yields excellent image quality and high diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of acute non-traumatic abdominal pain.",Excluded
3614,"Adaptive spatio-temporal filtering of multichannel surface EMG signals. A motor unit (MU) is defined as an anterior horn cell, its axon, and the muscle fibres innervated by the motor neuron. A surface electromyogram (EMG) is a superposition of many different MU action potentials (MUAPs) generated by active MUs. The objectives of this study were to introduce a new adaptive spatio-temporal filter, here called maximum kurtosis filter (MKF), and to compare it with existing filters, on its performance to detect a single MUAP train from multichannel surface EMG signals. The MKF adaptively chooses the filter coefficients by maximising the kurtosis of the output. The proposed method was compared with five commonly used spatial filters, the weighted low-pass differential filter (WLPD) and the marginal distribution of a continuous wavelet transform. The performance was evaluated using simulated EMG signals. In addition, results from a multichannel surface EMG measurement fro from a subject who had been previously exposed to radiation due to cancer were used to demonstrate an application of the method. With five time lags of the MKF, the sensitivity was 98.7% and the highest sensitivity of the traditional filters was 86.8%, which was obtained with the WLPD. The positive predictivities of these filters were 87.4 and 80.4%, respectively. Results from simulations showed that the proposed spatio-temporal filtration technique significantly improved performance as compared with existing filters, and the sensitivity and the positive predictivity increased with an increase in number of time lags in the filter. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2006.",Excluded
3181,"An unusual case of radioactive seed migration to the vertebral venous plexus and renal artery with nerve root compromise. PURPOSE: We report a case of prostate brachytherapy seed migration to the vertebral venous plexus and subsequently to the renal artery with corresponding dosimetry analysis describing nerve doses.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 52-year-old male with low-risk prostate carcinoma (clinical stage T1c; Gleason score=6; prostate-specific antigen level of 5.5) underwent transperineal permanent prostate seed implant. Postimplantation routine imaging had failed to locate the missing seed, but he subsequently presented with back pain and parathesia with radiation down the leg.RESULTS: CT with bony windows and MRI had located the seed in the left L5 vertebral venous plexus. Neurosurgical intervention failed to locate and remove the migrated seed. Postsurgery, the left lower limb parathesia persisted but had normal nerve conduction studies. Dose to the spinal nerve roots and nearby structures were estimated using a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation. Serial X-ray imaging and CT had found that the seed had further migrated to left renal hilum.CONCLUSIONS: Seed migration to vertebral venous plexus is uncommon and to our knowledge this is the third reported case. Its subsequent migration to the renal hilum is most unusual. CT with bony windows or MRI are required if this is suspected. There is risk of spinal or nerve root damage and dose to these structures has to be estimated using GEANT4, although the tissue tolerance in the setting of low-dose rates are unknown and long-term followup of this patient is required.",Excluded

Physiological mechanisms underlying vestibular function have important implications for our ability to understand, predict, and modify balance processes during and after spaceflight. The microgravity environment of space provides many unique opportunities for studying the effects of changes in gravitoinertial force on structure and function of the vestibular system. Investigations of basic vestibular physiology and of changes in reflexes occurring as a consequence of exposure to microgravity have important implications for diagnosis and treatment of vestibular disorders in human beings. This report reviews physiological principles underlying control of vestibular processes on earth and in space. Information is presented from a functional perspective with emphasis on signals arising from labyrinthine receptors. Changes induced by microgravity in linear acceleration detected by the vestibulo-ocular reflexes. Alterations of the functional requirements for postural control in space are described. Areas of direct correlation between studies of vestibular reflexes in microgravity and vestibular disorders in human beings are discussed. [References: 46]",Excluded
3533,"Involvement of nitric oxide in long-term potentiation of spinal nociceptive responses in rats. Nitric oxide plays an important role in spinal nociception. The present study explored the effects of nitric oxide on the spinal long-term potentiation associated with nociception. (1) Nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (1 mM, 20 microl) and the nitric oxide scavenger hemoglobin (2 mg/ml, 20 mul) strikingly blocked the induction of tetanic sciatic stimulation-induced spinal long-term potentiation of C-fiber-evoked field potentials. L-arginine, a substrate of nitric oxide synthase, completely reversed L-NAME-induced inhibition. However, D-NAME (1 mM, 20 microl), an inactive form of L-NAME, had little effect on the spinal LTP. (2) The same tetanic sciatic stimulation induced long-term thermal hyperalgesia, which was blocked by pre-application of L-NAME. These results suggest the involvement of nitric oxide in the spinal long-term potentiation of C-fiber-evoked field potentials and related behavior changes.",Excluded
2711,"Vascular abnormalities after treatment for craniopharyngioma. Introduction: Craniopharyngiomas occur in proximity to vessels of the circle of Willis, which may require manipulation in the course of surgical dissection. The tumors are frequently irradiated which may predispose to vascular abnormalities. We reviewed a large center's experience. Method(s): Records of the brain tumor program, spanning 21 years, were reviewed for patients with craniopharyngioma. Demographics, details of treatment, clinical course, and Results of imaging over time are described. Result(s): 50 patients with craniopharyngioma were identified, 8 of whom were excluded for inadequate data. 42 patients were followed over a mean of 7.2 years after treatment, 17 of whom eventually were found to have vascular abnormalities. Of these patients, 2 had received craniotomy alone with no radiation. The remainder had radiation, 4 after failure of initial intracystic therapy and either with or without further operation. 11 were treated with operation, either craniotomy or endoscopic biopsy or resection, followed by radiation. 3 patients developed cavernous malformations, 9 patients had aneurysmal dilatation of one or more vessels, and 10 had vessel narrowing or occlusion, which in some was documented to progress. Mean time to identification of the first abnormality was 3.4 years after radiation, and 1.4 years after operation alone. 2 patients with moya moya syndrome after radiation required cerebral revascularization procedures. Conclusion(s): A substantial percentage of patients develop vascular abnormalities after treatment for craniopharyngioma. They require long term surveillance and possible late intervention.

2029,"Neurotransmitter receptor expression by peripheral mononuclear cells: possible marker of neuronal damage by exposure to radiations. Peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) express several neurotransmitter systems. Increasing evidence suggests that PMC neurotransmitter receptors are involved in modulating immune responses. It is also thought that expression of PMC neurotransmitter receptors may reflect the status of homologous brain receptors. A problem encountered with assay of PMC neurotransmitter receptors was in developing techniques suitable for their assessment in spite of low density. In this paper we summarized findings on the expression of alpha1-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor subtypes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes characterized by radioligand binding assay techniques and immunocytochemistry. Human lymphocytes express alpha1A-, alpha1B- and alpha1D-adrenoceptor subtypes and dopamine D3, D4 and D5 receptors. Compared to radioligand binding assay, immunocytochemistry applied to cytospin-centrifuged peripheral lymphocytes allowed to assay receptor subtypes investigated in small amounts of blood. The development of sensitive and reproducible techniques for assaying PMC neurotransmitter receptor subtypes even in small amounts of blood such as those used for diagnostic purposes may allow to analyze their sensitivity to different conditions including radiation exposure.",Excluded
219,"Mechanisms of postspaceflight orthostatic hypotension: Low alpha <inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responses before flight and central autonomic dysregulation postflight. Although all astronauts experience symptoms of orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight, only ~20% actually experience presyncope during upright posture on landing day. The presyncopal group is characterized by low vascular resistance before and after flight and low norepinephrine release during orthostatic stress on landing day. Our purpose was to determine the mechanisms of the differences between presyncopal and nonpresyncopal groups. We studied 23 astronauts 10 days before launch, on landing day, and 3 days after landing. We measured pressor responses to phenylephrine injections; norepinephrine release with tyramine injections; plasma volumes; resting plasma levels of chromogranin A (a marker of sympathetic nerve terminal release), endothelin, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG, an intracellular metabolite of norepinephrine); and lymphocyte beta<inf>2</inf>-adrenergic receptors. We then measured hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to upright tilt. Astronauts were separated into two groups according to their ability to complete 10 min of upright tilt on landing day. Compared with astronauts who were not presyncopal on landing day, presyncopal astronauts had 1) significantly smaller pressor responses to phenylephrine both before and after flight; 2) significantly smaller baseline norepinephrine, but significantly greater DHPG levels, on landing day; 3) significantly greater norepinephrine release with tyramine on landing day; and 4) significantly smaller norepinephrine release, but significantly greater epinephrine and arginine vasopressin release, with upright tilt on landing day. These data suggest that the etiology of orthostatic hypotension and presyncope after spaceflight includes low alpha<inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responsiveness before flight and a remodeling of the central nervous system during spaceflight such that sympathetic responses to baroreceptor input become impaired.",Excluded
3371,"Recurrent breast cancer involving the brachial plexus identified by FDG PET/CT. Purpose: Identifying malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in breast cancer patients is challenging from both a clinical and an imaging perspective. We evaluated the ability of PET/CT to detect malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in patients with a prior history of breast cancer. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients presenting with neuropathy and a prior history who underwent a FDG PET/CT scan from 9/01/05 to 9/01/09 was undertaken. Patients were included if the neurologic examination documented a regional pain syndrome, motor abnormalities or sensory deficits and PET/CT was ordered within 1 month of presentation. Brachial plexus involvement was confirmed by biopsy and/or resolved with cancer treatment. The location of brachial plexus involvement and other sites of disease identified on PET/CT were correlated to the pathologic results and clinical outcome. Result(s): Arm pain or peripheral neuropathy led to PT/CT evaluation in 81 patients (mean age 67.3+/-9.6) who had subsequently biopsy or clinical follow-up. FDG uptake indicative of recurrent malignancy was identified in the brachial plexus on PET/CT scans in 66 patients (81.5%). Forty-three patients had biopsy confirmation and the rest demonstrated resolution on PET/CT following treatment. The linear FDG uptake within the thicken plexus ranged from mild to intense (SUVmax= 2.1-12.3; mean 5.6). In 3 patients discontinuous plexus involvement was seen and confirmed by biopsy as skip lesions. In all but 5 patients, the brachial plexus was the only site of breast cancer recurrence identified on PET/CT. In the 15 PET/CT negative patients, 12 had positive MR. Biopsy or clinical follow-up determined that these 12 patients did not have brachial plexus disease but MR signal abnormalities were due to from post-treatment radiation or surgical changes. Conclusion(s): PET/CT readily detects breast cancer involvement in the brachial plexus in presenting with upper extremity symptoms. FDG PET/CT was able to differentiate an active tumor from post-treatment changes.",Excluded

The loading schemes included no intervention, wearing a penguin suit, sleeping in a fetal position, wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position, reclining for 4 or 16 h/d, and maintaining upright posture for 4 or 16 h/d. <b>RESULTS:</b> Without intervention, the microgravity environment led to increased central pore pressure, radial displacement, and water content in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position can reduce disc pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content to 0.156 MPa, 11.50 kPa, 0.538 mm, and 1.390%, respectively. When astronauts return to the gravity environment, staying upright for 4 h can reduce the pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content of the intervertebral disc to 0.222 MPa, 10.72 kPa, 0.373 mm, and 0.219%, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study showed that wearing a penguin suit and sleeping in the fetal position both have the potential to protect the lumbar intervertebral disc from the negative effects caused by microgravity. Remaining in the upright posture for 4 h per day may help squeeze out the water in the intervertebral disc safely when astronauts return to the gravity environment. <b>Zhang S, Wang K, Zhu R, Jiang C, Niu W.

284,"A phase II trial of maintenance ADAPT therapy targeting colon cancer stem cells in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Background: Presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) appears to be the chief cause of drug resistance to cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapy. Experimental models suggest that these resistant cancer cells undergo dormancy transition that is best targeted with a stemness modulator in its activation window through a strategy that we call ADAPT: Activating (CSC) from Dormancy And Potentiate for Targeting. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that 5FU activates while celecoxib inhibits and depletes these putative colorectal CSC. We retrospectively administer three year ADAPT therapy in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients using capecitabine and celecoxib +/- radiation following maximal responses (complete (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)) to first-line combination chemotherapy. ADAPT therapy led to 30% CR and additional 10% surgical CR whose median survival reached 92.7 months in patients with unresectable MCRC. (Lin et al AACR 2010 LB-254).

Radiation-induced damage of ocular, orbital and eyelid structures are mainly reported for the optic nerve, retina, lens and lacrimal gland.

The ability of newest radiation techniques including IMRT and proton therapy to generate steep dose gradients may yield more accurate models in the future. Some toxicities are severe and irreversible, leading to vision loss, as in the case of radiation-induced optic neuropathy for which curative treatments are suboptimal. Other toxicities can lead to reversible vision loss but can be surgically corrected, as is the case for radiation-induced cataract.

1479,"Preconditioning-induced protection of photoreceptors requires activation of the signal-transducing receptor gp130 in photoreceptors. Retinal degenerations are a class of neurodegenerative disorders that ultimately lead to blindness due to the death of retinal photoreceptors. In most cases, death is the result of long-term exposure to environmental, inflammatory, and genetic insults. In age-related macular degeneration, significant vision loss may take up to 70-80 years to develop. The protracted time to develop blindness suggests that retinal neurons have an endogenous mechanism for protection from chronic injury. Previous studies have shown that endogenous protective mechanisms can be induced by preconditioning animals with sublethal bright cyclic light. Such preconditioning can protect photoreceptors from a subsequent damaging insult and is thought to be accomplished through induced expression of protective factors. Some of the factors shown to be associated with protection bind and activate the signal transducing receptor gp130. To determine whether stress-induced endogenous protection of photoreceptors requires gp130, we generated conditional gp130 knockout (KO) mice with the Cre/lox system and used light-preconditioning to induce neuroprotection in these mice. Functional and morphological analyses demonstrated that the retina-specific gp130 KO impaired preconditioning-induced endogenous protection. Photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO mice had reduced protection, although the Muller cell KO mice did not, thus gp130-induced protection was restricted to photoreceptors. Using an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that the photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO increased sensitivity to genetically induced photoreceptor cell death, demonstrating that gp130 activation in photoreceptors had a general protective role independent of whether stress was caused by light or genetic mutations.",Excluded

Objective: To present a case of a patient with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer with hemorrhagic metastases to the pituitary gland who presented with diabetes insipidus (DI). Case Presentation: A 56 year-old man with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer presented with failure to thrive. Eight years prior to admission he underwent a left hemi-thyroidectomy for a compressive goiter with pathology noting a follicular adenoma. Four years later while undergoing routine imaging, multiple lung and bone lesions were identified prompting a bone biopsy with pathology of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer. A complete thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection was performed confirming follicular thyroid cancer. Over the next several years, due to persistent disease confirmed both biochemically and with imaging, the patient received external bean radiation followed by 6 doses RAI totaling over 1200 mCi resulting in pancytopenia, thus precluding the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Five months after his last dose of RAI, the patient presented to our hospital with failure to thrive. Labs included TSH 0.021 mcU/ mL (on levothyroxine), thyroglobulin > 47000 ng/mL (antibody negative). Palliative care was consulted and dexamethasone was started for appetite stimulation. The following month the patient presented with confusion, blurry vision, polydipsia, polyuria with severe nocturia impacting his quality of life. Labs included sodium 140 mEq/L, serum osmolarity 288 mOsm/kg, urine osmolarity 192 mOsm/kg and urine sodium 39 mmol/L. Noncontrast MRI head showed a large mushroom appearing sellar lesion with hemorrhagic supra-sellar component compressing the optic chiasm. Dexamethasone was increased and intranasal DDVAP started for symptomatic relief. Patient was discharged on home hospice and passed away 6 weeks later. Discussion(s): Pituitary metastases, a rare complication of systemic malignancies, most commonly breast and lung cancer, are estimated to be 1-5% of sellar neoplasms, with the most reported presentation being DI (estimated to be 45%). Metastatic thyroid cancers, with an incidence of 10-35%, have a tendency to spread to the lung, followed by bone, brain, liver, and skin with pituitary metastases being extremely rare. In a case series of 22 patients with metastatic thyroid cancer to the pituitary gland, only 5 patients presented with DI out of which only one had follicular thyroid cancer.

In addition, an increased rate of dementia in young patients has been noted over the longer term, i.e. years.

136,"Microinjection of morphine into various amygdaloid nuclei differentially affects nociceptive responsiveness and RVM neuronal activity. The goal of the present study was to identify nuclei of the amygdala in which opioid-sensitive systems can act to recruit nociceptive modulatory circuitry in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and affect nociceptive responsiveness. In lightly anesthetized rats, 10 microg of morphine was bilaterally microinjected into basolateral, cortical, medial, central, and lateral nuclei of the amygdala to determine the relative influence on the activity of identified ON, OFF and NEUTRAL cells in the RVM and on the latency of the tail flick reflex evoked by noxious radiant heat. Infusions of morphine into the basolateral nuclei resulted in a substantial, naloxone-reversible increase in tail flick latency, and significantly increased ongoing firing of OFF cells and depressed that of ON cells. The reflex-related changes in cell firing were also attenuated. Morphine infusions into the cortical nuclei resulted in a small (approximately 1 s) but significant increase in tail flick latency. As with basolateral microinjections, ongoing activity of the OFF cells was increased, and although the ongoing firing of ON cells was not significantly changed, the reflex-related burst that characterizes these neurons was reduced. Microinjections in the medial nuclei again altered ongoing activity of both ON cells and OFF cells. However, the duration of the OFF cell pause and tail flick latency were unchanged. NEUTRAL cells were not affected by morphine at any site. Morphine applied within the central, medial lateral and dorsal lateral nuclei had no effect on RVM neurons or on the tail flick. Thus, focal application of morphine within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala produced hypoalgesia and influenced RVM ON and OFF cells in a manner similar to that seen following systemic or RVM opioid administration. Opioid action within the medial and cortical nuclei also influenced RVM cell activity, but did not prevent the reflex-related OFF cell pause, and failed to alter the tail flick substantially. These observations, plus the lack of an opioid-activated influence from the central and lateral nuclei, demonstrate fundamental differences among systems linking the different amygdalar nuclei with the RVM. One way in which the modulatory circuitry of the RVM might be engaged physiologically in behaving animals is via opioid-mediated activation of the basolateral nucleus.",Excluded
255,"Therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells can result from deregulated EGFR signaling. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with various downstream molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/GSK-3, Jak/STAT and others. Often these pathways are deregulated in human malignancies such as breast cancer. Various therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of EGFR family members including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been developed. A common problem with cancer treatments is the development of drug-resistance. We examined the effects of a conditionally-activated EGFR (v-Erb-B:ER) on the resistance of breast cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil as well as ionizing radiation (IR). v-Erb-B is similar to the EGFR-variant EGFRvIII, which is expressed in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate. Both v-Erb-B and EGFRvIII encode the EGFR kinase domain but lack key components present in the extracellular domain of EGFR which normally regulate its activity and ligand-dependence. The v-Erb-B oncogene was ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) which results in regulation of the activity of the v-Erb-ER construct by addition of either estrogen (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) to the culture media. Introduction of the v-Erb-B:ER construct into the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line increased the resistance to the cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs, hormonal-based therapeutics and IR.

Temozolomide is active in earlier stages of MF and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There are no published data on its use in MF patients with CNS involvement.METHODS: Four MF patients were treated with oral temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 d on a 28-day cycle) for CNS progression. Two patients received temozolomide with low-dose CNS irradiation as initial treatment, and two received temozolomide following disease progression after methotrexate-based chemotherapy and CNS irradiation. All patients received dexamethasone.RESULTS: Temozolomide was well tolerated; there were no treatment withdrawals or dose reductions caused by toxicity. Patient 1 had an excellent partial response in pre-irradiated disease. Patient 2 showed disease stabilization following irradiation. Patient 3 showed a complete response after a partial response to irradiation. Patient 4 demonstrated continued stabilization after a partial response to irradiation. Overall survival ranged from 10 to 33 months. Patient 3 remains alive and symptom-free at 23 months following treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide following low-dose CNS irradiation appears to be well tolerated and effective in MF patients with CNS progression. It may represent a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy containing methotrexate or an option for second-line therapy.",Excluded
500,"A pilot study using dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI as a response biomarker of the radioprotective effect of memantine in patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy. PURPOSE: This pilot prospective study sought to determine whether dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could be used as a clinical imaging biomarker of tissue toxicity from whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).METHOD: 14 patients who received WBRT were imaged using dynamic contrast enhanced DCE-MRI prior to and at 8-weeks, 16-weeks and 24-weeks after the initiation of WBRT. Twelve of the patients were also enrolled in the RTOG 0614 trial, which randomized patients to the use of placebo or memantine. After the unblinding of the treatments received by RTOG 0614 patients, DCE-MRI measures of tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) vascular permeability (Initial Area Under the Curve (AUC) Blood Adjusted) was analyzed. Cognitive, quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and blood samples were collected according to the patient's ability to tolerate the exams. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Following WBRT, there was an increasing trend in the vascular permeability of tumors (p=0.09) and NAWM (p=0.06) with time. Memantine significantly (p=0.01) reduced NAWM AUC changes following radiotherapy. Patients on memantine retained (COWA p= 0.03) better cognitive functions than those on placebo. No association was observed between the level of CEC and DCE-MRI changes, time from radiotherapy or memantine use.CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI can detect vascular damage secondary to WBRT. Our data suggests that memantine reduces WBRT-induced brain vasculature damages.",Excluded

1295,"Significant reduction of beta-amyloid in the CNS following external radiation: Implications for treatment in alzheimer's disease. Purpose/Objective(s): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly population, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau protein tangles. These events are especially prevalent in the hippocampus region which is responsible for long term memory. In this animal study, we investigated if cranial X-irradiation could reduce the formation of Ab plaques as a potential novel clinical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the rationale being that external beam radiotherapy has been used previously as an effective clinical treatment for systemic amyloidosis. Materials/Methods: A transgenic mouse model was used that expresses a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with early-onset AD. Radiation treatments were either a single dose (5 Gy, 10 Gy or 15 Gy) or daily fractionation (1 Gy, 2 Gy) to a dose of 10 Gy to a single side of the head. Brains were harvested at various times post-irradiation (2-8 wks) and coronal sections were evaluated for H&E and antibody specific immunohistochemistry to detect beta-amyloid plaques and assess radiation response, staining for IL1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, microglia cells (CD11b) and activated microglia cells (CD68). Result(s): Radiation treatments were well-tolerated. H&E stained tissue sections indicated no evidence of a significant decrease in cell density (Nissl staining) and no compelling evidence of significant cellular necrosis. No signs of devitalization, malacia or spongiosus or classic acute or chronic inflammatory features were evident. The number and size of beta-amyloid plaques were compared between the irradiated and shielded halves of the brain. The average number of plaques in the unirradiated brain increased with age, the values for 32, 34 and 38 week old animals were 43.9 (SD +/- 17.6; n = 9), 61.7 (SD +/- 19.8, n = 9) and 109 (SD +/- 26.9, n = 9) respectively. Radiation treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of plaques throughout the brain (paired t-test p = 0.002).This effect was more significant in the hippocampus region (p = 0.0004). At 4 weeks post-treatment 5, 10 and 15 Gy caused a 71 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 24%, 92 +/- 34% reduction in plaque incidence in the hippocampus. The greatest reductions were noted at longer times post-treatment. TGF-beta staining was restricted to the irradiated side of the brain, little or no site-specific staining of IL1 or TNF-alpha was seen. A trend was evident of activated microglia in the irradiated brain. Conclusion(s): We report the first experience that external beam irradiation can produce a significant reduction in beta-amyloid plaques associated with AD.",Excluded

672,"3D cerebral angiography: radiation dose comparison with digital subtraction angiography. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As the use of 3D rotational angiography (3D RA) for the evaluation of cerebral vasculature becomes more widespread, it is important to evaluate this imaging method's effect on patient radiation dose. The purpose of the study is to measure 3D RA radiation dose as compared with biplanar digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHOD(S): The distribution and peak skin dose were measured for 3D RA and biplanar DSA by using an anthropomorphic skull phantom. In addition, the cumulative incident dose, summed over all images in each acquisition, was determined. Measurements were acquired for our facility's standard 3D RA acquisition mode (25 degrees /s rotational speed; 162 total frames) and other available acquisition mode selections. RESULT(S): For 3D RA, the skin dose was found to be distributed across the back and sides of the skull with the peak skin dose located at the center of the back of the skull. The peak skin dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 15 mGy. For a biplanar DSA run, the peak skin dose was 58 mGy, also located at the back of the skull. The cumulative incident dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 33 mGy, compared with 53 mGy for biplanar DSA. CONCLUSION(S): The patient radiation dose for 3D RA is significantly lower than for biplanar DSA, by nearly a factor of 4 in peak skin dose and 40% lower in cumulative incident dose.",Excluded

The present paper describes the radiobiological effects induced by an exposure to ionizing radiation and their pathogenesis. The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radio-induced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low-doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described.

The relative SPECT values are often inaccurate by the scattering and limited spatial resolution of single photon emission CT (SPECT). These effects were studied using phantoms and some attentions on clinical application were investigated. Using cylindrical phantom divided into six compartments filled with various radioactivities, the linear correlation between SPECT value and radioactivity, and also correlation with partial reduction of radioactivity were identified. But the SPECT value was relatively increased in proportion to the reduction of radioactivity due to the increase of scattering contribution. The SPECT value represented lower radioactivity when the cortical thickness was smaller than two times of FWHM and represented half radioactivity when the cortical thickness was equal to FWHM. Excellent correlation between SPECT value and radioactive partial volume averaging of brain with CSF was recognized using our hand made phantom simulating various degree of atrophic brain. It is very important to compare SPECT image with X-CT or MR image to avoid misreading taking the above mentioned effects due to scattering and limited spatial resolution.",Excluded
768,"Heterogeneous expression of Ku70 in human tissues is associated with morphological and functional alterations of the nucleus. Ku70 is a subunit of DNA-protein kinase complex and involved in diverse intranuclear events including the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Ku70 is rich in the interphase nucleus of cultured cells. In human tissues, however, the distribution of Ku70 has not yet been systematically examined. To characterize the difference of Ku70 distribution between cells of human tissues and cultured cells, the expression of Ku70 was examined in various normal and neoplastic human tissues by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. In addition, the role of Ku70 in the cellular response against ionizing radiation (IR) was analysed in fibroblasts after exposure to 5 Gy IR and apoptotic indices were examined in Ku70-overexpressed fibroblasts from an ataxia telangiectasia patient and in normal fibroblasts, before and after irradiation. In contrast to cultured cells, Ku70 was not detected in some interphase cells of human tissues and was distributed heterogeneously, even in the same nucleus. Ku70 expression was strikingly low in terminally differentiated cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, glomerular capillary endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and was absent in spermatids. In spermatocytes, Ku70 was tightly integrated with chromosome filaments, unlike other somatic cells under mitosis. After exposure to IR, Ku70 expression was not increased in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts, but was significantly increased in normal fibroblasts. Most of the increased Ku70 was of soluble nuclear protein fraction. Furthermore, overexpression of Ku70 increased radiation resistance both in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts. The presented data indicate that the distribution of Ku70 in cells of human tissues is closely associated with the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, nuclear shape and the process of repair of DNA damage caused by IR.",Excluded
775,"Contribution of the Atm protein to maintaining cellular homeostasis evidenced by continuous activation of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient brains. Maintenance of genome stability is essential for keeping cellular homeostasis. The DNA damage response is a central component in maintaining genome integrity. Among of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions are double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. ATM is missing or inactivated in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a pleiotropic phenotype and suffer primarily from progressive ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. Additional features are immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that exhibits most of the clinical features of the human disease but very mild neuronal abnormality. The ATM protein is a multifunctional protein kinase, which serves as a master regulator of cellular responses to DSBs. There is growing evidence that ATM may be involved in addition to the DSB response in other processes that maintain processes in cellular homeostasis. For example, mounting evidence points to increased oxidative stress in the absence of ATM. Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in the brains of Atm-deficient mice not treated with DNA damaging agents. A canonical activation (increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) of the AP-1 pathway was found in Atm-deficient cerebra, whereas induction of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient cerebella is likely to mediate elevated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun. Although Atm(+/+) mice are capable of responding to ionizing radiation by activating stress responses such as the AP-1 pathway, Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. Our results further demonstrate that inactivation of the ATM gene results in a state of constant stress.",Excluded

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the role of radiosurgery in the management of symptomatic patients with brainstem compression from benign basal tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Over a 17-year, period 246 patients (202 vestibular schwannomas and 44 meningiomas) with brainstem compression from benign skull-base tumors were managed with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Median tumor volumes were 3.9 cm(3) (range, 0.8-39.0 mL) and 6.6 mL (range, 1.6-25.1 mL) for vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas, respectively. For both tumors, a median marginal dose of 13 Gy was prescribed. Median follow-up of patients was 65 months for vestibular schwannomas and 60 months for meningiomas. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the tumor-brainstem relationship on neuroimaging.RESULTS: Preservation of function was stratified according to grade of brainstem compression. We analyzed the effect of radiosurgery on symptoms of brainstem compression. The tumor control rate was 100 % for meningioma and 97% for vestibular schwannomas (although 5% required an additional procedure such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt). In patients with vestibular schwannoma, serviceable hearing was preserved in 72.0%. Balance improved in 31.9%, remained unchanged in 56.5%, and deteriorated in 11.6% of patients who had imbalance at presentation. Balance improved significantly in patients who had less tumor compression (p = 0.0357) after radiosurgery. Symptoms improved in 43.2% of patients with meningioma.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a minimally invasive option for patients with benign basal tumors that indent or distort the brainstem. A high tumor growth control rate and satisfactory rate of neurological preservation and symptom control can be obtained with radiosurgery.",Excluded
3372,"Acute and subacute myelopathy. Myelopathy is a term referring to any pathologic process affecting the spinal cord, and encompasses a broad spectrum of etiologies. The first step is to categorize myelopathy, according to the time to reach maximum deficit. Myelopathies are commonly classified as acute, subacute or chronic, for which the etiologies are totally different. Myelopathy is considered acute when the symptoms progress to their nadir in maximum 21 days after onset. Due to heterogeneity in pathogenesis, and the overlap in the clinical and imaging presentation among etiologies, acute myelopathy is considered as a diagnostic dilemma. A simple and efficient algorithm for timely identification of the underlying cause is thus useful. In this review, we provide a simplified approach for the differential diagnosis among all causes of acute myelopathies, and describe the principal clinical and imaging features of the main etiologies in adults, including recently characterized antibody-mediated myelitis, and its mimics.

274,"Point process analysis of noise in early invertebrate vision. Noise is a prevalent and sometimes even dominant aspect of many biological processes. While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance. This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.",Excluded

3368,"The role played by SLUG, an epithelialmesenchymal transition factor, in invasion and therapeutic resistance of malignant glioma. Purpose: In malignant gliomas, invasive phenotype and cancer stemness promoting resurgence of residual tumor cells, render treatment very difficult. Hence, identification of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors associated with invasion and stemness of glioma cells is critical. Method(s): To address the issue, we investigated several EMT factors in hypermotile U87MG and U251 cells, mouse xenograft model, and human glioma samples. Of several EMT markers, SLUG expression was notably increased at the invasive fronts of gliomas, both in mouse tumor xenografts and human glioma samples. The biological role played by SLUG was investigated using a colony-forming assay after chemotherapy and irradiation, and by employing a neurosphere culture assay. The effect of SLUG on glioma progression was examined in our patient cohort and samples, and compared to large public data from the REMBRANDT and TCGA. Result(s): Genetic upregulation of SLUG was associated with increased levels of stemness factors and enhanced resistance to radiation and temozolomide. In our cohort, patients exhibiting lower-level SLUG expression evidenced longer progression-free survival (P=0.042). Also, in the REMBRANDT dataset, a group in which SLUG was downregulated exhibited a significant survival benefit (P<0.001). Although paired gliblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples from our patients did not showed significant increase of SLUG expression, increased mRNA levels of SLUG was found in recurred GBM from TCGA (P=0.052), and in TMZ-treated glioma cells and mouse xenograft.

Objective(s): The objective of this research is to evaluate whether tissue autofluorescence-typically a source of contamination-provides a surrogate marker of white matter injury. Method(s): Tissue autofluorescence in autopsied specimens both experimental and clinical was characterized by spectral confocal microscopy and correlated to severity and chronicity as determined by standard histopathology. Result(s): Months after cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination, despite robust remyelination, autofluorescent deposits progressively accumulated in regions of prior pathology. Autofluorescent deposits (likely reflecting myelin debris remnants) were conspicuously localized to white matter, proportional to lesion severity, and displayed differential fluorescence over time. Strikingly, similar features were apparent also in autopsied MS tissue. Conclusion(s): Autofluorescence spectroscopy illuminates prior and ongoing white matter injury. The accumulation of autofluorescence in proportion to the extent of progressive atrophy, despite robust remyelination in the CPZ brain, provides important proof-of-concept of a phenomenon (insidious ongoing damage masked by mechanisms of tissue repair) that we hypothesize is highly relevant to the progressive phase of MS.

3313,"Thalamic energy dysregulation drives microstructural changes of thalamocortical projections in multiple sclerosis. Background and aims: Neuronal energy dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed as a key driver of axonal degeneration. Diffusion-weighted 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) can measure the diffusivity of creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr/PhCr), whose reduction in the MS thalamus has been proposed to reflect limited energy reserves. We tested in-vivo whether thalamic energy dysregulation is associated with microstructural degeneration of its projection tracts in MS. Method(s): Seventeen patients and thirteen healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3T MRI scan including DW-MRS and DW sequences. From DW-MRS, Cr apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(tCr)) was extracted in the bilateral thalami. Thalamic projections to somatosensory, dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes and optic radiations (case tracts) and the arcuate (non-thalamic control tract) were manually drawn in TrackVis (Fig.1). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), reflecting microstructural damage, were extracted for each tract. Associations between ADC(tCr) and microstructural parameters were tested using linear mixed-effect models. (Figure presented) Results: In MS, lower thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with lower mean FA and higher mean MD of pooled thalamo-cortical tracts after adjusting for disease duration, gender and tract-specific lesion load (p=0.033 and p=0.047). No correlation was found in HCs. Unadjusted tract-by-tract analysis confirmed the correlation between thalamic ADC(tCr) and MD in patients. The arcuate tract, not connected to the thalamus, showed no correlation (Fig.2). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with specific microstructural damage of thalamo-cortical tracts in MS, suggesting that energy dysfunction in this crucial hub - through an impaired Cr/PhCr transport/utilization - may disrupt thalamo-cortical networks by inducing the selective anterograde degeneration of connected fibers.",Excluded
3627,"Regulation of the DNA damage kinase ATM in the immune system. ATM is the protein kinase that is mutated in the hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). A-T patients display immune deficiencies, cancer predisposition, neuronal degeneration and radiosensitivity. The molecular role of ATM is to respond to DNA double-strand breaks and alterations in chromatin structure by phosphorylating its substrates, thereby promoting repair of damage or arresting the cell cycle. ATM is activated by two known co-factors in a stimulus dependent manner. Following the induction of double-strand breaks by ionising radiation, NBS1 (mutated in Nijmegen breakage syndrome) is required for activation of ATM. ATM can also be activated in the absence of DNA damage by agents that induce changes in chromatin structure. We have recently described ATMIN, for ATM INteractor, to be required for ATM activation under these conditions. How ATM is regulated within the context of the immune system is unclear. We are using genetic mouse models to dissect the contribution of the ATM co-factors, ATMIN and NBS, to its function within the immune system. We will present data on how ATM is regulated within lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, in order to maintain a functional immune system and suppress tumorigenesis.",Excluded
3051,"Regeneration of dopaminergic neurons after 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion in planarian brain. Planarians have robust regenerative ability dependent on X-ray-sensitive pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts. Here, we report that planarians can regenerate dopaminergic neurons after selective degeneration of these neurons caused by treatment with a dopaminergic neurotoxin (6-hydroxydopamine; 6-OHDA). This suggests that planarians have a system to sense the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and to recruit stem cells to produce dopaminergic neurons to recover brain morphology and function. We confirmed that X-ray-irradiated planarians do not regenerate brain dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA-induced lesioning, suggesting that newly generated dopaminergic neurons are indeed derived from pluripotent stem cells. However, we found that the majority of regenerated dopaminergic neurons were 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-negative cells. Therefore, we carefully analyzed when proliferating stem cells became committed to become dopaminergic neurons during regeneration by a combination of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, immunostaining/in situ hybridization, and 5-fluorouracil treatment. The results strongly suggested that G(2) -phase stem cells become committed to dopaminergic neurons in the mesenchymal space around the brain, after migration from the trunk region following S-phase. These new findings obtained from planarian regeneration provide hints about how to conduct cell-transplantation therapy for future regenerative medicine.",Excluded

1998,"Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields Promote In Vitro Neuronal Differentiation and Neurite Outgrowth of Embryonic Neural Stem Cells via Up-Regulating TRPC1. Exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. However, little is focused on the effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we studied the potential effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neural stem cells (eNSCs). We exposed eNSCs to ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 1, 2, and 3 days with 4 hours per day. We found that eNSC proliferation and maintenance were significantly enhanced after ELF-EMF exposure in proliferation medium. ELF-EMF exposure increased the ratio of differentiated neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth of eNSC-derived neurons without influencing astrocyes differentiation and the cell apoptosis. In addition, the expression of the proneural genes, NeuroD and Ngn1, which are crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, was increased after ELF-EMF exposure. Moreover, the expression of transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) was significantly up-regulated accompanied by increased the peak amplitude of intracellular calcium level induced by ELF-EMF. Furthermore, silencing TRPC1 expression eliminated the up-regulation of the proneural genes and the promotion of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth induced by ELF-EMF. These results suggest that ELF-EMF exposure promotes the neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of eNSCs via up-regulation the expression of TRPC1 and proneural genes (NeuroD and Ngn1). These findings also provide new insights in understanding the effects of ELF-EMF exposure on embryonic brain development.",Excluded
1075,"Brain tumor stem cells: Molecular characteristics and their impact on therapy. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor and ranks among the most lethal of human cancers with conventional therapy offering only palliation. Great strides have been made in understanding brain cancer genetics and modeling these tumors with new targeted therapies being tested, but these advances have not translated into substantially improved patient outcomes. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide, the first-line treatment for glioblastoma, have been developed to kill cancer cells. However, the response to temozolomide in GBM is modest. Radiation is also moderately effective but this approach is plagued by limitations due to collateral radiation damage to healthy brain tissue and development of radioresistance. Therapeutic resistance is attributed at least in part to a cell population within the tumor that possesses stem-like characteristics and tumor propagating capabilities, referred to as cancer stem cells. Within GBM, the intratumoral heterogeneity is derived from a combination of regional genetic variance and a cellular hierarchy often regulated by distinct cancer stem cell niches, most notably perivascular and hypoxic regions. With the recent emergence as a key player in tumor biology, cancer stem cells have symbiotic relationships with the tumor microenvironment, oncogenic signaling pathways, and epigenetic modifications. The origins of cancer stem cells and their contributions to brain tumor growth and therapeutic resistance are under active investigation with novel anti-cancer stem cell therapies offering potential new hope for this lethal disease. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

3502,"Activation of ATM and phosphorylation of p53 by heat shock. p53 protein is phosphorylated in response to various stresses. Here we examined phosphorylation of p53 protein in normal human diploid cells after heat shock at 43 degrees C for 2 h. We found that heat shock stimulates phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 but not at Ser20, while X-irradiation at 4 Gy and 10 J/m(2) of UV induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and less significantly at Ser20. Increased phosphorylation of Ser15 was also observed in heat shocked GM638, the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line. Although X-ray irradiation induced phosphorylation of Ser6, 9, 20, and 37 in GM638 cells, heat shock did not affect the phosphorylation level of these serines. We observed little or no phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in two primary ataxia telangiectasia fibroblast cells, that are defective in ATM. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that immunoprecipitated ATM from both heat-shocked and X-irradiated normal human diploid cells can phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 to a similar extent. These results indicate that heat shock induces phosphorylation of p53, especially at Ser15, and its phosphorylation is mediated by ATM kinase.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fiberoptic collimation technique on auditory neural stimulation in the cochlea with 808 nm wavelength lasers.BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, the pulsed near-infrared lasers in the 800-1000 nm wavelength range have been investigated as an emerging technique to trigger auditory neural response in the cochlea. A laser beam divergence in the optical stimulation pathway exists, which may affect stimulation efficiency and spatial selectivity.METHODS: The fiberoptic collimation technique was proposed for cochlear neuron stimulation, and the C-lens element was designed as the collimation structure. The spiral ganglion cells in deafened guinea pigs' cochlea were irradiated with collimated and uncollimated near-infrared lasers. Optically evoked auditory brainstem response (OABR) under the two laser output modes were recorded.RESULTS: Laser with the collimation technique evoked an average 58% higher OABR amplitude than the uncollimated laser output. In addition, the collimated laser setup consumed on average 35.2% of laser energy compared with the uncollimated laser when evoking the same OABR amplitude.CONCLUSIONS: The fiberoptic collimation technique improved stimulation efficiency and reduced stimulating energy consumption in near-infrared neural stimulation in cochlea. The positive effects of laser collimation technique could benefit further research in optically based cochlear implants.",Excluded
1919,"Long-term results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer. Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemoresponsive tumor but overall survival remains poor even in limited disease (LD). With the aim of eradicating chemoresistant tumor cells and reducing toxicity, we investigated in this phase II trial the feasibility and outcome of a sequential approach of induction chemotherapy (CT) followed, in responding patients with LD-SCLC, by intensified platinum-based CT and concurrent thoracic irradiation (TI). Material(s) and Method(s): We treated 55 consecutive LD-SCLC patients with three 21-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, epiadriamycin and vincristine (CEV) as induction CT. In 44 (80%) patients there was an objective response and they received treatment intensification consisting of TI and concomitant CT with carboplatin and etoposide plus recombinant granulocite colony stimulating factor. Twenty-five (57%) patients were submitted to twice-daily thoracic irradiation (TDTI; 1.5 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 45 Gy) and 19 (43%) to once-daily thoracic irradiation (ODTI; 2 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 50 Gy). Result(s): Median follow up was 75 months (range, 42-102). Of 44 patients submitted to intensification with TI plus CT, 32 (73%) had a complete and 12 (27%) a partial response. Median overall survival of all 55 patients was 17 months with actuarial survival probabilities of 2 and 5 years, 32 and 25%, respectively. Analysis of patient sub-groups showed a 5-month median survival in non-responders, 19 in TDTI and 17 in ODTI patients, respectively. Two and 5 year survival probabilities were 0% in non-responders, 40 and 35% in TDTI and 39 and 21% in ODTI patients, respectively. At present, 13 of 44 responders are still alive, of which nine (20%) have been progression-free from 45 to 93 months (median 60). Treatment failure was registered in 31 (70%) of 44 patients who received both induction and intensification treatment. One-half of patients had intrathoracic recurrence, eight of which only local and the remaining seven local and distant. Fourteen (32%) patients had brain metastases. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 24 (55%) patients with no differences between treatment groups. Grade 3 esophagitis was registered in four (9%) patients: in 3/25 (12%) and 1/19 (5%) of those who received TDTI and ODTI, respectively (P=not significant). Acute radiation pneumonitis occurred in three (12%) patients submitted to TDTI. No clinically debilitating pulmonary fibrosis, permanent esophageal stricture or toxic death was observed. Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC patients late concurrent CT plus TI is feasible and effective. Our long-term results are similar to the best reported in the literature. Despite the high incidence of complete response obtained, however, one-half of the patients had intrathoracic relapse and one-third brain metastases. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1967,"A rodent in situ glioma allograft model to study bone marrow-derived cell migration. Radiotherapy (RT) induced hypoxia recruits bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to tumors through the upregulation of Stromal Derived Factor-1, a chemokine that binds to receptor CXCR4 present on BMDCs. The infiltration of BMDCs, which includes endothelial progenitors, pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated macrophages, immature monocytes, VEGFR<sup>+</sup> hemangiocytes, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells has been implicated in supporting tumor establishment by contributing to tumor growth, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, inflammation, and immune suppression. In this work, we have used a rodent glioma in situ allograft model to study the recruitment/migration of BMDCs post RT. Female albino C57 (8-10 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) animals underwent +DsRed bone marrow transplant (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J donor mouse). Following engraftment, glioma cells were cranially implanted with 1x10 glioma cells (GL261-Luc, Perkin Elmer), at an average size of 26.4mm indicated by a bioluminescence signal of 5.28x10 photons/sec/cm/sr, animals underwent 6Gy (RadSource 2000, 250kVp, 25mA) of irradiation limited to a 1cm wide slit centered on the tumor. Bioluminescence (tumor size) and fluorescence imaging (+DsRed BMDCs) was performed prior to and at 1-and 2-weeks post-RT to assess tumor growth and measure the influx of +DsRed BMDCs. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the tumor and brain. To study the effect of BMDCs in tumor regression, tumors were irradiated at a smaller size (9.3mm) with 10Gy irradiation. At 1-week post-RT, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of BMDCs (CD45+) in the tumor. In our model 6Gy radiation was able to stall the growth of the tumor. Irradiated tumors did not significantly change in tumor size at either 1-or 2-weeks post irradiation compared to pre-RT size. In addition, irradiated tumors were significantly smaller than untreated tumors (p=0.0008) 1-week post-RT. Using flow cytometry 1-week post irradiation, we observed a significant increase in the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the irradiated tumor (23.5% of cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the irradiated brain (6.17% cells +DsRed BMDCs, p=0.03) as well as a significant increase in the tumors (16.6% cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the brain (11.1% cells +DsRed BMDCs p=0.02). There was no difference in the number of +DsRed BMDCS in tumors +/- irradiation or brains +/- irradiation. We found similar results in our tumor regression model using flow cytometry 1-week post-RT; we observed an increase in the number of BMDCs CD45+ in the tumor (~20% of cells CD45+) compared to control tumors (~6% of cells CD45+). Indicating that tumor size at the onset of RT did not effect the migration of BMDCs. Fluorescence imaging did not measure any significant change in the DsRed signal at 1-or 2-weeks post-irradiation. We have successfully shown that post-RT there is an increase in BMDCs migration at 1-week post RT regardless of tumor size at RT. Further experimentation is needed to better elucidate the role of BMDCs in tumor inflammation and immune suppression as well as angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Our next step is to perform immunohistochemistry on our collected tumor tissue to map out the spatial location of migrated BMDCs within the tumor.",Excluded
2270,"Prognostic grading system specifically for elderly patients with brain metastases after stereotactic radiosurgery: A 2-institution study. OBJECTIVE With the aging of the population, increasing numbers of elderly patients with brain metastasis (BM) are undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Among recently reported prognostic grading indexes, only the basic score for brain metastases (BSBM) is applicable to patients 65 years or older. However, the major weakness of this system is that no BM-related factors are graded. This prompted the authors to develop a new grading system, the elderly-specific (ES)-BSBM. METHODS For this IRB-approved, retrospective cohort study, the authors used their prospectively accumulated database comprising 3267 consecutive patients undergoing Gamma Knife SRS for BMs during the 1998-2016 period at the Mito GammaHouse. Among these 3267 patients, 1789 patients >= 65 years of age were studied (Yamamoto series [Y-series]). Another series of 1785 patients >= 65 years of age in whom Serizawa and colleagues performed Gamma Knife SRS during the same period (Serizawa series [S-series]) was used for validity testing of the ES-BSBM. RESULTS Two factors were identified as strongly impacting longer survival after SRS by means of multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model with a stepwise selection procedure. These factors are the number of tumors (solitary vs multiple: HR 1.450, 95% CI 1.299-1.621; p < 0.0001) and cumulative tumor volume (<= 15 cm<sup>3</sup> vs > 15 cm<sup>3</sup>: HR 1.311, 95% CI 1.078-1.593; p = 0.0067). The new index is the addition of scores 0 and 1 for these 2 factors to the BSBM. The ES-BSBM system is based on categorization into 3 classes by adding these 2 scores to those of the original BSBM. Each ES-BSBM category has 2 possible scores. For the category ES-BSBM 4-5, the score is either 4 or 5; for ES-BSBM 2-3, the score is either 2 or 3; and for ES-BSBM 0-1, the score is either 0 or 1. In the Y-series, the median survival times (MSTs, months) after SRS were 17.5 (95% CI 15.4-19.3) in ES-BSBM 4-5, 6.9 (95% CI 6.4-7.4) in ES-BSBM 2-3, and 2.8 (95% CI 2.5-3.6) in ES-BSBM 0-1 (p < 0.0001). Also, in the S-series, MSTs were, respectively, 20.4 (95% CI 17.2-23.4), 7.9 (95% CI 7.4-8.5), and 3.2 (95% CI 2.8-3.6) (p < 0.0001). The ES-BSBM system was shown to be applicable to patients with all primary tumor types as well as to those 80 years or older. CONCLUSIONS The authors found that the addition of the number of tumors and cumulative tumor volume as scoring factors to the BSBM system significantly improved the prognostic value of this index. The present study is strengthened by testing the ES-BSBM in a different patient group. Copyright ©AANS 2018.",Excluded

PURPOSE: In radiation biology, rats are often irradiated, but the precise dose distributions are often lacking, particularly in areas that receive scatter radiation. We used a non-dedicated set of resources to calculate detailed dose distributions, including doses to peripheral organs well outside of the primary field, in common rat exposure settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed dose reconstruction in a rat through an analog to the conventional human treatment planning process. The process consisted of: (i) Characterizing source properties of an X-ray irradiator system, (ii) acquiring a computed tomography (CT) scan of a rat model, and (iii) using a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine to generate the dose distribution within the rat model. We considered cranial and liver irradiation scenarios where the rest of the body was protected by a lead shield. Organs of interest were the brain, liver and gonads. The study also included paired scenarios where the dose to adjacent, shielded rats was determined as a potential control for analysis of bystander effects.RESULTS: We established the precise doses and dose distributions delivered to the peripheral organs in single and paired rats. Mean doses to non-targeted organs in irradiated rats ranged from 0.03-0.1% of the reference platform dose. Mean doses to the adjacent rat peripheral organs were consistent to within 10% those of the directly irradiated rat.CONCLUSIONS: This work provided details of dose distributions in rat models under common irradiation conditions and established an effective scenario for delivering only scattered radiation consistent with that in a directly irradiated rat.",Excluded

In addition, different methods suitable for use in a routine monitoring programme of ESD are discussed. Although the need for additional data is acknowledged, the results reported reinforce the need for routine assessments to be made of ESDs in FGIPs. At present, the most reliable and accurate form of ESD measurement would seem to be arrays of TLDs. However, transducer based methods although likely to be less accurate, have considerable advantages in relation to a continuous monitoring programme. It is also suggested that there may be the potential locally for threshold dose area product (DAP) values to be set for specific procedures. These could be used to provide early warning of the potential for skin injuries.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The neuropathological mechanism of heart rhythm disorders, following spinal cord pathologies, to our knowledge, has not yet been adequately investigated. In this study, the effect of the ischemic neurodegeneration of the thoracic sympathetic nuclei (TSN) on the heart rate (HR) was examined following a spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SSAH).METHODS: This study was conducted on 22 rabbits. Five rabbits were used as a control group, five as SHAM, and twelve as a study group. The animals' HRs were recorded via monitoring devices on the first day, and those results were accepted as baseline values. The HRs were remeasured after injecting 0.5 cc of isotonic saline for SHAM and 0.5 cc of autolog arterial blood into the thoracic spinal subarachnoid space at T4-T5 for the study group. After a three-week follow-up with continuous monitoring of their HRs, the rabbit's thoracic spinal cords and stellate ganglia were extracted. The specimens were evaluated by histopathological methods. The densities of degenerated neurons in the TSN and stellate ganglia were compared with the HRs.RESULTS: The mean HRs and mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia in control group were 251+/-18/min, 5+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 3+/-1/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The mean HRs and the mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia were detected as 242+/-13/min, 6+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 4+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup> in SHAM (P>0.05 vs. control); 176+/-19/min, 94+/-12/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 28+/-6/mm<sup>3</sup> in the study group (P<0.0001 vs. control and P<0.005 vs. SHAM), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: SAH induced TSN neurodegeneration may have been responsible for low HRs following SSAH.

Four questions addressed distal and proximal paresis: impaired hand functions, problems raising the arm, carrying weights, and lifting objects from a high shelf. Eighty-one relapse-free patients were neurologically examined. Treatment was mastectomy (51%) or breast-conserving surgery (49%), radiotherapy to the supraclavicular +/- axilla with median 60 Gy maximum dose. Sixty-five subsequent control patients had breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy to the breast only with 55 Gy median dose. Median follow up was 10 and 7.4 years, respectively. Sixteen patients had RIBP, 7 had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 1, 4 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and 2 grade 4 RIBP. Thirty-seven patients had fibrosis and 32 had arm edema. Four patients with RIBP had no fibrosis (n = 2) or fibrosis of the axilla only (n = 2). Specificity of the question ""impaired hand functions"" for RIBP was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78); sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96). Specificity of the question ""raising the arm"" was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.9-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04-0.45); the rate of false-positive control patients was 3%.

Patients with breast irradiation only stated moderate/pronounced impaired hand functions; and problems carrying weights and lifting objects from a high shelf in 38%, 58%, and 77%, not significantly different from patients with RIBP or the patients with supraclavicular radiation. RIBP is not necessarily associated with fibrosis. The aim of the questionnaire was screening of a population at risk for RIBP.

Patient and treatment characteristics were collected and summarized as well as interfraction shifts and treatment-related outcomes. This dataset includes 124 patients with an associated 358 intracranial tumors. Twenty-four patients presented with primary brain tumors, which included 14 meningiomas and 10 other histologies, with 100 patients having brain metastases. Sixty tumors were post-operative, while 298 were intact. The median dose for primary tumors was 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter. Median patient follow-up was 6.28 months. 91% of patients with metastases maintained local control. Our early clinical experience has demonstrated limited toxicity profiles and high patient tolerance, which suggests that mask-based Gamma Knife SRS provides a safe alternative option for frameless SRS. Patients with large target volumes where fractionation is preferred or with small target volumes in non-eloquent areas can be considered for this approach. Response rates are encouraging, and continued follow-up is necessary to investigate long-term control and survival. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1798,"Reduction in radiation during percutaneous lumbar pedicle screw placement using a new device. OBJECTIVE: To assess a new intradermal locator device for percutaneous placement of lumbar pedicle screws.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were alternately assigned to two groups. The locator group underwent lumbar pedicle screw placement using the intradermal locator. The control group was aided by traditional fluoroscopy. Baseline demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, operation time, intraoperative fluoroscopy time and guidewire insertion time were recorded. All postoperative CT scans were reviewed by an independent spine surgeon to grade screw placement accuracy.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (180 screws) were assigned to the locator group and 30 patients (128 screws) to the control group. The locator device could significantly reduce the fluoroscopy time [3.9 sec (SD = 1.9) vs. 9.6 sec (SD = 5.8), p < 0.001] and guidewire insertion time [2.69 min (SD = 0.67) vs. 4.49 min (SD = 1.96), p < 0.001] compared with the conventional method for each pedicle screw. The whole operation time of the locator group was shorter than that of the control group [2-segment: 243.2 min (SD = 16.9) vs. 301.7 min (SD = 14.9), p < 0.001; 1-segment: 154.5 min (SD = 14.3) vs. 194.6 min (SD = 19.3), p < 0.001]. As for the rates of pedicle breaches, postoperative VAS scores, no significant difference was found between the two groups.CONCLUSION: The intradermal locator device could help reduce the radiation exposure in percutaneous pedicle screw placement while maintaining the accuracy.",Excluded
2731,"Focused ultrasound enhanced intranasal delivery of brain derived neurotrophic factor produces neurorestorative effects in a Parkinson's disease mouse model. Focused ultrasound-enhanced intranasal (IN + FUS) delivery is a noninvasive approach that utilizes the olfactory pathway to administer pharmacological agents directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN + FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN + FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN + FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the method and potential of IN + FUS for the delivery of bioactive factors for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.",Excluded
3547,"Photoinactivation of an identified motoneurone in the locust Locusta migratoria. 1. The common inhibitory motoneurone 1 (CI1) in the mesothoracic ganglion of the locust was photoinactivated using a helium-cadmium laser or a mercury lamp as light source. Treated animals showed no signs of abnormal locomotory behaviour over periods of up to 40 days. 2. Photoinactivation of part of the neurone in the ganglion, i.e. the soma and the primary neurite, is sufficient to cause irreversible degeneration of all the peripheral extensions of the neurone. Three weeks after photoinactivation, all GABA immunoreactivity had disappeared from the axon branches of the photoinactivated neurone and from their terminals on one of the target muscles investigated, the anterior coxa rotator M92, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials could no longer be elicited through stimulation. This was taken as proof of functional denervation of the muscle with regard to its inhibitory input. By this time, the axon of CI1 in nerve N3C1, which supplies M92, had also disappeared. 3. Animals treated during the fourth or fifth instars showed a permanent loss of the photoinactivated mesothoracic CI1 neurone after moulting into adulthood. 4. Denervation of M92 in the middle legs of instars and adults by axotomy of N3 always led to rapid functional reinnervation of the muscle. The first sign of reinnervation (excitatory neuromuscular activity upon mechanical stimulation of the tarsi) was detected electrophysiologically as early as 8 days after severing the motor nerve. 5. The elimination of CI1 by photoinactivation for a period of up to 40 days did not influence parameters of the target muscle, such as size, number of fibres and phenotypes of fibres defined histochemically according to their myofibrillar ATPase isoforms, irrespective of whether the operation was performed in instars or adults. Similarly, the short period of denervation following axotomy before reinnervation took place did not affect the fibre type composition of the muscle.",Excluded
994,"Effects of radiation dose reduction in Volume Perfusion CT imaging of acute ischemic stroke. PURPOSE: To examine the influence of radiation dose reduction on image quality and sensitivity of Volume Perfusion CT (VPCT) maps regarding the detection of ischemic brain lesions.METHODS AND MATERIALS: VPCT data of 20 patients with suspected ischemic stroke acquired at 80 kV and 180 mAs were included. Using realistic reduced-dose simulation, low-dose VPCT datasets with 144 mAs, 108 mAs, 72 mAs and 36 mAs (80 %, 60 %, 40 % and 20 % of the original levels) were generated, resulting in a total of 100 datasets. Perfusion maps were created and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) measurements were performed. Qualitative analyses were conducted by two blinded readers, who also assessed the presence/absence of ischemic lesions and scored CBV and CBF maps using a modified ASPECTS-score.RESULTS: SNR of all low-dose datasets were significantly lower than those of the original datasets (p < .05). All datasets down to 72 mAs (40 %) yielded sufficient image quality and high sensitivity with excellent inter-observer-agreements, whereas 36 mAs datasets (20 %) yielded poor image quality in 15 % of the cases with lower sensitivity and inter-observer-agreements.CONCLUSION: Low-dose VPCT using decreased tube currents down to 72 mAs (40 % of original radiation dose) produces sufficient perfusion maps for the detection of ischemic brain lesions.KEY POINTS: * Perfusion CT is highly accurate for the detection of ischemic brain lesions * Perfusion CT results in high radiation exposure, therefore low-dose protocols are required * Reduction of tube current down to 72 mAs produces sufficient perfusion maps.",Excluded

PURPOSE: A multicenter phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy of rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine (R-MPV) followed by consolidation reduced-dose whole-brain radiotherapy (rdWBRT) and cytarabine in primary CNS lymphoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received induction chemotherapy with R-MPV (five to seven cycles); those achieving a complete response (CR) received rdWBRT (23.4 Gy), and otherwise, standard WBRT was offered (45 Gy). Consolidation cytarabine was given after the radiotherapy. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving rdWBRT. Exploratory end points included prospective neuropsychological evaluation, analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter changes using the Fazekas scale, and evaluation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a prognostic factor.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with median age of 60 years (range, 30 to 79 years) and median Karnofsky performance score of 70 (range, 50 to 100). Thirty-one patients (60%) achieved a CR after R-MPV and received rdWBRT. The 2-year PFS for this group was 77%; median PFS was 7.7 years. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached (median follow-up for survivors, 5.9 years); 3-year OS was 87%. The overall (N = 52) median PFS was 3.3 years, and median OS was 6.6 years. Cognitive assessment showed improvement in executive function (P < .01) and verbal memory (P < .05) after chemotherapy, and follow-up scores remained relatively stable across the various domains (n = 12). All examined MRIs (n = 28) displayed a Fazekas score of <= 3, and no patient developed scores of 4 to 5; differences in ADC values did not predict response (P = .15), PFS (P = .27), or OS (P = .33).CONCLUSION: R-MPV combined with consolidation rdWBRT and cytarabine is associated with high response rates, long-term disease control, and minimal neurotoxicity.",Excluded

Confinement studies are performed to simulate the psychological effects that may be experienced on a long-term space flight. A general psycho-physiological model assumes that mood and cognitive functioning are impaired during confinement as a result of an absence of physical activity. The aim of the MARS500 study initiated by the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) and the European Space Agency (ESA) is to gather data, knowledge and experience to help prepare for a real mission to Mars. A test run with 105 days of isolation was performed prior to 520 days of isolation. Psycho-physiological data of this study are presented here. We hypothesized that exercise, as it has been shown in laboratory settings, would be able to prevent and counteract mood changes during isolation. Electrocortical data (EEG) and a self report on current psychological and physical state were recorded several times prior to and after exercise during the isolation period. Data revealed a clear effect of exercise on mood and electrocortical activity. Moreover, it was shown that mood and brain cortical activity decreased during the first 11 weeks of isolation and reached baseline again in the last week of isolation. A correlation analysis revealed a significant relation between mood data and electrocortical activity. We conclude (1) that confinement is accompanied by psycho-physiological changes and (2) that exercise is a suitable method to counteract psycho-physiological deconditioning during confinement.",Excluded

Low-power, near-infra-red laser irradiation has been used to relieve patients from various kinds of pain, though the precise mechanisms of such biological actions of the laser have not yet been resolved. To investigate the cellular mechanisms by near-infra-red laser on the nervous system, we examined the effect of 830-nm laser irradiation on the energy metabolism of the rat brain. The diode laser was applied for 15 min with an irradiance of 4.8 W/cm(2). Tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content of the irradiated area in the cerebral cortex was 19% higher than that of the non-treated area, whereas the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content showed no significant difference. Laser irradiation at another wavelength (652 nm) had no effect on either ATP or ADP contents. The temperature of the tissue was increased by 4.4-4.7 degrees C during the irradiation of both wavelengths. These results suggest that the increase in tissue ATP content did not result from the thermal effect, but from a specific effect of the laser operated at the 830-nm wavelength.",Excluded

Objective: To report a rare case of glioblastoma arising from trigeminal nerve with leptomeningeal spread of disease, and discuss the origin of this tumor. Background(s): Glioblastoma (GB) is a WHO Grade IV tumor typically arising in the supratentorial compartment of the brain. Gliomas arising from cranial nerves (CN) are extremely rare. Design/Methods: A 77 year old gentleman presented with four month history of numbness over the right side of his face and progressive bilateral hearing loss. One week prior to presentation, he also developed left facial weakness, left eye ptosis, diplopia and lower back pain. On examination, he was found to have loss of sensation in a V1-V3 distribution on the right, a left pupil sparing third nerve palsy, bilateral sensironeural hearing loss, and a left peripheral VII CN palsy Results: MRI brain showed a cisternal mass infiltrating the right CN V with extensive enhancement and thickening of bilateral CN including III, V, VII, and VIII. MRI of the spine showed nodular enhancement at the level of the cauda equina. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Biopsy of the right CN V mass showed this to be glioblastoma. Conclusion(s): Leptomeningeal dissemination of glioblastoma is rare, occurring in about 4% of cases. In most of these cases, a parenchymal component is present that eventually disseminates along the ependymal lining of the brain to involve the leptomeninges. We here describe a unique presentation of a GB most likely arising from a CN followed by widespread leptomeningeal dissemination. The root entry zone (either the glial segment or the transition segment) of the cranial nerve is thought to be the anatomical point of origin for gliomas arising from CNs.

To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded

Pulses of infrared radiation (IR; 1,863 nm, 200 micros, 200-250 Hz for 2-5 s, delivered via an optical fiber) produced a rapid, transient temperature increase of 6-12degreeC (above a baseline of 24-30degreeC). These IR pulse trains evoked transient increases in both nuclear and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) of 0.20-1.4 microM, with a simultaneous reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in regions containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IR-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] continued in medium containing no added Ca<sup>2+</sup> (+/-Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers) and low [Na<sup>+</sup>], indicating that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase was mediated by release from intracellular stores. Consistent with this hypothesis, the IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] response was prolonged and eventually blocked by inhibition of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase with cyclopiazonic acid, and was also inhibited by a high concentration of ryanodine and by inhibitors of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate).

The IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase was inhibited by TRPV4 inhibitors (HC-067047 and GSK-2193874), and immunostaining of spiral ganglion cultures demonstrated the presence of TRPV4 and TRPM2 that colocalized with ER marker GRP78. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevations is conferred by TRP channels on ER membranes, which facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux into the cytosol and thereby contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release via IP<sub>3</sub> and ryanodine receptors.

2535,"Revolution in Radiation. In the past few decades, there have been many changes in the field of radiotherapy. These include better imaging, better motion management, improvements in treatment planning, better position verification and more precise treatment delivery. This has led to an increased use of radiotherapy and to significant improvements in clinical outcome. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT, aka SABR) is currently the standard of care for patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC. The technique is now safely used for more centrally located, larger and multiple lesions as well. SBRT is increasingly being considered as an alternative to surgery in operable patients. The results of two randomized clinical trials which were closed prematurely due to poor accrual, suggest equivalence between SBRT and surgery. Comparative effectiveness studies point in the same direction. New randomized trials on this topic are currently recruiting. In stage III NSCLC, radiotherapy can also be delivered with increased precision. Although the use of much higher dose has not (yet) led to better outcomes, the newer radiation techniques are associated with less toxicity and over the years, there has been a steady improvement in control and survival rates. The use of immunotherapy in combination with radiotherapy holds many promises. The role of proton therapy is still investigational. For patients with oligometastatic disease or oligoprogression, local treatments including radiotherapy can be highly effective and may lead to long term control and improvements in survival. We are awaiting the results of randomized studies to unequivocally show this benefit. In LS-SCLC, there is still discussion on the schemes for thoracic radiotherapy (BID or QD). The improvement in median survival in both arms of the recent CONVERT trial compared to earlier studies are probably exemplary for the general improvements in radiotherapy techniques. In ES-SCLC patients, thoracic radiotherapy is advocated for those patients with a response after chemotherapy but with residual disease in their chest. In ES-SCLC, prophylactic cranial irradiation is nowadays sometimes replaced with MRI-surveillance. Delayed cranial irradiation is than used in about two out of three patients. An important breakthrough in radiotherapy is the introduction of MRI guidance on the linear accelerator. This not only provides better soft-tissue imaging, but also for the first time, continuous imaging during the delivery of the treatment. The anatomical information from the MRI made daily with the patient on the treatment couch can be used to daily adapt the treatment plan. This allows for the use of smaller margins and early results demonstrate important benefits, especially in high-risk patients.

We continue to offer radiosurgery treatment to selected NF2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease patients and consider that the late risk of malignancy arising after irradiation must be put in the context of the condition being treated, the treatment options available to these individuals, and their life expectancy.",Excluded
760,"Efficacy and safety of CyberKnife radiosurgery in elderly patients with brain metastases: a retrospective clinical evaluation. BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been increasingly applied for up to 10 brain metastases instead of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) to achieve local tumor control while reducing neurotoxicity. Furthermore, brain-metastasis incidence is rising due to the increasing survival of patients with cancer. Our aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife (CK) radiosurgery for elderly patients.METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients with brain metastases >= 65 years old treated with CK-SRS at our institution since 2011 and analyzed data of primary diseases, multimodality treatments, and local therapy effect based on imaging follow-up and treatment safety. Kaplan-Meier analysis for local progression-free interval and overall survival were performed.RESULTS: We identified 97 patients (233 lesions) fulfilling the criteria at the first CK-SRS. The mean age was 73.2 +/- 5.8 (range: 65.0-87.0) years. Overall, 13.4% of the patients were > 80 years old. The three most frequent primary cancers were lung (40.2%), kidney (22.7%), and malignant melanoma (15.5%). In 38.5% (47/122 treatments) multiple brain metastases were treated with the CK-SRS, with up to eight lesions in one session. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 1.05 (range: 0.01-19.80) cm<sup>3</sup>. A single fraction was applied in 92.3% of the lesions with a median prescription dose of 19 (range: 12-21) Gy. The estimated overall survivals at 3-, 6-, and 12 months after SRS were 79, 55, and 23%, respectively. The estimated local tumor progression-free intervals at 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 72 months after SRS were 99.2, 89.0, 67.2, 64.6, and 64.6%, respectively. Older age and female sex were predictive factors of local progression. The Karnofsky performance score remained stable in 97.9% of the patients; only one patient developed a neurological deficit after SRS of a cerebellar lesion (ataxia, CTCAE Grade 2).CONCLUSIONS: SRS is a safe and efficient option for the treatment of elderly patients with brain metastases with good local control rates without the side effects of WBRT. Older age and female sex seem to be predictive factors of local progression. Prospective studies are warranted to clarify the role of SRS treatment for elderly patients.",Excluded
809,"Tractography to visualise the relationship of the optic radiation to epileptogenic lesions prior to neurosurgery. Background A third of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment and may be amenable to surgery. A major concern is to avoid causing new deficits. As conventional MR imaging does not delineate the optic radiation, the risk to vision from surgery cannot be predicted, nor can surgery be tailored to minimise the risk. Methods Conventional structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired in 13 patients with medically refractory epilepsy due a lesion near the optic radiation and undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. The optic radiation was delineated and visualised in relation to the lesions on anatomical images and in 3D reconstructions. Pre- and post-operative visual fields were acquired by Goldmann perimetry. Results The relationship between the epileptogenic lesion and the optic radiation was demonstrated in each patient provididing helpful additional information in deciding whether to proceed with surgery, and in planning the surgical procedure and approach. Prseoperative and postoperative imaging findings correlated with the visual field data. Conclusion The optic radiation shows significant anatomical variability, but can be reliably delineated by tractography. As surgical disruption of the optic radiation has serious consequences for the patient, DTI tractography proves a useful technique in this population. Future integration with real-time neuronavigation will inimise the risks of neurosurgery.",Excluded

Local therapy procedures are complex and suffer from special difficulties in the evaluation of their effectiveness by imaging techniques, because they are inevitably accompanied by alterations in the imaging, barrier disturbances and contrast medium uptake. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
1814,"ATM phosphorylation of Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein is required in a DNA damage response. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is characterized by extreme radiation sensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer. The phenotypes are similar to those of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) disease, where there is a deficiency in a protein kinase that is activated by DNA damage, indicating that the Nbs and Atm proteins may participate in common pathways. Here we report that Nbs is specifically phosphorylated in response to gamma-radiation, ultraviolet light and exposure to hydroxyurea. Phosphorylation of Nbs mediated by gamma-radiation, but not that induced by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light, was markedly reduced in ATM cells. In vivo, Nbs was phosphorylated on many serine residues, of which S343, S397 and S615 were phosphorylated by Atm in vitro. At least two of these sites were underphosphorylated in ATM cells. Inactivation of these serines by mutation partially abrogated Atm-dependent phosphorylation. Reconstituting NBS cells with a mutant form of Nbs that cannot be phosphorylated at selected, ATM-dependent serine residues led to a specific reduction in clonogenic survival after gamma-radiation. Thus, phosphorylation of Nbs by Atm is critical for certain responses of human cells to DNA damage.",Excluded

252,"Preclinical MRI reveals anti-VEGF therapy mitigates radiation necrosis. Purpose: Radiation necrosis, a severe but late occurring injury to normal tissue within and surrounding a radiation treatment field, has been described as a slow, continuous process in which increased levels of VEGF-A lead to breakdown of the blood brain barrier [1]. Thus, a strategy that involves blocking VEGF-A from reaching capillaries and repairing ""leaky"" capillaries is a possible therapeutic approach for radiation necrosis. In this work, in concert with a novel mouse model of radiation necrosis [2], the therapeutic effects of the humanized anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) and the murine anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1.1 (Genentech) are monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. Method(s): Hemispheric irradiation of mouse brain was performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife PerfexionTM (GK), a state-of-the-art unit used for stereotactic irradiation of patients with malignant brain tumors. Three cohorts of 7-8 week old female mice (n=5) were irradiated with a single 60-Gy dose (50% isodose) of GK radiation. At this dose, the onset of radiation necrosis typically occurs 3-4 weeks post-irradiation. Mouse cohort #1 was an irradiated but untreated control; cohort #2 received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation; cohort #3 received B20- 4.1.1 (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 4-to-13 weeks post-irradiation. Mice were imaged from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation, using an Agilent/Varian DirectDriveTM 4.7-T small-animal MR scanner. Result(s): The MRI-derived volumes of radiation necrosis for control, bevacizumab-treated, and B20-4.1.1-treated mice are plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of time post-irradiation. Both anti-VEGF antibodies slow the overall rate of progression (p<0.0001, week 10). Considering the initial 3-7 week period postirradiation, bevacizumab has the same mitigative effect as B20-4.1.1 (p = 0.8, week 7). However, for the latter 3-week period (7-10 weeks post-irradiation), radiation-induced necrosis developed at a higher rate than in the B20-4.1.1-treated cohort (p<0.0001, week 10), indicating that the mitigative effect of bevacizumab was weaker than B20-4.1.1 in the late period following the initiation of treatment. Histology results support the MR data. The irradiated hemispheres of the control mice demonstrated many of the classic histologic features of radiation necrosis. In contrast, the irradiated hemisphere of the bevacizumab-treated mouse showed only modest tissue damage and the irradiated hemisphere of the B20-4.1.1-treated mouse displayed no visible tissue damage. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a significant mitigative effect of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in a mouse model of radiation necrosis, an effect also observed recently in a group of brain-tumor patients treated with bevacizumab [3]. Efforts to verify the mechanism of action of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in the treatment of radiation necrosis in the mouse model are ongoing. (Graph presented).",Excluded
2591,"The Role of Advanced Imaging in Assessing Response to Definitive Chemoradiation Before Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We examined the responses to chemoradiation according to imaging modality in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Provided patients achieved at least a partial response, advanced imaging response neither affected survival nor added information to the decision to offer prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), suggesting that limited-stage SCLC patients with partial response using any imaging modality should not be denied PCI. Introduction: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) improves survival for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Evidence for PCI in limited-stage SCLC largely derives from studies requiring only chest x-ray (CXR) to determine remission status. We analyzed thoracic chemoradiation therapy (TCRT) outcomes according to imaging modality to determine which patients benefitted most from PCI. Patients and Methods: All limited-stage SCLC patients who received TCRT as well as PCI at our institution were reviewed. Imaging between TCRT end and PCI start was characterized as complete (CR), partial (PR), or other response. Result(s): Thirty-eight consecutive patients were assessed for TCRT response before PCI with CXR (n = 21), chest computed tomography (CT; n = 27), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 11). CR was identified on 71% of CXRs, 41% of CT scans, and 18% of PET/CT scans. Median survival was 28.3 months for the entire cohort and did not differ for patients who had CXR alone versus CT and/or PET/CT for restaging (P =.78) or those with PR using any modality versus CR using all modalities (22.6 months vs. 45.5 months; P =.22). CT CR patients had numerical but not statistically significant improved 2-year (P =.18) and 3-year (P =.13) survival compared with CT PR. Conclusion(s): CXR remains an appropriate modality to assess TCRT response before PCI in limited-stage SCLC. Advanced imaging did not inform the decision to offer PCI in this study. Because of similar excellent survival profiles independent of imaging modality and TCRT response, this analysis suggests limited-stage SCLC patients with PR using any modality should not be denied PCI, akin to standards for extensive-stage SCLC.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The thermal damage of the surrounding tissue can be an unwanted result of continuous-wave laser irradiations. In order to propose an effective alternative to conventional surgical techniques, photothermal damage must be taken under control by a detailed dose study. Real-time temperature monitoring can be also an effective way to get rid of these negative effects. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of a new laser-thermoprobe, which consists of a continuous-wave 1,940-nm Tm:fiber laser and a thermocouple measurement system for brain surgery in an ex vivo study.STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A laser-thermoprobe was designed for using the near-by tissue temperature as a real-time reference for the applicator. Fresh lamb brain tissues were used for experiments. 320 laser shots were performed on both cortical and subcortical tissue.RESULTS: The relationship between laser parameters, temperature changes, and ablation (removal of tissue) efficiency was determined. The correlation between rate of temperature change and ablation efficiency was calculated.CONCLUSION: Laser-thermoprobe leads us to understand the basic laser-tissue interaction mechanism in a very cheap and easy way, without making a change in the experimental design. It was also shown that the ablation and coagulation (thermally irreversible damage) diameters could be predicted, and carbonization can be avoided by temperature monitoring.",Excluded
2698,"Dark light, rod saturation, and the absolute and incremental sensitivity of mouse cone vision. Visual thresholds of mice for the detection of small, brief targets were measured with a novel behavioral methodology in the dark and in the presence of adapting lights spanning ~8 log(10) units of intensity. To help dissect the contributions of rod and cone pathways, both wild-type mice and mice lacking rod (Gnat1(-/-)) or cone (Gnat2(cpfl3)) function were studied. Overall, the visual sensitivity of mice was found to be remarkably similar to that of the human peripheral retina. Rod absolute threshold corresponded to 12-15 isomerized pigment molecules (R*) in image fields of 800 to 3000 rods. Rod ""dark light"" (intrinsic retinal noise in darkness) corresponded to that estimated previously from single-cell recordings, 0.012 R* s(-1) rod(-1), indicating that spontaneous thermal isomerizations are responsible. Psychophysical rod saturation was measured for the first time in a nonhuman species and found to be very similar to that of the human rod monochromat. Cone threshold corresponded to ~5 R* cone(-1) in an image field of 280 cones. Cone dark light was equivalent to ~5000 R* s(-1) cone(-1), consistent with primate single-cell data but 100-fold higher than predicted by recent measurements of the rate of thermal isomerization of mouse cone opsins, indicating that nonopsin sources of noise determine cone threshold. The new, fully automated behavioral method is based on the ability of mice to learn to interrupt spontaneous wheel running on the presentation of a visual cue and provides an efficient and highly reliable means of examining visual function in naturally behaving normal and mutant mice.",Excluded
1739,"Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms. Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm<sup>3</sup>. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
250,"Toward improved target conformity for two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems using dynamic collimation. Purpose: To quantify improvement in target conformity in brain and head and neck tumor treatments resulting from the use of a dynamic collimation system (DCS) with two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems (universal nozzle, UN, and dedicated nozzle, DN) with median spot sizes of 5.2 and 3.2 mm over a range of energies from 100 to 230 MeV. Method(s): Uncollimated and collimated plans were calculated with both UN and DN beam models implemented within our in-house treatment planning system for five brain and ten head and neck datasets in patients previously treated with spot scanning proton therapy. The prescription dose and beam angles from the clinical plans were used for both the UN and DN plans. The average reduction of the mean dose to the 10-mm ring surrounding the target between the uncollimated and collimated plans was calculated for the UN and the DN. Target conformity was analyzed using the mean dose to 1-mm thickness rings surrounding the target at increasing distances ranging from 1 to 10 mm. Result(s): The average reductions of the 10-mm ring mean dose for the UN and DN plans were 13.7% (95% CI: 11.6%-15.7%; p < 0.0001) and 11.5% (95% CI: 9.5%-13.5%; p < 0.0001) across all brain cases and 7.1% (95% CI: 4.4%-9.8%; p < 0.001) and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7%-9.0%; p < 0.001), respectively, across all head and neck cases. The collimated UN plans were either more conformal (all brain cases and 60% of the head and neck cases) than or equivalent (40% of the head and neck cases) to the uncollimated DN plans. The collimated DN plans offered the highest conformity. Conclusion(s): The DCS added either to the UN or DN improved the target conformity. The DCS may be of particular interest for sites with UN systems looking for a more economical solution than upgrading the nozzle to improve the target conformity of their spot scanning proton therapy system.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no plasmacytosis and although there was a raised CSF protein concentration, no paraprotein band was detected, despite the presence of serum paraprotein. The infiltration of the dura mater is likely to have arisen by spread from contiguous bone lesions, contrasting with the pattern of spread seen in myelomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, which probably occurs through haematogenous seeding of the meninges.

Background Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) may present with single or multi-organ involvement (lung, bone, pituitary gland, skin, lymph). Pulmonary LCH is nearly always associated with smoking and lesions may regress with tobacco cessation, which is considered the initial focus of therapy. Multi-organ LCH is thought to be more aggressive and treatment frequently requires systemic chemotherapy, radiation, or combination therapy. The following case illustrates a patient with multi-organ LCH presenting as a pathologic fracture, and describes simultaneous regression of both lung and bone lesions coinciding with tobacco cessation. Case A 32 year-old female with longstanding tobacco abuse, extensive tuberculosis exposure, prior residence in the California high desert, and family history of BRCA mutation presented following a low-impact fall with T4 vertebral pathologic fracture on MRI. She reported subjective fevers, dyspnea on exertion, and intermittent chest pain for two months prior. Exam was notable for tenderness to palpation over T4 and a papular facial rash. Basic laboratory evaluation was normal, but CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed: innumerable subcentimeter middle/upper lobe-predominant pulmonary nodules, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, ovary with two centimeter cystic structure, and the lytic T4 lesion. Broad differential diagnosis included malignancy, tuberculosis, disseminated fungal disease, and granulomatous disease. Technetium bone scan only revealed the isolated vertebral lesion. PPD and AFB blood cultures were negative. Lumbar puncture and breast/brain MRIs were unrevealing. Coccidiomycosis antibodies, tumor markers, ANA, HIV, hepatitis serologies, SPEP/UPEP, serum quantitative immunoglobulins, and ACE levels were all unremarkable. T4 lesion biopsy was initially thought risky due to aorta proximity, thus bronchoscopy was performed; lavage and transbronchial biopsies were non-diagnostic. Ensuing VATS biopsy specimen revealed bronchiole histiocyte aggregates, eosinophils, and positive CD1a/S100 stains (pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis). While follow-up outpatient vertebral biopsy did not confirm LCH bony involvement, disseminated LCH was assumed given her pathologic fracture. Radiation of the vertebral lesion was considered, but deferred when tobacco cessation over 1.5 years led to near-resolution of pulmonary nodules, regression of vertebral lesion, and diminished symptoms. The patient then began smoking again with subsequent recurrent pulmonary involvement, and a new humeral fracture with biopsy-proven LCH of the bone. Discussion This unique case of LCH demonstrates remission and relapse of multi-organ involvement, correlating temporally with cessation of and subsequent return to tobacco use. This is interesting given that unlike isolated pulmonary disease, the causative role of tobacco and response to smoking avoidance have not been previously described for multi-organ LCH.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The aim was to examine low-level 7 Hz-modulated 450 MHz radiation effects on human performance in visually presented neuropsychological tasks associated with attention and short-term memory.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A homogeneous group of 100 subjects (37 female, 63 male) were randomly assigned to either the exposed (10-20 min, 0.158 mW cm(-2)) or the sham-exposed group. A battery of three different tests measured attention and short-term memory. Task 1 involved alternately selecting black digits from 1 to 25 in ascending order and white digits from 24 to 1 in descending order.

3431,"Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for unilateral thalamotomy in medication refractory essential tremor. Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and is associated with significant functional impairment and disability. Ablative and stimulation-based surgical treatments have been developed to treat the significant number of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management. Although often providing effective tremor control, current surgical options have risks associated with intracranial procedures, as well as issues of durability and predictability of treatment response. Here, we explore the application of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as an alternative, non-invasive means of generating thalamic lesions in patients with treatment-resistant ET. Method(s): Four patients underwent awake MRgFUS thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor (mean age 70.8; mean duration of illness 17.8 years). Diagnosis of refractory ET was confirmed by a movement disorder neurologist, and patients underwent baseline medical and imaging investigations prior to treatment. Tremor assessments and serial structural imaging were performed at 1, 7, 30 and 90 days following the procedure. Result(s): All four patients experienced immediate and sustained improvements in their dominant (treated) hand tremor (Figure 1). At 1- and 3-months following treatment, dominant hand tremor scores were reduced by a mean of 89% and 78%, respectively, on part A of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Functional impairment decreased significantly at 3-months, with patients reporting improvements in writing, drinking and eating. There were no serious adverse events, with only one patient reporting persistent lip and finger paraesthesias at 3-months. Conclusion(s): MRgFUS appears to be a safe and effective means of non-invasively generating thalamic lesions for the relief of refractory ET. This technology is a promising alternative to radiation- and surgical-based approaches to lesional functional neurosurgery, but requires larger trials with more patients to verify its efficacy.

936,"Heterosynaptic co-activation of glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferents is required to induce persistent long-term potentiation. The persistence of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) is thought to require heterosynaptic activation of both glutamate and neuromodulatory receptors in the hippocampus. The present series of experiments contrasts two alternative accounts of heterosynaptic activation. The original version of the synaptic-tag hypothesis of the variable persistence of LTP implied that neuromodulatory and glutamatergic activation could occur independently, albeit within a critical time-window; an alternative view is that there needs to be simultaneous co-activation of both receptors to trigger the up-regulation of relevant protein synthesis (Neuron 34 (2002) 235). Our findings include a replication, over 6 h post-LTP-induction, of earlier findings showing heterosynaptic influences on LTP persistence. Specifically, 'strong' tetanisation with multiple trains of stimulation of one input pathway in a conventional hippocampal slice preparation induces a D1/D5 receptor-dependent form of late-LTP that enables 'weak' tetanic stimulation to induce late-LTP on an independent pathway. However, we also observed that when the first pathway was tetanised in the presence of AP5, not only was no LTP observed on that pathway, but there was also no rescue of late-LTP on the second pathway. Thus, it appears that DA receptors must be co-activated with NMDA receptors in a common pool of neurons to enable LTP persistence, although late-LTP can still be induced by selective activation of glutamatergic synapses if this occurs at time periods shortly before or shortly after this essential coactivation.",Excluded
1642,"Dye-induced photolesion in the mammalian retina: glial and neuronal reactions. Irradiation in the presence of a dye applied to the extracellular space is known to produce degenerative features in irradiated neurones and fibers. In the present study, we confirmed the potential use of this procedure as a lesion technique by showing the removal of degenerating elements as part of the glial reaction to the lesion. The dye Rose Bengal was applied to the vitreous body of a rat eye and a T-shaped irradiation pattern was projected onto the retina within the absorption band of the dye. Degenerative features were restricted to the irradiated area, which could be readily identified from its shape. Retinae examined after various survival times showed that macrophages invaded the damaged area within 1 day, and that mitotic activity of reactive glial cells subsequently occurred in the vicinity of the wound. Both cell types were identified by their structural features. Macrophages were also revealed by a staining technique using the dye Nile Red, whereas reactive glial cells were immunolabeled with an antibody directed against the glial fibrillary acidic protein. Reactive glial cells helped the macrophages to gradually remove injured cells and damaged processes. Their main task, however, appeared to be in scar formation, since their processes seemed to suture the lips of the wound together and restore the limiting membrane at the inner retina. After 2 months' survival time, the parent ganglion cells of most disrupted axon bundles had retrogradely degenerated, but regenerating ganglion cell axons were also observed. These results provide some new data about healing processes in the retina. They demonstrate that the dye-induced photolesion technique can be used to either remove or axotomize selected neurones in neural networks which have been made optically accessible.",Excluded
32,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutant protein activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase in response to ionizing radiation. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder with pleiotropic phenotypes, including neuronal degeneration, immune dysfunction, premature ageing and increased cancer risk. The gene mutated in AT, ATM, encodes a putative lipid or protein kinase. Most of the human AT patient phenotypes are recapitulated in Atm-deficient mice. Cells derived from Atm-/- mice, like those from AT patients, exhibit abnormal response to ionizing radiation. One of the known responses to ionizing radiation is the activation of a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene. Ionizing radiation does not activate c-Abl in cells from AT patients or in thymocytes or fibroblasts from the Atm-deficient mice. Ectopic expression of a functional ATM kinase domain corrects this defect, as it phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro at Ser 465, leading to the activation of c-Abl. A mutant c-Abl with Ser 465 changed to Ala 465 is not activated by ionizing radiation or ATM kinase in vivo. These findings identify the c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a downstream target of phosphorylation and activation by the ATM kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

We show that opsin5 is co-expressed with opsins1 and 2 in Limulus lateral and ventral eye photoreceptors and provide the first evidence that the expression of co-expressed opsins can be differentially regulated. We show that the relative levels of opsin5 and opsin1 and 2 in the rhabdom change with a diurnal rhythm and that their relative levels are also influenced by the animal's central circadian clock. An analysis of the sequence of opsin5 suggests it is sensitive to visible light (400-700 nm) but that its spectral properties may be different from that of opsins1 and 2. Changes in the relative levels of these opsins may underlie some of the dramatic day-night changes in Limulus photoreceptor function and may produce a diurnal change in their spectral sensitivity.",Excluded

2496,"Inclined head position improves dose distribution during hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy using VMAT. PURPOSE: Hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy (HS-WBRT) aims to preserve neurocognitive functions in patients undergoing brain radiotherapy (RT). Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) involves intensity-modulated RT using a coplanar arc. An inclined head position might improve dose distribution during HS-WBRT using VMAT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzed 8 patients receiving brain RT with inclined head positioning. A comparable set of CT images simulating a non-inclined head position was obtained by rotating the original CT set. HS-WBRT plans of coplanar VMAT for each CT set were generated with a prescribed dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Maximum dose to the hippocampi was limited to 16 Gy; to the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and eyeballs this was confined to less than 37.5 Gy; for the lenses to 8 Gy. Dosimetric parameters of the two different plans of 8 patients were compared with paired t-test.RESULTS: Mean inclined head angle was 11.09 +/- 0.73degree. The homogeneity (HI) and conformity (CI) indexes demonstrated improved results, with an average 8.4 +/- 10.0 % (p = 0.041) and 5.3 +/- 3.9 % (p = 0.005) reduction, respectively, in the inclined vs. non-inclined position. The inclined head position had lower hippocampi Dmin (10.45 +/- 0.36 Gy), Dmax (13.70 +/- 0.25 Gy), and Dmean (12.01 +/- 0.38 Gy) values vs. the non-inclined head position (Dmin = 12.07 +/- 1.07 Gy; Dmax = 15.70 +/- 1.25 Gy; Dmean = 13.91 +/- 1.01 Gy), with 12.8 +/- 8.9 % (p = 0.007), 12.2 +/- 6.8 % (p = 0.003), and 13.2 +/- 7.2 % (p = 0.002) reductions, respectively. Mean Dmax for the lenses was 6.34 +/- 0.72 Gy and 7.60 +/- 0.46 Gy, respectively, with a 16.3 +/- 10.8 % reduction in the inclined position (p = 0.004). Dmax for the optic nerve and Dmean for the eyeballs also decreased by 7.0 +/- 5.9 % (p = 0.015) and 8.4 +/- 7.2 % (p = 0.015), respectively.CONCLUSION: Inclining the head position to approximately 11degree during HS-WBRT using VMAT improved dose distribution in the planning target volume and allowed lower doses to the hippocampi and optic apparatus.",Excluded

741,"Re-evaluation of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matched analysis. We attempted to re-evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) with more recent data. A total of 179 patients with LS-SCLC received radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy at our institution between 1998 and 2018. One hundred twenty-eight patients who achieved complete response (CR), good partial response (PR), and PR without progression for at least for one year after initial therapy were enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into a PCI group (group A, n=43), and a non-PCI group (group B, n=85). Survival outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Because several background factors differed significantly between groups A and B, propensity score (PS) matching was performed as 1:1 match of the two groups. Finally, we analyzed 64 patients (group A/B=32/32). Median follow-up periods were 53 and 31 months in groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups' backgrounds. Two-year overall survival (OS) rates were 77% in group A and 62% in group B (p=0.224). Two-year brain metastasis free survival (BMFS) rates were 85% in group A and 57% in group B (p=0.008). The number of patients who underwent a brain imaging test for confirmation of no brain metastasis (BM) after radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy (before PCI) was 84 (group A/B=32/52). A PS matched analysis for cases of pre-PCI brain imaging group, two-year OS rates for group A/B were 73/59% (p=0.446). Two-year BMFS rates for group A/B were 91/52% (p=0.021). Retrospectively, PS matched analysis revealed that adding PCI to LS-SCLC patients who achieved good thoracic control significantly improved BMFS, but OS did not improve.

352,"Tumor treating fields: A novel therapy for glioblastoma multiforme. Learning Objectives: To describe the rationale, indications, and literature supporting the use of Tumor Treating Fields in the first-line and second-line settings for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Main: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a novel anti-neoplastic treatment recently approved for clinical use for GBM. This new modality utilizes low intensity, intermediate frequency alternating electrical fields that have demonstrated anti-neoplastic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. The mechanism of action is postulated to include mitotic disruption at various points including dipole misalignment, impaired microtubule assembly, dielectrophoresis of intra-cellular molecules and organelle disruption, and asymmetric chromosome segregation. TTfields is delivered continuously to the brain by a patient-operated, wearable medical device (OptuneTM, Novocure Ltd.). A large (695 patients enrolled), international, randomized, phase 3 trial has recently confirmed the long-term efficacy of adding TTFields to standard maintenance chemotherapy after the completion of chemo-irradiation in newly diagnosed GBM. At 5-year follow-up, this trial demonstrated consistent superior tumor control (median PFS 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p = 0.00005) and significantly improved survival (median OS 20.9 vs. 16 months, 5-year OS 13% vs. 5%, p = 0.00006) with the addition of TTFields to the current standard of care therapy. The magnitude of improvement when adding TTFields is comparable to the benefit observed with adding chemotherapy to radiation (demonstrated over a decade ago). There was no significant toxicity observed with TTfields (most commonly, mild dermatitis), and patient-reported quality of life was unaffected. On subset analysis, both MGMT hypermethylation-positive and negative tumor subtypes were found to significantly benefit from TTF. In the second-line setting, a prior phase III trial has demonstrated equal efficacy but improved toxicity and quality of life profiles as compared to physician's choice of 2nd-line chemotherapy in GBM progressing after standard therapy. TTF is now endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for both the 1st line and 2nd-line setting in the treatment of GBM.",Excluded
2848,"Paraventricular hypothalamic influences on spinal nociceptive processing. Oxytocin properties have been studied in different experimental models in order to obtain evidence for its analgesic properties. The analgesic effect of an oxytocinergic pathway descending from the hypothalamus reaching the dorsal horn of the spinal cord has been studied. In anesthetized rats, we recorded single units at the L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn level and stimulated the peripheral receptive field. The evoked responses were classified according to their latencies in A-beta, A-delta, C fibers, and postdischarge. We used these responses to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus (PV) of the hypothalamus. We observed a selective blockage of A-delta and C fibers related to the duration of the train stimulus duration. Similar effects were observed when oxytocin (OT) was applied directly on the spinal cord. The effects of OT and of PV electrical stimulation were reversed in a dose-dependent manner by application of the specific OT antagonist (OTA). These effects were observed in cells with reduced wind-up and cells displaying a clear wind-up response to peripheral stimulation. Superficial and deeper cells in the dorsal spinal cord were involved. The recorded cells were marked by pontamine blue iontophoretic injection after each cell recording, and their histological locations were specified. In order to obtain a behavioral correlation, we used rats with a loose ligature of the sciatic nerve and a chronic intrathecal catheter reaching the L4-L5 spinal cord level. We tested the hyperalgesia and allodynia of these animals using von Frey filaments and the application of acetone to the hind paws. Our results show a significant reduction in the mechanical and thermal test after the administration of 15 microl of 10(-6) M OT. Our electrophysiological, pharmacological, and behavioral results point out a clear OT antialgesic effect. The results are discussed on the basis of a previous work showing an OT blockage of glutamate activation. The paraventricular hypothalamic descending OT pathway is proposed as an interesting mechanism producing analgesia.",Excluded
1857,"Magnetic-resonance imaging for kinetic analysis of permeability changes during focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening and brain drug delivery. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with the presence of microbubbles has been shown to induce transient and local opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the delivery of therapeutic molecules which normally cannot penetrate into the brain. The success of FUS brain-drug delivery relies on its integration with in-vivo imaging to monitor kinetic change of therapeutic molecules into the brain. In this study, we developed a dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique for kinetic analysis of delivered molecules during FUS-BBB opening. Three kinetic parameters (K<inf>trans</inf>, V<inf>e</inf>, K<inf>ep</inf>) were characterized dynamically to describe BBB-permeability at two FUS exposure conditions (0.4 or 0.8 MPa) over 24 h. K<inf>trans</inf>, defined as the influx volume transfer constant from plasma to EES, and V<inf>e</inf>, the EES volume fraction, were both found to be pressure-dependent. K<inf>trans</inf> and V<inf>e</inf> showed a peak increase of 0.0086-0.0131 min<sup>- 1</sup> (for 0.4-0.8 MPa pressure), and 0.0431-0.0692, respectively, immediately after FUS exposure. Both parameters subsequently decreased exponentially as a function of time, with estimated half-lives of decay of 2.89-5.3 and 2.2-4.93 h, respectively. The kinetics of K<inf>ep</inf>, defined as the efflux rate constant from the extracellular extravascular space (EES) to the plasma, were complementary to K <inf>trans</inf>, with an initial decrease from 0.2010 to 0.1901 min <sup>- 1</sup> followed by a significantly longer recovery time (half-life of 17.39-99.92 h). Our observations strongly supported the existence of imbalanced and mismatched kinetics of influx (K<inf>trans</inf>) and efflux (K <inf>ep</inf>) between the plasma and EES, indicating the existence of directional permeability during FUS-BBB opening. We further showed that kinetic change determined by DCE-MRI correlated well with the concentration of Evans Blue (EB)-albumin (coefficient of 0.74-0.89). These findings suggest that MRI kinetic monitoring may serve as an alternative method for in-vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) change of therapeutic agents during drug delivery to the brain, and provide useful information for future optimization of FUS-BBB opening. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3517,"Thermoregulation in pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana, Ord) in winter. Conservation of energy is a prerequisite thermoregulatory strategy for survival in northern hemisphere winters. We have used thermistor/data logger assemblies to measure temperatures in the brain, carotid artery, jugular vein and abdominal cavity, in pronghorn antelope to determine their winter body temperature and to investigate whether the carotid rete has a survival role. Over the study period mean black globe and air temperature were -0.5+/-3.2 degrees C and -2.0+/-3.4 degrees C, respectively, and mean daytime solar radiation was approximately 186 W m(-2). Brain temperature (T(brain), 39.3+/-0.3 degrees C) was higher than carotid blood temperature (T(carotid), 38.5+/-0.4 degrees C), and higher than jugular temperature (T(jugular), 37.9+/-0.7 degrees C). Minimum T(brain) (38.5+/-0.4 degrees C) and T(carotid) (37.8+/-0.2 degrees C) in winter were higher than the minimum T(brain) (37.7+/-0.5 degrees C) and T(carotid) (36.4+/-0.8 degrees C) in summer that we have reported previously. Compared with summer, winter body temperature patterns were characterized by an absence of selective brain cooling (SBC), a higher range of T(brain), a range of T(carotid) that was significantly narrower (1.8 degrees C) than in summer (3.1 degrees C), and changes in T(carotid) and T(brain) that were more highly correlated (r=0.99 in winter vs r=0.83 in summer). These findings suggest that in winter the effects of the carotid rete are reduced, which eliminates SBC and prevents independent regulation of T(brain), thus coupling T(brain) to T(carotid). The net effect is that T(carotid) varies little. A possible consequence is depression of metabolism, with the survival advantage of conservation of energy. These findings also suggest that the carotid rete has wider thermoregulatory effects than its traditional SBC function.",Excluded
21,"Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery for resected brain metastases: A comparison of outcomes for large resection cavities. PURPOSE: Although historical trials have established the role of surgical resection followed by whole brain irradiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, WBRT has recently been shown to cause significant neurocognitive decline. Many practitioners have employed postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to tumor resection cavities to increase local control without causing significant neurocognitive sequelae. However, studies analyzing outcomes of large brain metastases treated with resection and postoperative SRS are lacking. Here we compare outcomes in patients with large brain metastases >4 cm to those with smaller metastases <=4 cm treated with surgical resection followed by SRS to the resection cavity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with brain metastases treated at our institution with surgical resection and postoperative SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts based on preoperative maximal tumor dimension. Cumulative incidence of local failure, radiation necrosis, and death were analyzed for the 2 cohorts using a competing-risk model, defined as the time from SRS treatment date to the measured event, death, or last follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive cases were identified. Of these patients, 90 (77%) had preoperative tumors <=4 cm, and 27 (23%) >4 cm in greatest dimension. The only significant baseline difference between the 2 groups was a higher proportion of patients who underwent gross total resection in the <=4 cm compared with the >4 cm cohort, 76% versus 48%, respectively (P <.01). The 1-year rates of local failure, radiation necrosis, and overall survival for the <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts were 12.3% and 16.0%, 26.9% and 28.4%, and 80.6% and 67.6%, respectively (all P >.05). The rates of local failure and radiation necrosis were not statistically different on multivariable analysis based on tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases >4 cm in largest dimension managed by resection and radiosurgery to the tumor cavity have promising local control rates without a significant increase in radiation necrosis on our retrospective review.",Excluded
2351,"Response characterstics of spinothalamic tract neurons that project to the posterior thalamus in rats. A sizeable number of spinothalamic tract axons terminate in the posterior thalamus. The functional roles and precise areas of termination of these axons have been a subject of recent controversy. The goals of this study were to identify spinothalamic tract neurons (STT) within the cervical enlargement that project to this area, characterize their responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of their receptive fields, and use microantidromic tracking methods to determine the nuclei in which their axons terminate. Forty-seven neurons were antidromically activated using low-amplitude (< or =30 microA) current pulses in the contralateral posterior thalamus. The 51 points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were surrounded by ineffective tracks indicating that the surrounded axons terminated within the posterior thalamus. The areas of termination were located primarily in the posterior triangular, medial geniculate, posterior and posterior intralaminar, and suprageniculate nuclei. Recording points were located in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. The mean antidromic conduction velocity was 6.4 m/s, a conduction velocity slower than that of other projections to the thalamus or hypothalamus in rats. Cutaneous receptive fields appeared to be smaller than those of neurons projecting to other areas of the thalamus or to the hypothalamus. Each of the examined neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the STT carries nociceptive information to several target nuclei within the posterior thalamus. We discuss the evidence that this projection provides nociceptive information that plays an important role in fear conditioning.",Excluded

Neural and systemic somatotrophic effects of the ultraviolet component of sunlight through the skin-vitamin D endocrine system are considered as alternate or additional to the neuroendocrine effects of the visual component of light through the retino-diencephalic input. The extensive distribution of soltriol nuclear receptor cells, revealed by autoradiography with tritium-labeled 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D, soltriol) and related effects, indicate an involvement of vitamin D-soltriol in the actinic induction of seasonal biorhythms. This is considered to be independent of the traditionally assigned effects of vitamin D on systemic calcium regulation. Skin-soltriol mediated seasonal, and to a degree daily, genomic activation involves many target regions in the brain. These include neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala, in the linked part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, in periventricular hypothalamic neurons, dorsal raphe nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus and autonomic, endocrine as well as sensory and motor components of the brainstem and spinal cord. Additional to the eye-regulated ""suprachiasmatic clock"", existence of a soltriol-vitamin D regulated neural ""timing circuit(s)"" is proposed. Both, activational and organizational effects of soltriol on mature and developing brain regions, respectively are likely to play a role in the regulation of neuronal functions that include the modulation and entrainment of biorhythms. Soltriol's central effects correlate with peripheral effects on elements in skin, bone, teeth, kidney, intestine, heart and blood vessels, endocrine organs, and tissues of the immune and reproductive system.

2076,"Fine-tuning of intrinsic N-Oct-3 POU domain allostery by regulatory DNA targets. The 'POU' (acronym of Pit-1, Oct-1, Unc-86) family of transcription factors share a common DNA-binding domain of approximately 160 residues, comprising so-called 'POUs' and 'POUh' sub-domains connected by a flexible linker. The importance of POU proteins as developmental regulators and tumor-promoting agents is due to linker flexibility, which allows them to adapt to a considerable variety of DNA targets. However, because of this flexibility, it has not been possible to determine the Oct-1/Pit-1 linker structure in crystallographic POU/DNA complexes. We have previously shown that the neuronal POU protein N-Oct-3 linker contains a structured region. Here, we have used a combination of hydrodynamic methods, DNA footprinting experiments, molecular modeling and small angle X-ray scattering to (i) structurally interpret the N-Oct-3-binding site within the HLA DRalpha gene promoter and deduce from this a novel POU domain allosteric conformation and (ii) analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in conformational transitions. We conclude that there might exist a continuum running from free to 'pre-bound' N-Oct-3 POU conformations and that regulatory DNA regions likely select pre-existing conformers, in addition to molding the appropriate DBD structure. Finally, we suggest that a specific pair of glycine residues in the linker might act as a major conformational switch. © 2007 The Author(s).",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of an 80-kVp protocol using a moderate concentration contrast material (MC-CM) for cerebral computed tomography angiography by comparison with a conventional 120-kVp protocol using a high concentration contrast material (HC-CM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Attenuation values and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were determined in a head phantom for 2 tube voltages (80 and 120 kVp) and 2 different iodine concentration contrast materials (HC-CM and MC-CM). Among 90 consecutive patients, 45 patients were scanned with 120 kVp and 150 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of HC-CM (370 mg iodine [mgI]/mL), whereas the other 45 patients were scanned with 80 kVp and 370 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of MC-CM (300 mgI/mL). The Hounsfield units (HU) of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), subjective degree of arterial enhancement, image noise, sharpness of the cerebral arterial boundary, and overall diagnostic image quality were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, and CNR was significantly higher in the 80 kVp with MC-CM group (379.2, 33.7, and 31.1 HU, respectively) than in the 120 kVp with HC-CM group (282.2, 31.1, and 27.2 HU, respectively).

PURPOSE: Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) results can be affected by an atypical retardation pattern (ARP). One reason for an ARP is the birefringence of the sclera. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the peripapillary choroidal thickness (pChTh) on the occurrence of ARP.METHODS: One hundred ten healthy subjects were investigated with SLP and spectral domain OCT. pChTh was measured in B-scan images at 768 positions using semiautomatic software. Values were averaged to 32 sectors and the total peripapillary mean. Subjects were divided into four groups according to the typical scan score (TSS) provided by the GDxVCC: group 1 TSS, 100; group 2 TSS, 90-99; group 3 TSS, 80-89; group 4 TSS, <80.RESULTS: Mean pChTh (+/- SD) in 110 healthy subjects was 141 mum (+/-49 mum). There was a significant correlation between pChTh and TSS (r = 0.608; P < 0.001). In TSS groups 1 to 4, mean pChTh was 168 mum (+/-38 mum), 148 mum (+/- 48 mum), 119 mum (+/-35 mum), and 92 (+/-42 mum).

Several studies have shown that low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) could affect the differentiation and proliferation of MSCs. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of LLLI at different energy densities on BMSCs differentiation into neuron and osteoblast. Human BMSCs were cultured and induced to differentiate to either neuron or osteoblast in the absence or presence of LLLI. Gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) laser irradiation (810 nm) was applied at days and of differentiation process at energy densities of 3 or 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for BMSCs being induced to neurons, and 2 or 4 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for BMSCs being induced to osteoblasts. BMSCs proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay on the seventh day of differentiation. BMSCs differentiation to neurons was assessed by immunocytochemical analysis of neuron-specific enolase on the seventh day of differentiation. BMSCs differentiation to osteoblastwas tested on the second, fifth, seventh and tenth day of differentiation via analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. LLLI promoted BMSCs proliferation significantly at all energy densities except for 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> in comparison to control groups on the seventh day of differentiation. LLLI at energy densities of 3 and 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> dramatically facilitated the differentiation of BMSCs into neurons (p<.001). Also, ALP activity was significantly enhanced in irradiated BMSCs differentiated to osteoblast on the second, fifth, seventh, and tenth day of differentiation (p<0.001 except for the second day). Using LLLI at 810 nm wavelength enhances BMSCs differentiation into neuron and osteoblast in the range of 2-6 J/cm <sup>2</sup>, and at the same time increases BMSCs proliferation (except for 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The effect of LLLI on differentiation and proliferation of BMSCs is dose-dependent.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of psPD following RT/TMZ and the effect of psPD on prognosis.MATERIALS/METHODS: All patients receiving RT/TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a prospective database. Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis.

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity. © 2014 Zhou, Wang, Rao, Liang, Chen, Zheng, Tan, Tian, Wang, Bai, Chen and Li.",Excluded

This technique was implemented in our institute within the context of our participation in the 'Hippocampal Avoidance Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation' clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01780675). In this phase III multicentre trial patients with small cell lung cancer are randomised to receive Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) with or without Hippocampal Avoidance (HA). Material(s) and Method(s): The Hippocampal Avoidance Zone is defined as both hippocampi (left and right) extended with a margin of 5 mm. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) is defined as the brain extended with a margin of 4 mm minus the Hippocampal Avoidance Zone. The goal was to deliver 25 Gy to at least 95% of the PTV in 10 fractions, while sparing the hippocampi (mean dose < 8.5 Gy; max dose < 10 Gy) and eye lenses (max dose < 10 Gy). A coplanar VMAT technique with two dual arcs was planned using Pinnacle3 v9.8 (Philips). Overnight optimization was performed using a homemade script to repeat SmartArc optimizations at a 3mm dose grid until no further decrease in cost function was obtained. For this study, HA-PCI treatment plans with a controlpoint-spacing (CPS) of 4degree as well as 2degree were created for 7 patients. Subsequently, the plans were delivered on an Elekta linac with an Agility MLC (5mm leaves). Pre-treatment delivery-QA was performed by measuring the dose distribution using a cylindrical diodearray phantom (Delta4, ScandiDos). The measured dose distributions were compared to the TPS calculations using a 4%/2mm gamma criterion, aiming for a pass rate >95%. Planning parameters as well as QA measurement results were compared for the 4degree and 2degree plans. Result(s): The dose distribution of a typical HA-PCI treatment plan is shown in Figure 1. Planning parameters and QA measurement results of the 4o and 2o CPS plans for 7 patients are shown in Table 1. All plans achieved a homogeneous coverage of the PTV, while the objectives and constraints as defined in the study protocol were accomplished. QA measurements for the treatment plans with a CPS of 4degree showed better agreement with the TPS calculations than the 2degree CPS plans, with an average pass rate of 95.4% at a 4%/2mm gamma criterion (range 91.5 - 99.1%). Figure 1: Dose distribution of a clinical Hippocampal Avoidance Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation treatment plan, showing suitable coverage of the PTV (red colorwash) by the 95% isodose level (23.75 Gy, thick yellow line), without high dose regions exceeding 110% (27.50 Gy), and adequate sparing of both hippocampi (green colorwash) at a dose level below 10 Gy (light blue isodose-line).

The interactions of mutant alleles that individually confer radiation sensitivity in Neurospora crassa are being studied with regard to their effects on radiation-induced inactivation and forward-mutation induction at the ad-3 loci. This paper reports attempts to construct 3 double-mutant strains containing the following pair-wise combinations of repair-deficient mutants: upr-1,uvs-2; uvs-2,uvs-6; and uvs-3,uvs-6. The double-mutant strain with the 2 excision-repair-deficient mutants upr-1 and uvs-2 shows increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced mutagenesis and inactivation, relative to that shown by either of the parental single-mutant strains. This double mutant is no more sensitive than the parental single-mutant strains to either UV mutagenesis or inactivation. The combination of the uvs-2 and uvs-6 double-mutant strain is considerably more sensitive to both UV and X-ray inactivation than either the uvs-2 or uvs-6 strain, but it shows no greater sensitivity than the parental strains to ad-3 mutation induction by either agent. The combination of the uvs-3 and uvs-6 alleles is inviable. Tetrad analysis and microscopical examination of ascospores shows that ascospores of presumptive genotype uvs-3, uvs-6 do not grow beyond the formation of a few hyphal threads. The lethal and mutagenic effects of UV and X-irradiation in these double-mutant strains are interpreted in terms of the repair systems in Neurospora and other microorganisms.",Excluded
1728,"Risk factors of brain metastases as initial failure for completely resected stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Brain metastasis (BM) is the main sign of failure of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The lymph node (LN) status is a major determinant of outcome in patients with NSCLC, but whether or not the LN status is a major determinant of BM remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on completely resected staged IIIA (N2) LA-NSCLC to explore the correlation between LN status and BM. We also aimed to identify the risk factors of BM as the initial site of failure, as well as the potential highest-risk candidates who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Materials/Methods: The medical records of 357 consecutive patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who underwent complete surgery were reviewed between January 2005 and June 2012. Time to BM as the initial site of failure was measured from the date of surgery to the date of BM in the patients who developed distant metastases or both local and distant recurrence as the initial failure, with BM defined as an event. The cumulative incidence of BM as the initial site of failure and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. To assess the risk factors of BM, the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis. Result(s): A total of 73 (20.4%) patients developed BM, and 60 patients had BM as their initial site of failure. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year risks for patients developing BM as the initial site of failure were 9.1%, 27.4%, and 35.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.000), positive extra-capsular extension of LN metastasis (P=0.041), number of metastatic LN > 4 (P = 0.018), multiple N2 stations (P = 0.027), and multiple regions of mediastinal LN (MLN) involvement (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing BM as the initial site of failure. Multivariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.002; HR = 5.148; 95% CI = 1.863-14.222) and multiple regions of MLN involvement (P = 0.015; HR = 0.556; 95% CI = 0.326-0.948) were significantly associated with the high risk of BM as the initial site of failure. In patients with nonsquamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement, the fiveyear actuarial risk of BM as the initial failure was 47.6%. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement were independent risk factors for BM as the initial failure in completely resected IIIA (N2) NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement are at the highest risk of developing BM as the initial failure, and may receive a greater benefit from PCI. Prospective clinical trials are needed to verify the effect of PCI in the highest-risk subgroup we identified.",Excluded
2732,"Imaging neuronal pathways with 52Mn PET in rats. Objectives: We aimed at applying <sup>52</sup>Mn for PET imaging of neuronal pathways in rats, and testing potential toxicity of the tracer to the dopaminergic neurons. Method(s): <sup>52</sup>Mn was produced by proton irradiation of natCr. We have elaborated the purification procedure and the tracer was prepared for intracerebral administration in Na ascorbate-buffered saline. Rats were stereotactically injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or striatum (STR) with app. 170kBq and scanned 24 h later. Behavioral (rotameter test) and histological (TH-staining) evaluation was performed after 4 weeks. Another group of rats was injected with a reduced radioactivity dose and the same toxicity evaluation took place at three time points. The influence of the radiation dose on the DNA integrity was tested with gH2AX-staining in a separate experiment. Finally, gradual transport of <sup>52</sup>Mn along the dopaminergic pathways was imaged continuously for 6 h in additional animals. Result(s): <sup>52</sup>Mn transport along the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways was clearly visible in PET images of the VTA-injected rats, as well as along the striatonigral tracts following the intrastriatal administration. Quantitative analysis of the PET data confirmed the tracer distribution in expected brain regions. Impaired motor control and dopaminergic lesion were found in some animals treated with the high radioactivity dose. This effect was completely abolished by reducing the dose to 20+/-5 kBq. There was also no increase in the double strand DNA breaks in the brain tissues treated with the lower dose as compared to the controls. Gradual <sup>52</sup>Mn transport along the mesolimbic pathway could be observed in dynamic PET images. Conclusion(s): <sup>52</sup>Mn traces neuronal pathways which can be imaged with PET. The optimized experimental protocol prevents lesioning dopaminergic neurons and affecting the rotation behavior up to 4 weeks post-injection in rats. Stages of the progressive movement of the tracer along the dopaminergic pathway can be visualize.",Excluded
2839,"Temporal patterning of saccadic eye movement signals. Electrical microstimulation is used widely in experimental neurophysiology to examine causal links between specific brain areas and their behavioral functions and is used clinically to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders in patients. Typically, microstimulation is applied to local brain regions as a train of equally spaced current pulses. We were interested in the sensitivity of a neural circuit to a train of variably spaced pulses, as is observed in physiological spike trains. We compared the effect of fixed, decelerating, accelerating, and randomly varying microstimulation patterns on the likelihood and metrics of eye movements evoked from the frontal eye field of monkeys, while holding the mean interpulse interval constant. Our results demonstrate that the pattern of microstimulation pulses strongly influences the probability of evoking a saccade, as well as the metrics of the saccades themselves. Specifically, the pattern most closely resembling physiological spike trains (accelerating pattern) was most effective at evoking a saccade, three times more so than the least effective decelerating pattern. A saccade-triggered average of effective random trains confirmed the positive relationship between accelerating rate and efficacy. These results have important implications for the use of electrical microstimulation in both experimental and clinical settings and suggest a means to study the role of temporal pattern in the encoding of behavioral and cognitive functions.",Excluded
1724,"Potential biological indicators of multi-organ damage: Application to radiation accident victims. [French]. Accidental irradiations induce a complex pathological situation, difficult to assess and to treat. However, recent results describing new biological indicators of radiation-induced damages such as Flt3-ligand, citrulline and oxysterol concentration in the plasma, together with results obtained in large animal models of high dose irradiation, allowed a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms induced by uncontrolled irradiations. This conducted to leave the classical paradigm of the acute radiation syndrome, described as the association of three individual syndromes, the hematopoietic syndrome, the gastro-intestinal syndrome and the cerebrovascular syndrome, in favour of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, with the implication of other organs and systems. Follow-up of victims from two recent radiation accidents brings a confirmation of the usefulness of the newly described biological indicators, and also a partial confirmation of this new concept of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

2237,"A machine learning-based survival prediction model of high grade glioma by integration of clinical and dose-volume histogram parameters. Purpose: Glioma is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults, and it causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially in high-grade glioma (HGG) patients. The accurate prognostic prediction of HGG is vital and helpful for clinicians when developing therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we propose a machine learning-based survival prediction model by analyzing clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, to improve the performance of the risk model in HGG patients. Method(s): Eight clinical variables and 39 DVH parameters were extracted for each patient, who received radiotherapy for HGG with active follow-up. Ninety-five patients were randomly divided into training and testing cohorts, and we employed random survival forest (RSF), support vector machine (SVM), and Cox proportional hazards (CPHs) models to predict survival. Calibration plots, concordance indexes, and decision curve analyses were used to evaluate the calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility of these three models. Result(s): The RSF model showed the best performance among the three models, with concordance indexes of 0.824 and 0.847 in the training and testing sets, respectively, followed by the SVM (0.792/0.823) and CPH (0.821/0.811) models. Specifically, in the RSF model, we identified age, gross tumor volume (GTV), grade, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and D99 as important variables associated with survival. The AUCs of the testing set were 92.4%, 87.7%, and 84.0% for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival, respectively. According to this model, HGG patients can be divided into high- and low-risk groups. Conclusion(s): The machine learning-based RSF model integrating both clinical and DVH variables is an improved and useful tool for predicting the survival of HGG patients.

268,"Differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in high-grade gliomas: assessing the efficacy of 18F-FDG PET, 11C-methionine PET and perfusion MRI. PURPOSE: The authors analyzed the characteristics of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and (11)C-methionine (MET) PET to compare the efficacies of these modalities in making the distinction between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence of high-grade glioma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were evaluated with dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI, (11)C-MET PET and (18)F-FDG PET to visualize gadolinium-enhanced lesions during the post-radiation follow-up period. In the perfusion MRI, four regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and average values were calculated. A reference ROI of the same size was defined in the contralateral white matter to obtain the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). After coregistering the PET images with the MRI, we measured the maximum uptake values of the lesion and of the contralateral cerebral white matter as reference area to calculate the L(max)/R(max) ratio.RESULTS: The rCBV was higher in the recurrence group than in the necrosis group (p=0.010). There was no difference between groups in terms of the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from the (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET.CONCLUSION: A quantitative rCBV as calculated from a perfusion MRI scan might be superior to the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET in order to distinguish a recurrence of high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) for occlusion of subretinal neovascular membranes, the authors studied efficiency and collateral damage of PDT-induced photothrombosis in the rabbit choriocapillary layer.METHOD: Benzoporphyrin derivative, a new photosensitizer, currently in clinical trials for tumor therapy, was used. Low-density lipoprotein served as a carrier to enhance selective targeting of vascular endothelial cells.RESULTS: Complete choriocapillary occlusion was achieved at a BPD dose of 2 mg/kg and a radiant exposure as low as 10 J/cm2. When PDT was performed 3 hours after BPD application, damage to the neural retina was minimal. Only inner photoreceptor segments showed mitochondrial swelling probably secondary to choroidal ischemia. Bruch's membrane remained intact. Retinal pigment epithelium was invariably damaged as seen with other photosensitizers.CONCLUSION: Compared with photocoagulation BPD-PDT allows endothelial-bound intraluminal photothrombosis, sparing important structures such as neural retina and Bruch's membrane. It may thus provide a more selective treatment of juxtafoveal and subfoveal neovascular membranes.",Excluded
3537,"Changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter and in efficacy of release induced by high-frequency firing at Aplysia sensorimotor synapses in culture. Synaptic transmission at the sensory neuron-motor neuron synapses of Aplysia, like transmission at many synapses of both vertebrates and invertebrates, is increased after a short burst of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), a phenomenon known as posttetanic potentiation (PTP). PTP is generally attributable to an increase in transmitter release from presynaptic neurons. We investigated whether changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter (RRP) contribute to the potentiation that follows HFS. We compared the changes in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked with action potentials to changes in the RRP as estimated from the asynchronous transmitter release elicited by a hypertonic solution. The changes in the EPSP were correlated with changes in the RRP, but the changes matched quantitatively only at connections whose initial synaptic strength was greater than the median for all experiments. At weaker connections, the increase in the RRP was insufficient to account for PTP. Weaker connections initially released a smaller fraction of the RRP with each EPSP than stronger ones, and this fraction increased at weaker connections after HFS. Moreover, the initial transmitter release in response to the hypertonic solution was accelerated after HFS, indicating that the increase in the efficacy of release was not restricted to excitation-secretion coupling. Modulation of the RRP and of the efficacy of release thus both contribute to the enhancement of transmitter release by HFS.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology. Given the cost and radiation exposure associated with CT, imaging should be reserved for patients with significant symptoms or focal findings on neurological examination.",Excluded
621,"Possible fractionated regimens for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy of large arteriovenous malformations. The aim of this study was to estimate a plausible alpha/beta ratio for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) based on reported clinical data, and to design possible fractionation regimens suitable for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) for large AVMs based on the newly obtained alpha/beta ratio. The commonly used obliteration rate (OR) for AVMs with a three year angiographic follow-up from many institutes was fitted to linear-quadratic (LQ) formalism and the Poisson OR model. The determined parameters were then used to calculate possible fractionation regimens for IG-IMRT based on the concept of a biologically effective dose (BED) and an equivalent uniform dose (EUD). The radiobiological analysis yields a alpha/beta ratio of 2.2 +/- 1.6 Gy for AVMs. Three sets of possible fractionated schemes were designed to achieve equal or better biological effectiveness than the single-fraction treatments while maintaining the same probability of normal brain complications. A plausible alpha/beta ratio was derived for AVMs and possible fractionation regimens that may be suitable for IG-IMRT for large AVM treatment are proposed. The sensitivity of parameters on the calculation was also studied. The information may be useful to design new clinical trials that use IG-IMRT for the treatment of large AVMs. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Excluded

448,"A randomized phase II clinical trial of whole-brain radiation therapy plus concomitant temozolomide in treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer: Six-month follow-up results. Background: Despite of therapeutics progress in advanced breast cancer, brain metastases occurrence remain a frequent and delicate situation. The efficacy of whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), still considered as the standard local treatment in case of multiple brain metastases, is limited. Recently, several phase II studies have shown some efficacy of the association of WBRT and temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent already known as a radiosensitizer, with improved brain control rate (44 to 96%). Patients with breast cancer were underrepresented and none of these trials have studied this combined treatment issue in this specific population. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of WBRT combined with temozolomide in the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective randomized multicenter phase II study was developed, using a modified two-stage Fleming design. Patients with newly diagnosed intraparenchymal brain metastases from breast cancer, not suitable for surgery nor radiosurgery, were included. All patients received conformational WBRT (3 Gy x 10 to 30 Gy). They were randomized to WBRT plus concomitant TMZ administered 75 mg/m2/day during radiation period versus WBRT alone. The primary endpoint was radiologic objective response at six weeks after the end of treatment, defined as a partial or complete response on systematic brain MRI (WHO modified criteria). We also evaluated neurologic symptoms, tolerance, safety, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. A longer clinical-brain MRI follow-up was planned, each three months during a two-year period. All of the patients gave their written informed consent to be part of the study, which was approved by the local committee. Result(s): One hundred patients were enrolled between February 2008 and December 2010 (50 in the WBRT + TMZ arm, 50 in the WBRT arm). The median age was 55 [29 -79]. Eighty (80) patients had brain metastases as single secondary localization. About one third of patients had a triple negative breast cancer subtype (38,3% in the association arm and 35,71% in the WBRT alone arm). There were 26,7% and 14,6% of HER2 positive subtype respectively. The median follow-up was 30 months [range 6-60]. At six months from brain metastases diagnosis (three months after the end of the treatment), objective response rate seems better in the WBRT + TMZ arm: 52% versus 40% in the arm WBRT alone but was not statistically significant (p = 0,54). No complete response was observed. In the WBRT + TMZ group, median PFS and OS at six-months were respectively 55,6% [range 46-7 - 66,0] and 67,7% [range 59,1 - 77,6]. No improvement in neurologic symptoms was noticed. In multivariate analysis, initial TNM status was significantly correlated with PFS and OS. The concurrent use of TMZ with WBRT was well-tolerated. The most frequent upper grade II acute toxicity was reversible leucopenia in the association arm. Conclusion(s): The addition of temozolomide to WBRT in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer did not improve local control or survival at six months follow-up.",Excluded
853,"Taste loss and recovery following radiation therapy. Previous investigators have reported deficits in taste acuity in patients following radiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancer. In the present longitudinal study, 13 patients (mean age = 51.6 yrs) received conventional or hyperfractionated radiotherapy (63-76.8 Gy) for primary tumors of the oropharynx. One or both parotid glands and at least two-thirds of the tongue were included in the radiation field. Smell recognition and taste detection thresholds were determined at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year post-radiation. Differences for smell recognition and the 4 taste qualities were assessed (independently) at the 4 time intervals, with a one-way ANOVA. Smell recognition was unaffected by radiation. There were significant elevations in thresholds for sweet (p < 0.005), salty (p < 0.005), bitter (p < 0.005), and sour (p< 0.001) during radiation therapy that were restored to baseline levels at 6 months and 1 year after radiation.

3245,"On glioblastoma and the search for a cure: where do we stand?. Although brain tumours have been documented and recorded since the nineteenth century, 2016 marked 90 years since Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing coined the term ""glioblastoma multiforme"". Since that time, although extensive developments in diagnosis and treatment have been made, relatively little improvement on prognosis has been achieved. The resilience of GBM thus makes treating this tumour one of the biggest challenges currently faced by neuro-oncology. Aggressive and robust development, coupled with difficulties of complete resection, drug delivery and therapeutic resistance to treatment are some of the main issues that this nemesis presents today. Current treatments are far from satisfactory with poor prognosis, and focus on palliative management rather than curative intervention. However, therapeutic research leading to developments in novel treatment stratagems show promise in combating this disease. Here we present a review on GBM, looking at the history and advances which have shaped neurosurgery over the last century that cumulate to the present day management of GBM, while also exploring future perspectives in treatment options that could lead to new treatments on the road to a cure.

2998,"A case of a breast cancer patient with cardiac metastasis. [Japanese]. The patient was a 65-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Stage ffi A triple-negative breast cancer (T2N2aM0) at the age of 63. AC chemotherapy (3 months) followed by paditaxel plus bevacizumab (4 months) was administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, she underwent mastectomy and lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed a partial response. After surgery, radiotherapy with a radiation dose of 50 Gy was applied to the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph node. Multiple pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymph node metastases were diagnosed 23 months after initial treatment, and she was treated with S-1 administration. Two months after S-1 treatment, the PET-CT showed metastasis in the right atrium. Since there were no cardiac symptoms, S-1 treatment was continued without cardiovascular treatment. However, the mediastinal lymph node metastasis progressed; and therefore, S-1 administration was stopped and chemotherapy with eribulin was initiated. Brain metastasis was diagnosed at the same time and treated with a gamma knife. Although chemotherapy with eribulin was continued, the patient died 33 months after initial treatment owing to the brain metastasis. The cardiac metastasis did not progress during chemotherapy with eribulin. There was no sign of heart failure or arrhythmia during the treatment.

2366,"Trueperella bernardiae isolated from an unusual presentation of a necrotic uterine mass: A case report. Background An unusual presentation of endometrial cancer with infection by Trueperella bernardiae. Case A 70-year-old female with a significant history of weight loss and abdominal pain presented as an emergency with a peritonitic abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large uterine mass and pneumoperitoneum. Subsequent laparotomy found an enlarged uterus with necrosis and purulent exudate with no evidence of bowel perforation. This required a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Microscopy and culture of the peritoneal fluid produced a heavy growth of Clostridium ramosum and Trueperella bernardiae. Sensitivities included pip/tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Histology showed an extensively necrotic Stage 3A Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. This patient was septic on admission and suffered an acute kidney injury. Following recovery from surgery, treatment under the gynaecological oncology team will include chemotherapy, externalbeam radiation and brachytherapy. Conclusion This case is unusual as the initial clinical presentation suggested bowel perforation. This patient also suffered an unusual infection with Clostridium ramosum and Trueperella bernardiae, the latter is a very uncommon isolation. The CT scan showed a pneumoperitoneum which led to the suspicion of bowel perforation. At subsequent laparotomy, no evidence of bowel perforation was noted. The findings of pneumoperitoneum could be explained by culture findings of Clostridium ramosum resulting in a gas forming infection within the necrotic uterine mass. There are very few published case reports describing the clinical manifestations of Trueperella bernardiae, a facultative anaerobic gram-positive coccobacilli. Trueperella bernardiae can be a part of the regular skin flora however it has been the reported pathogen in cases of urinary tract infections, septic arthritis, diabetic foot infection, soft tissue infection, brain abscess and eye infections. We have found no previously reported cases of Trueperella bernardiae causing a uterine infection.",Excluded

An increase in 32P labelling of phosphatidylinositol, associated with synaptic activity, has previously been reported in excised sympathetic ganglia excited by preganglionic nerve impulses. In the present experiments a similar effect occurred in naturally-stimulated ganglia. It occurred when the preganglionic impulses were either evoked by electrical stimulation of the preganglionic nerve or were discharged spontaneously from the central nervous system. Thus increased turnover of phosphatidylinositol appears to be a normal accompaniment of synaptic transmission in these ganglia.",Excluded

The mean contents of trace elements in anterior gray horn section of cervical spinal cords of six amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases were relatively determined against those of six control cases by alpha-particle excited X-ray fluorescence analysis. The anterior gray horn section of cervical spinal cord samples were excited by 1.6 MeV alpha-particle beam of 2 mm diameter accelerated with a Van de Graaff accelerator, and characteristic X-ray spectra were measured with alpha Si(Li) detector. From the peak area on the X-ray spectra, the relative mean contents of the trace elements in cervical spinal cords of ALS and control cases were determined. As a result, the X-ray peaks of Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn were detected. The contents of Al, Si, P, Ca, Ti, V, Mn and Fe in ALS cases were higher than those in control cases. The contents of S, Cl, K, Cu and Zn in ALS and control cases were equal to each other within standard deviation.

Biological effects of man-made electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have been studied so far by experimental approaches exposing animals and cell cultures to EMFs. However, the evidence for cell toxicity induced by static magnetic field (SMF) is still uncertain. We investigated the effects produced by the exposure of human SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells to a uniform magnetic field at intensities of 2.2 mT, which is less than the recommended public exposure limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). A decrease of membrane mitochondrial potential up to 30% was measured after 24 h of exposure to SMF in SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was associated with reactive oxygen species production increase. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that exposure to a static magnetic intensity around 2.2 mT changed the secondary structure of cellular proteins and lipid components. The vibration bands relative to the methylene group increased significantly after 4 h of exposure, whereas further exposure up to 24 h produced evident shifts of amide I and II modes and a relative increase in beta-sheet contents with respect to alpha-helix components. Our study demonstrated that a moderate SMF causes alteration in cell homeostasis, as indicated by FTIR spectroscopy observations of changes in protein structures that are part of cell response to magnetic field exposure.",Excluded

Objective: We studied the effect of reirradiation to the vestibular apparatus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 52 reirradiated NPC patients underwent regular follow-up at Tzu Chi Hospital. Nine were diagnosed with vestibular apparatus disorders, based on detailed histories and balance function tests which included an illegible E-test, and refixation saccade test as well as bithermal air caloric and rotary chair tests. The clinical characteristics were analyzed. Result(s): Of 9 patients with vestibular apparatus disorders, seven had bilateral loss of vestibular function, one had vestibular neuronitis and one had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The 7 patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function had bilateral otitis media and moderate to profound bilateral hearing loss. Illegible E-test, refixation saccade test, electronystagmography, bithermal air caloric test and rotary chair test are useful tools for diagnosis. All 9 patients received total radiation dosages over 12,000 cGy. Conclusion(s): Bilateral loss of vestibular function is the most common vestibular apparatus disorder in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following reirradiation. Severe hearing loss and otitis media after high dosage radiation may predispose a patient to this disorder.",Excluded
1893,"Modulation of pain perception by transcranial magnetic stimulation of left prefrontal cortex. Evidence by functional imaging studies suggests the role of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the inhibitory control of nociceptive transmission system. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is able to modulate pain response to capsaicin. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of DLPFC activation (through rTMS) on nociceptive control in a model of capsaicin-induced pain. The study was performed on healthy subjects that underwent capsaicin application on right or left hand. Subjects judged the pain induced by capsaicin through a 0-100 VAS scale before and after 5 Hz rTMS over left and right DLPFC at 10 or 20 min after capsaicin application in two separate groups (8 subjects each). Left DLPFC-rTMS delivered either at 10 and 20 min after capsaicin application significantly decreased spontaneous pain in both hands. Right DLPFC rTMS showed no significant effect on pain measures. According to these results, stimulation of left DLPFC seems able to exert a bilateral control on pain system, supporting the critical antinociceptive role of such area. This could open new perspectives to non-invasive brain stimulation protocols of alternative target area for pain treatment.",Excluded
3616,"Radiation injury & mercury deposits in internal organs as a result of thallium-201 chloride intravenous injection for SPECT imaging; additional biochemical information obtained in the images of organs from SPECT or PET scans; & potential injury due to radiation exposure during long distance flights. In order to study functional as well as anatomical aspects of various internal organs, SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography) has been used extensively for evaluation of these organs. For SPECT study, intravenous injection of radioactive substances such as technetium-99m (20 millicuries) & thallium-201 chloride (3 millicuries) is commonly used. Although the physical half-life of thallium-201 chloride is 73 hours, its biological half-life is often more than 3.5 times that. Following intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride it is concentrated in the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland, testes or ovaries, and then eventually decays to mercury. Because of its relatively long physical & biological half-lives, thallium-201 chloride may produce mild radiation injury while it remains radioactive. Similar injuries may be induced by technetium-99m (often used for brain SPECT), which radiates Gamma rays (140 KeV), but since its physical half-life is only 6 hours, the side effects are not as significant as those of thallium-201 chloride. Since the main component of thallium-201 chloride radiation is X-ray (68-82 KeV), which consists of photons with a very short wavelength and a high penetrating power, prolonged exposure can induce electromagnetic field-induced injury. As a previous study of the principal author on electromagnetic field exposure indicated, electromagnetic field-induced injury causes the change of L-amino acids to D-amino acids. 2 days after SPECT study of the heart with intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride, the principal author experienced shortness of breath, loss of appetite, dizziness, fever, and general malaise within the week, and found a progressively significant increase in D-glutamic acid and decrease in L-glutamic acid peaking 2 weeks after the initial injection but lasting for many weeks after in organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland & testes, where radioactive substances had accumulated and radiation was at an average of about 400 counts/min. Even 2 months after the initial injection, the abnormal ratio of D-amino acids and L-amino acids had not returned to normal (in the radiation exposed heart, L-amino acids: 6 mg/dl with D-amino acids: 5 mg/dl; normal tissue, L-amino acids: 10 mg/dl with D-amino acids < 1 mg/dl).

3574,The effect of laser hemotherapy on the acid glycosaminoglycan content of the liver and blood plasma in rats in the dynamics of an alcoholic coma. [Russian]. The aim of the study was determination of the content of acid glycosaminoglicans (GAG) in hepatic tissue and blood plasma of rats in the course of alcoholic coma and in response to laser irradiation of venous blood. The alcoholic intoxication was achieved by introduction of 40% ethanol through a metal probe into the stomach. The content of acid GAG was defined according to Diche. Alcoholic coma caused reduction of GAG levels in hepatic tissue and an increase in blood plasma which were correlated with the severity of neurological state. Laser irradiation of venous blood promoted a trend to normalization of GAG content in the investigated tissues. A relative reduction in GAG plasma levels after laser hemotherapy indicates effectiveness of the conducted therapy.,Excluded
1852,"Zero echo time MRI-only treatment planning for radiation therapy of brain tumors after resection. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the sole imaging modality for patient modeling in radiation therapy (RT) is a challenging task due to the need to derive electron density information from MRI and construct a so-called pseudo-computed tomography (pCT) image. We have previously published a new method to derive pCT images from head T1-weighted (T1-w) MR images using a single-atlas propagation scheme followed by a post hoc correction of the mapped CT numbers using local intensity information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of our method with head zero echo time (ZTE) MR images. To evaluate results, the mean absolute error in bins of 20 HU was calculated with respect to the true planning CT scan of the patient. We demonstrated that applying our method using ZTE MR images instead of T1-w improved the correctness of the pCT in case of bone resection surgery prior to RT (that is, an example of large anatomical difference between the atlas and the patient).",Excluded

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the treatment results and prognostic factors in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer patients, retrospectively. METHODS Fifty-two patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer treated between 2005 and 2012, in our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS The 2-year overall survival and disease free survival rates were 48% and 15%. On univariate analysis T1 tumor (p=.012), concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p=.023), start of radiotherapy within the 3 months after diagnosis (p=.026) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (p=.025) significantly improved disease free survival rate. Concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p<.001), early radiotherapy (p<.001) and prophylactic cranial irradiaton (p=.001) significantly affected overall survival rate. On multivariate analysis, only prophylactic cranial irradiation was found to be an independent factor affecting overall survival rate (p=.003).

881,"An unusual natural history of metastatic basal cell carcinoma. Introduction: Basal Cell carcinoma (BCC), unlike other skin malignancies, rarely metastasizes with an incidence rate ranging between 0.0028 and 0.55%. Less than 400 cases have been reported in the literature over the past 120 years.We present a rare case of BCC that had recurrent metastasis in the lung over a period of 17 years. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is an 89 year old male with a history of BCC of the forehead resected 17 years ago. Eight years later, he presented with solitary pulmonary nodule confirmed to be metastatic BCC. He underwent wedge resection of the right lower lobe followed by radiation due to local recurrence. He now presented with numbness of the right hand worsened by deep inspiration. The patient denied fever, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain or shortness of breath. His other medical history included hypertension and COPD.Chest Xray showed right middle lobe infiltrate and elevated hemi diaphragm. CT scan of the chest without contrast demonstrated, right middle lobe pneumonia and a 2.5cm nodule in the left apex. He was treated with antibiotics and a subsequent CT chest with contrast confirmed only a spiculated mass in the left apex. CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and brain was unremarkable.PET-CT scan showed a hypermetabolic 2.3cm apical nodule with irregular border and SUV of 12.6, suspicious for a primary lung neoplasm. He had a CT guided biopsy and frozen section demonstrated malignant cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the lesion to be a metastatic BCC, morphologically similar to the primary BCC diagnosed 17 years. DISCUSSION: BCC is usually a slow growing, locally destructive lesion with excellent prognosis. On the other hand, metastatic BCC is very aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. The median time for metastasis from onset of initial lesion is about 9 years.The size of the initial tumor and local recurrence appear to predict the likelihood of metastatic disease.The metastasis can be either regional (RM) or distant (DM). Lung is a common site for distant metastasis .The median survival with DM is 24 months in comparison to 87 months with RM. This particular patient however survived for more than 8 years since his metastatic disease was first diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Metastatic BCC is a rare entity. Although historically associated with a poor prognosis, the natural history of metastatic BCC might not be as grim as reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the longest surviving patient with metastatic BCC ever reported. More research is necessary to better characterize favorable factors in metastatic BCC and find out the sub-group of patients who would greatly benefit from aggressive therapy.",Excluded

However, little progress has been made in extending overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life. Attempts to characterize and customize treatment of GBM have led to mitigating the deleterious effects of radiotherapy using hypofractionated radiotherapy, as well as various immunotherapies as a promising strategy for the incurable disease. A combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy may prove to be even more effective than either alone, and preclinical evidence suggests that hypofractionated radiotherapy can actually prime the immune system to make immunotherapy more effective.

1328,"STAT RAD: Prospective Dose Escalation Clinical Trial of Single Fraction Scan-Plan-QA-Treat Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Painful Osseous Metastases. PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is a well-established treatment for symptomatic bone metastases. Despite continued advances in both planning techniques and treatment delivery, the standard workflow has remained relatively unchanged, often requiring 1 to 3 weeks and resulting in patient inconvenience and delayed palliation. We developed an expedited method wherein computed tomography simulation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery are performed in 1 day. This prospective pilot clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and patient satisfaction of this rapid workflow.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with 1 to 3 painful bone metastases were prospectively enrolled and treated with 1 fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, using a same-day Scan-Plan-QA-Treat workflow, termed STAT RAD, in a phase 1/2 dose escalation trial from 8 Gy to 15 Gy per fraction. Bone pain, opioid use, patient satisfaction, performance status, and quality of life were evaluated before and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after treatment. Outcomes and treatment-related toxicity were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were enrolled, and 46 patients with 60 bone metastases were treated per the protocol. Partial or greater pain response occurred in 50% of patients at 1 week, 75% of patients at 8 weeks, 68.7% of patients at 6 months, and 33.3% of patients at 12 months. There were 2 grade-3 toxicities, including 1 spinal fracture associated with disease progression and hyperbilirubinemia. Reirradiation was required in 16.7% of treated lesions at a median time to retreatment of 4.9 months. Most patient responses (78.6%) indicated that patients would choose this workflow again.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that treating bone metastases with palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy via a single-fraction, patient-centric workflow is feasible and safe with doses up to 15 Gy. However, pain response decreased at 12 months and was associated with a 16.7% retreatment rate, which suggests that further dose escalation is warranted.",Excluded

With the development of manned spaceflight, the researches in space suggested that CVP did not increase, which is directly contradictory to the previous results under SW. This paper mainly discusses the changes of CVP and the effects of countermeasures on CVP under SW and microgravity, and the mechanisms of decreased CVP under microgravity. It is postulated that more suitable SW models, more studies about the area of low pressure including especially pulmonary circulation, and comprehensive studies in multiple systems are needed.",Excluded
1124,"Opposite effects of tetanic stimulation of the auditory thalamus or auditory cortex on the acoustic startle reflex in awake rats. The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle. The lateral amygdala nucleus (LA) receives auditory inputs from both the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus; MGN) and auditory association cortex (AAC), and is critical for auditory fear conditioning. The central amygdala nucleus, which has intra-amygdaloid connections with LA, enhances startle magnitude via midbrain connections to the startle circuits. Tetanic stimulation of either MGN or AAC in vitro or in vivo can induce long-term potentiation in LA. In the present study, behavioural consequences of tetanization of these auditory afferents were investigated in awake rats. The acoustic startle reflex of rats was enhanced by tetanic stimulation of MGN, but suppressed by that of AAC. All the tetanization-induced changes of startle diminished within 24 h. Blockade of GABAB receptors in the LA area reversed the suppressive effect of tetanic stimulation of AAC on startle but did not change the enhancing effect of tetanic stimulation of MGN. Moreover, transient electrical stimulation of MGN enhanced the acoustic startle reflex when it lagged behind acoustic stimulation, but inhibited the acoustic startle reflex when it preceded acoustic stimulation. The results of the present study indicate that MGN and AAC afferents to LA play different roles in emotional modulation of startle, and AAC afferents are more influenced by inhibitory GABAB transmission in LA.",Excluded
40,"The prospective self-controlled study of two different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion positions for treatment of thoracolumbar fracture in seven-year minimum follow-up. Purpose: To test the hypothesis that different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion position would increase the likelihood of facet joint injury and degeneration. Method(s): This prospective study included 35 patients with one-level neurological intact thoracolumbar fracture. From January 2006 to December 2007, patients were randomized underwent posterior reduction and percutaneous pedicle fixation using two different insertion techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiological and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of vertebral body height, kyphotic angle and facet joint degeneration. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Result(s): The operation was completed successfully in 35 patients. All patients were follow-up for an average of 89 months. There were no significant differences in percutaneous pedicle fixation time and radiation dose between two insertion techniques. In the transverse processpedicle group (TG), the length of the pedicle screw were significantly longer than control group (CG). Preoperative kyphotic angle and vertebral body height were significantly improved after surgery, and these has been well maintained at the last follow-up. There was significant differences in the occurrence of facet joint degeneration more than 1 grade between two groups (TG:3 vs. CG:23). All patients had significantly improvement on VAS and ODI scores after surgery, compared with their preoperative period. In the control group, 19 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion(s): The degeneration of facet joint is closely related to the position of the pedicle screw and rod during minimally invasive surgery. Compared with traditional puncture technique, the transverse process-pedicle puncture technique can reduce the facet joint degeneration caused by pedicle screw violation and rod stress, and provide enough space for transpedicular interbody bone grafting.",Excluded
96,"Circulating tumor cells with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition are associated with distant metastatic failures in lung cancer patients treated with definitive chemoradiation. Purpose/Objective(s): Preclinical studies suggest that radiation can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance matrix invasion in several tumor types. To assess if this occurs clinically, we analyzed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for EMT markers (EMT-CTC) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiation. Materials/Methods: This prospective study enrolled 22 patients between April 2011 and May 2012. The primary endpoint was distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. None had induction chemotherapy. One patient had hypofractionated protons without chemotherapy. Serial blood samples (20 mL) were drawn at baseline (pretreatment), twice during treatment, and once at first follow-up. One tube of blood (10 mL) was sent to enumerate cytokeratin (CK)-positive/CD45-negative cells (HD-CTCs) using an automated microscopic image analysis system. A second tube was analyzed using the StemDx assay, a quantitative PCR-based assay to detect transcripts of EMT markers (SNAIL, TWIST, TG2, and CMET) on CTC in peripheral blood samples depleted of CD326/EpCAM+ CTC and CD45+ leukocytes by antibody coated magnetic beads. DMFS time was counted from date of first blood draw to the DM or death or last contact. Deaths without DM on the date of last contact were counted as events. Due to the small sample size, all times to event were subjected to univariable analysis using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the comparisons of distributions between groups were made using the log-rank test. Result(s): Patients had either stage 3A/B (n = 16), oligometastatic stage 4 (bone or brain) (n=2), or localized recurrent or positive margin disease after surgery that was amendable for definitive treatment (n = 4). The median follow-up for all patients from the time of first blood draw to the last contact date or death was 9.5 months, and for living patients was 11.1 months. At last follow-up, 8 had died, 8 progressed with DM, and 2 had in-field local relapse. Using the Epic Sciences assay,DMFSwas significantly associated with>=10 HD-CTCs/mL of blood (p = 0.036). The presence of CMET or SNAIL transcripts on CTC by StemDx also significantly predicted for both DMFS (p= 0.036) and recurrence of any type (p =0.02). Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we found an association between DMFS and either >= 10 HD-CTC/mL of blood or EMT markers CMET or SNAIL in NSCLC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation. While these data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients, EMT-CTCs may reflect metastatic burden as seen in some of the patients with elevated HD-CTC counts, and may be valuable biomarkers to risk stratify patients after definitive chemoradiation.",Excluded

2027,"Characterization of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) brain-type fatty acid binding protein (fabp7) genes reveals the fates of teleost fabp7 genes following whole genome duplications. Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes. The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals, one (3R) at the base of the teleost radiation and another (4R) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids. We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein (fabp) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs. As previously described for zebrafish, we identified two copies (fabp7a and fabp7b) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt, but there was only a single transcript in northern pike, the closest relative of the salmonids, and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and grayling. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt, and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids. This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes. There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions. Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike. However, only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII, like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish, was expressed in the liver. A comparison of ~ 2000 bp upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62 bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII. The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2658,"Radiation therapy for melanoma: Adjuvant, palliative and abscopal effects. Radiation therapy (RT) has long played a role in the management of melanoma, however historically its efficacy has been questioned due to the perceived radioresistance of melanoma cells in vitro. Apart from proton therapy for choroidal melanoma, RT has limited accepted indications as a definitive treatment. Surgery remains the first line therapy of choice for operable patients and adjuvant RT can be considered for high-risk primary tumours. Prospective randomised data are awaited following a Phase II TROG study reporting high local control rates (93%) following postoperative nodal irradiation in selected patients with node-positive melanoma. High response rates of melanoma (e.g. mucosal or inoperable) to primary radiotherapy have also been reported. Local radiation can achieve tumour-antigen release and clinical results suggest biological interaction with immunomodulating agents (a checkpoint inhibitor and anti-CTLA4 antibody), corroborated by preclinical data. Much interest also lies in enhancing melanoma radiation response rates through combination with clinical hyperthermia, which can achieve radiosensitisation, at least in part, by immune modulation. Novel developments in radiotherapy include the rise in radiosurgical treatment (SRS), involving high dose, small volume irradiation. SRS is increasingly the palliation of choice for patients with two or more brain metastases, following resection of a single brain metastasis and for extra-cranial oligometastases. The results of a Phase III trial evaluating whole brain radiotherapy are awaited. The radiobiological consequences of SRS may be even more immunomodulatory, congruent with retrospective data that fraction sizes greater than 4 Gray are more effective and SRS alone has been suggested to induce an abscopal effect. To date there are limited data reporting SRS with concomitant immunomodulators and the optimal combinations remain to be defined. Serious toxicities have been reported following administration of B-RAF inhibitors with and subsequent to both SRS and fractionated RT. Combination strategies are being actively researched as these should increase the effectiveness of radiation in the management of patients with melanoma by widening the therapeutic window between normal tissue toxicity and melanoma cell kill, and by potentially inducing an out-offield abscopal effect.",Excluded
1603,"Clinical acceptability of SRS treatment of two simultaneous targets with varying magnitudes of rotation error. Purpose/Objective(s): We investigated the target rotational errors (i.e., pitch, roll, yaw) and evaluated the dosimetric impact of simultaneous treatment ofmultiple brain lesionswith amono-isocentric technique of using image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery. The Elekta Synergy S with dissociated simultaneous multiple port (dose islands) within a single field. This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique.",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the impact of repeat head computed tomography (CT) during (1) interfacility transfer and (2) inpatient and/or outpatient follow-up on management, cost-effectiveness, and radiation dose in neurologically stable patients with mild traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). Material(s) and Method(s): This is a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with mild tSAH presenting between January 2017 and July 2019. A total of 101 and 140 patients met the eligibility criteria for the first and second subgroups, respectively. Common inclusion criteria were isolated mild tSAH, Glasgow Coma Scale between 13 and 15, and neurological stability. Additional inclusion criteria for the first subgroup were availability of brain imaging at the outside institution prior to transfer and the second subgroup was the availability of follow-up imaging. Result(s): In the first subgroup, 76.20% of patients had stable SAH, 18.80% had reduced SAH, while 5% had an interval increase in SAH. None required any surgical intervention. Additional per-patient mean radiation exposure was 1.77 +/- 0.26 mSv. In the second subgroup, all 140 patients had complete resolution of tSAH. One patient had a new tiny subdural hemorrhage, which subsequently resolved on follow-up. The additional mean radiation exposure was 2.47 +/- 1.29 mSv. A total of 256 avoidable CT scans were performed resulting in excess health care costs of about US$531 696. Conclusion(s): In neurologically stable isolated tSAH patients, repeat brain imaging during interfacility transfer and inpatient and/or outpatient follow-up do not alter patient management despite increased health care costs and radiation burden.

339,"[Effects of parabolic flight on redox status in SH-SY5Y cells]. Space flight is known to produce a number of neurological disturbances. The etiology is unknown, but it may involve increased oxidative stress. A line of experimental evidence indicates that space flight may disrupt antioxidant defense system and result in increased oxidative stress. In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells. These results obtained suggest that altered gravity may increase protein nitration, down-regulate TRXR and elicit oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells, while TRX transfection could partly protect cells against oxidative stress induced by parabolic flight.",Excluded
1812,"The interaction of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and ionizing radiation in a rat glioma model. The effects of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and cobalt 60 (60Co) irradiation were studied in a rat glioma model using an in vivo and an in vitro clonogenic assay. There was no effect on tumor growth by visible light or by a single dose of 60Co irradiation at 4 Gy or 8 Gy, whereas 16 Gy inhibited tumor growth to 40% versus the control. Hematoporphyrin derivative alone slightly stimulated growth (P less than 0.1). Light in the presence of 10 mg hematoporphyrin derivative/kg inhibited tumor growth to 32%. 60Co irradiation in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a significant tumor growth inhibition (P less than 0.02). This growth inhibition was directly related to the concentration of hematoporphyrin derivative. The addition of 60Co to light in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a greater growth inhibition than light or 60Co irradiation alone. This effect was most pronounced when light was applied 30 minutes before 60Co irradiation. Our experiments in a subcutaneous rat glioma model suggest a radiosensitizing effect of hematoporphyrin derivative. Furthermore, the photodynamic inactivation is enhanced by the addition of 60Co irradiation. These findings may be of importance in planning new treatment modalities in malignant brain tumors.",Excluded
3621,"Alterations in uptake and release rates for GABA, glutamate, and glutamine during biochemical maturation of highly purified cultures of cerebral cortical neurons, a GABAergic preparation. This study demonstrates that virtually homogenous cultures of mouse cerebral neurons, obtained from 15-day-old embryos, differentiate at least as well as cultures which in addition contain astrocytes. This was indicated by glutamate decarboxylase activity which within 2 weeks rose from a negligible value to twice the level in the adult mouse cerebral cortex, and by a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake rate which quadrupled during the second week in culture and reached higher values than in brain slices. Within the same period, the GABA content increased four to five times to 75 nmol/mg protein, and a potassium-induced increase in [<sup>14</sup>C]GABA efflux became apparent. Although the development was faster than in vivo, optimum differentiation required maintenance of the cultures beyong the age of 1 week. Uptake and release rates for glutamate and glutamine underwent much less developmental alteration. At no time was there any potassium-induced release of radioactivity after exposure to [<sup>14</sup>C]glutamate, and the glutamate uptake was only slightly increased during the period of GABAergic development. This indicates that exogenous glutamate is not an important GABA precursor. Similarly, glutamine uptake was unaltered between days 7 and 14, although a small potassium-induced release of radioactivity after loading with glutamine suggests a partial conversion to GABA.",Excluded
737,"The radiation exposure of the patient from stable-xenon computed tomography. For stable-xenon computed tomography (CT), an X-ray examination for measurement of cerebral blood circulation in the brain, the radiation exposure of the patient was determined in order to estimate the risk of inducing cancer. Organ doses of brain, eyelenses, thyroid and gonads have been calculated using the measured air kerma free-in-air on the axis of rotation and organ-specific conversion factors calculated with the Monte Carlo method. Dose measurements with TLD-100 rods using a humanoid Alderson phantom were carried out for verification of the calculated organ doses. In the case of brain partially located in the region of primary radiation a mean organ dose of 39 mSv was calculated. The dose measurements showed dose equivalents between 6 and 68 mSv in different regions of the brain and consequently an inhomogeneous dose distribution. From an estimation of the radiation-induced risk using the effective dose of 1.6 mSv it follows that one additional fatal cancer per 12,500 stable-xenon CT examinations has to be expected. The organ doses of eyelenses and thyroid located in the region of scattered radiation are so low that biological effects are hardly to be expected. The calculated dose equivalents of 6.5 mSv and 0.5 mSv, respectively, are in good agreement with measurements. The organ dose of gonads amounted to less than 0.07 mSv.",Excluded

The FDG avid sites were tabulated as the primary site, lower extremity, brain, and other sites. The hypothesis is that routine skull base to mid-thigh versus whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in patients with malignant melanoma will not change management.Results: Patients (26) were divided into those with primary melanoma site in either the lower extremities (six patients) or other site (20 patients). Four of the six patients with the primary site in the lower extremities also had positive findings in the ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes. One of the patients with a positive inguinal lymph node had metastatic sites in the external iliac region and lungs on the initial study. On follow-up imaging, this patient also exhibited diffuse metastatic disease, including a lower extremity. None of the remaining patients in this group had positive findings other than the primary site in the lower extremity. Of the remaining 20 patients with the primary site not in the lower extremity, one had diffuse metastatic disease that included a lower extremity. However, lower extremity involvement would not change patient management in this case. A second patient in this group had diffuse metastatic disease that also involved the brain. However, no metastatic disease was present in the lower extremities in this patient. None of the remaining 18 patients in this group had metastatic disease in a lower extremity. Two patients in the entire study group of 26 had brain metastasis on contrast-enhanced head CT, with one having multiple brain metastasis. PET failed to demonstrate some of the brain lesions.

1065,"Hemodynamic effects of midodrine after spaceflight in astronauts without orthostatic hypotension. INTRODUCTION: Orthostatic hypotension and presyncope are common and potentially serious risks for astronauts returning from space. Susceptible subjects fail to generate an adequate adrenergic response to upright posture. The alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, midodrine, may be an effective countermeasure. We tested the hypothesis that midodrine would have no negative hemodynamic effect on healthy astronauts returning from space.METHODS: Five male astronauts participated in preflight and post-flight tilt testing on a control flight as well as on the test flights, where midodrine (10 mg, orally) was administered after landing approximately 1 h before testing.RESULTS: None of these astronauts exhibited orthostatic hypotension or presyncope before or after either flight. Midodrine did not cause any untoward reactions in these subjects before or after flight; in fact, a modest beneficial effect was seen on postflight tachycardia (p = 0.036).DISCUSSION: These data show that midodrine protected against post-spaceflight increases in heart rate without having any adverse hemodynamic effects on non-presyncopal, male astronauts.

PURPOSE: To review outcomes for patients with skull base meningiomas treated using the stereotactic proton beam at the National Accelerator Center (NAC), Republic of South Africa.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions.RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits.

We have also shown that besides these functions, the latter subdivision is involved in the regulations of hormone secretions such as insulin, glucagon, corticosterone and vasopressin. It has been also shown by electrophysiological means that light exposure to rat eye enhances sympathetic nerve activity, whereas it depresses parasympathetic nerve activity. Thus, environmental light is implicated not only in the phase-shift through the retinohypthalamic tract (RHT), but also control of autonomic nerve activities through the RHT, It is also discussed in this review how the two divisions are interconnected and how environmental light is involved in this interconnection.

1743,"Trends in radiotherapeutic management and outcomes in esophageal brain metastases. Objective: To examine national practice patterns and survival outcomes in patients with brain metastases from an esophageal primary treated with intracranial radiation. Background(s): Brain metastasis from an esophageal primary are a rare occurrence, therefore clinical data regarding management and outcomes are limited. Intracranial radiotherapy in the form of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common treatment approaches in management of brain metastases, however the utilization patterns and efficacy of each technique in esophageal based brain metastasis are unknown. Design/Methods: We analyzed 289 stage IV esophageal cancer patients with documented brain metastasis treated with intracranial radiotherapy as reported by the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) between the years 2004-2014. The treatment arms included those receiving WBRT versus SRS. Univariable and multivariable analyses identified characteristics predictive of overall survival. Multivariable logistic regression identified co-variates associated with each treatment arm. Result(s): There were 230 patients in the WBRT group and 59 patients in the SRS group. With multivariable analysis, SRS receipt was an independent predictor of improved overall survival (HR=0.63, p=0.005) along with receipt of chemotherapy, lower comorbidity score, African American race, and absence of liver/bone metastases (p<0.01). Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years for the WBRT was 17% and 4% (median OS: 4.5 months) compared to 32% and 12% (median OS: 6.9 months) for the SRS arm (p=0.004). Notably, patient age, tumor grade, histology, presence of lung metastasis, and sex were not associated with differences in OS. More recent treatment year was associated with receipt of SRS (p=0.03).

3355,"Low level laser therapy alters satellite glial cell expression and reverses nociceptive behavior in rats with neuropathic pain. BACKGROUND: Nerve injury often results in persistent or chronic neuropathic pain characterized by spontaneous burning pain accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a noninvasive method that has proved to be clinically effective in reducing pain sensitivity and consequently in improving the quality of life. Here we examined the effects of LLLT on pain sensitivity induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. CCI was performed on adult male rats, subjected thereafter to 10 sessions of LLLT, every other day, and starting 14 days after CCI. Over the treatment period, the animals were evaluated for nociception using behavioral tests, such as allodynia, thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. Following the sessions, we observed the involvement of satellite glial cells in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence approaches. In addition we analyzed the expression levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1beta) and fractalkine (FKN) after the same stimulus.RESULTS: LLLT induced an early reduction (starting at the second session; p <= 0.001) of the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia in CCI rats, which persisted until the last session. Regarding cellular changes, we observed a decrease of GFAP (50%; p <= 0.001) expression after LLLT in the ipsilateral DRG when compared with the naive group. We also observed a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines after CCI, whereas LLLT dramatically inhibited the overexpression of these proteins.CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that LLLT reverses CCI-induced behavioral hypersensitivity, reduces glial cell activation in the DRG and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines; we suggest that this involvement of glial cells can be one potential mechanism in such an effect.",Excluded
3037,"Paired associative stimulation. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) refers to a paradigm consisting of slow-rate repetitive low-frequency median nerve stimulation combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex. This protocol has been shown to induce plastic changes of excitability in the human motor cortex. Its principles of design were shaped after associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in experimental animals, a cellular mechanism likely to be relevant for learning and memory. PAS-induced changes of cortical excitability share a number of physiological properties with LTP. Of particular importance is the fact that the sign of PAS-induced changes of the size of amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) depends on the exact interval between the afferent and the magnetic pulse during the intervention. A number of observations suggest that PAS-induced excitability changes may have functional significance. PAS-induced plasticity may contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of neurological disorders where neuroplasticity is thought to have a pathogenetic role. Finally, PAS-induced plasticity may itself have therapeutic potential. [References: 16]",Excluded

3107,"Tracking target position variability using intraprostatic fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging in prostate cancer radiotherapy. Modern radiotherapy has achieved substantial improvement in tumour control and toxicity rates by escalating the total dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding normal tissues. It has therefore become necessary to precisely track tumour position in order to minimise geometrical uncertainties due to setup errors and organ motion. We conducted this prospective evaluation of prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided conformal radiation therapy at our institution. We implanted three fiducial markers (gold seeds) within the prostatic gland in order to quantify daily target displacements and to generate specific margins around the clinical target volume (CTV) to create an appropriate planned target volume (PTV). Between April and December 2009, ten patients affected with localised prostate cancer were transrectally implanted with three radio-opaque markers. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for planning purposes following proper bladder and rectum preparation. During treatment two orthogonal images were acquired daily and compared with previously generated digitally reconstructed radiographs. After manual localisation, comparison between the position of the gold seeds on the portal and reference images was carried out, and a set of extrapolated lateral-lateral (LL), anterior-posterior (AP) and cranial-caudal (CC) shift corrections was calculated and recorded. Couch corrections were applied with a threshold of 3 mm displacement. Systematic and random errors for each direction were calculated either as measured according to displacement of the gold seeds prior to any couch movement and after couch position correction according to the radio-opaque markers. For skin marks, mean systematic and random errors were 0.12+2.94 mm for LL, 1.04+3.37 mm for AP, -1.14+2.71 mm for CC, whereas for seed markers, mean and systematic errors were 0.6+1.5 mm for LL, 0.51+2.45 mm for AP and -0.25+2.51 mm for CC. A scatter plot generated on all measurements after couch repositioning according to gold-seed displacement suggested a confidence range of shift distributions within 5 mm for LL, 8 mm for CC, and 7 mm for AP. The total systematic and random components were then used to calculate proper PTV in patients receiving conventional treatment (7 mm for LL and 9 mm for both AP and CC). Prostate positional variability during a course of radiation treatment is strongly influenced by setup and organ motion. Organ tracking through fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging is able to reduce the spread of displacements, significantly contributing to improve the ballistic precision of radiation delivery.",Excluded
1939,"Changes in intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in adult rat S1 during cortical reorganization. Peripheral denervation causes significant changes in the organization of developing or adult primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, the basic mechanisms that underlie reorganization are not well understood. Most attention has been focused on possible synaptic mechanisms associated with reorganization. However, another important determinant of cortical circuit function is the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in the circuit. Here we document changes in the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in cortical layer 2/3 in adult rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) after varying durations of forepaw denervation. Denervation of the forepaw induced a rapid and sustained shift in the location of the border between the forepaw and lower jaw representations of adult S1 (reorganization). Coronal slices from the reorganized region were maintained in vitro and the intrinsic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of S1 were determined using whole cell recordings. In general, passive membrane properties were not affected by denervation; however, a variety of active properties were. The most robust changes were increases in the amplitudes of the fast and medium afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and an increase in the interval between action potentials (APs). Additional changes at some durations of denervation were observed for the AP threshold. These observations indicate that changes in intrinsic properties, mostly reflecting a decrease in overall excitation, may play a role in changes in cortical circuit properties during reorganization in adult S1, and suggest a possible role for AHPs in some of those changes.",Excluded

2840,"Noninvasive fluorescence imaging in animal models of stroke. Noninvasive fluorescence imaging (NFI) is a powerful tool to study physiology and pathophysiology in animal disease models. NFI has been successfully applied in a number of animal disease models including cancer, arthritis, and stroke. Furthermore, several applications in humans have been described. NFI is widely available in research laboratories because it has a number of advantages: It uses non-ionizing radiation and requires comparably simple, inexpensive instrumentation, and easy to handle. Fluorochromes can be detected with high sensitivity, and image acquisition time is relatively short. Furthermore, a plethora of fluorescent imaging agents is available including unspecific, target-specific, and activatable imaging probes. With these probes, biological processes such as inflammation, cell death or enzyme activity, and many others can be visualized in living animals. This review offers an overview of current approaches in NFI of stroke pathophysiology in animal models of cerebral ischemia. First, the instrumentation and the different types of imaging agents for NFI are described. Second, a short introduction to animal models of stroke is provided. Third, examples for NFI in animal models of stroke are given. Finally, the use of NFI in human stroke is critically discussed.",Excluded

862,"Combination of surgery and stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) with 3D-SPECT/CT treatment planning for primary and metastatic liver tumors. Purpose/Objective(s): Evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of SRT in combination with hepatic resection of primary and metastatic liver tumors. Materials/Methods: Sixteen patients completed hepatectomy and SRT for either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (6) or metastases from colorectal (5), neuroendocrine (2), uterine (2), or sarcoma (1) primary. Twenty-one operable metastases were resected in 5 patients and gold fiducials were placed into the unresectable lesions to facilitate definitive SRT. Three patients with initially unresectable tumors received preoperative SRT followed by R0 resection. SRT as a bridge to liver transplant was used in 4 patients with HCC. Four patients had salvage SRT for recurrence after surgery. All patients completed 4D-CT and 3DSPECT/ CT to define functional normal liver volume (NLV) for SRT planning. MV-fluoro was performed to confirm tumor/fiducial respiratory motion within the PTV. In retrospect, our patient's treatment planning, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were reviewed under an IRB approved outcomes study. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE v3.0. Result(s): All patients successfully completed a combination of hepatectomy and SRT. Forty lesions were treated with hepatectomy and 20 (<= 3 per patient) received SRT with a mean PTV of 132.6 cc (range, - 9.7- 803.5). The mean dose was 47.7 Gy (range, - 36-60) prescribed to the PTV in 5-16 fractions. With median follow-up of 17.7 months (range, - 5.8-32.1), 2 patients had grade 3 elevation of Total Bilirubin prior to initiation of SRT which persisted through treatment. No incidence of > grade 1 radiation-induced liver disease was observed. The most common clinical toxicity was Grade <= 2 fatigue. No patients had grade > 2 clinical toxicity. As a group, functional NLVs defined on 3D-SPECT/CT were significantly reduced compared to liver volumes defined on CT and estimated from the Body Surface Area equation (p = 0.037 and p = 0.0012 respectively). Postoperative morbidity was <= Grade 1. On followup imaging, no in-field failures have occurred. A total of 18.7% of the patients have had a failure elsewhere in the liver. Overall survival was 75% with 4 deaths, 2 of which were from liver failure and 2 from progressive systemic disease. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary study indicates that combination of liver SRT with hepatic resection is safe and effective. It can be used preoperatively to increase resectability or postoperatively to salvage surgical failures. It can also be used to target unresectable metastases in combination with limited hepatectomies for resectable peripheral lesions thereby expanding indications for curative treatment. SRT planning with 3D-SPECT/CT allows identification and preservation of the functional NLV.",Excluded
1599,"Novel snapshot imaging of photoreceptor bleaching in macaque and human retinas. PURPOSE: Various methods have been used to obtain a topographic map of bleached photopigments in human retinas in the past. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the bleaching topography of the photoreceptors could be obtained by snapshot imaging reflectometry.METHODS: Four to five fundus photographs of one rhesus monkey and three healthy human subjects were taken by white flashes at intervals of 4 s, with a commercial fundus camera with minimal modifications. The flash-induced reflectance increases (bleaching) were calculated by dividing the reflectance of the first image into the subsequent images, pixel by pixel.RESULTS: The topography of the bleached macula corresponded well with the anatomical distribution of the cones. The ratio of reflectance changes in the center to that in the surrounding tissue was high for red and low for green and blue images. These results indicate that the reflectivity changes were not artifacts but were derived from changes in the photopigment density in the cones and rods.CONCLUSIONS: The topography of bleached photoreceptors obtained with a commercial fundus camera from one monkey and three healthy human subjects showed that this technique has potential as a new clinical method for examining photoreceptor function in both normal and diseased retinas.",Excluded
3038,"Time dependent ultrastructural alterations on the skin, eye, barbel and fins of the spawn of Clarias batrachus (Linn. 1758) exposed to UV-B radiation. Present study highlighted the ultramicroscopic (SEM) alterations of the skin, eye, barbel, and fins of spawn of an air-breathing teleost (Clarias batrachus, Linn. 1758) induced by UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) at a dose (@4.07 x 10<sup>-20</sup>J/photon/m<sup>2</sup>) under the time-frame of 5, 10 and 15 min/d in the laboratory condition for the periods of 5 and 10 days. Limnological parameters revealed no significant changes throughout the period of experimentation which were measured by PCS Testr 35 Multi-Parameter. Morphometric analysis revealed that during the extended exposure period of 10 days the spawn size and weight were reduced as analysed through Specific Growth Rate (SGR). SGR values in terms of weight for 5 and 10 days under 3 time-frames were 17.12%, 12.52%, 11.46% and 9.09%, 6.43%, 6.09% respectively, which revealed a declined trend along with the exposure days. In the skin of C. batrachus, the compact regular orientation of the stratified epithelial cells and mucous cells became distorted and the microridges and double-ridged structures showed destruction and fragmentations. The body striations and microfolds became shrinked and swollen and finally degenerated to form a mass. The distribution of mucous cells throughout the epidermis was disorganised and releasing secretory contents on the surface through small pores. Appearance of huge quantity of biogenic semi-hexagonal plate like crystals (guanine platelets) on the skin surface of the body was the most significant observations during UV-B radiation. In the developmental phases the eyeball showed shrinkage loosing normal regular concave structure and to become a dome-shaped one. The supportive connective infoldings became loosened. The choroid coat displayed deformities and the iris deformed the pupil. The fibroblast on the epithelium and melanocytes depicted dispersed arrangement. The pairs of ventral barbels near the mouth depicted the presence of taste buds that became severely damaged exposing the sensory as well as neuroepithelial cells. Compact regular arrangement of the SECs was completely destroyed leaving long and deep channels inbetween them; the disintegrated concentric MRs also showed a mass.",Excluded
1613,"Empirical vs risk-based approach to intracavernosal injection therapy: A prospective study. Objectives: Intracavernosal injection (ICI) therapy is widely used for ED. Employing it in practice is largely empirical and has not been validated with evidence-based approaches. This study compares two strategies for ICI to determine whether a risk-based approach is more efficacious, increases satisfaction and/or results in fewer treatment complications. Method(s): After obtaining IRB approval, a prospective database of patients enrolled in the ICI program at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from May 2012-present was amassed. Demographic information, treatment outcomes and subjective patient evaluations of sexual function (IIEF, QEQ, SQoL and EDITS questionnaires) were obtained at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Two approaches were compared. Group 1 consisted of empiric ICI treatment. Patients were treated with Prostaglandin E1 10 mcg, irrespective of ED etiology or severity, and only if poor response noted at test injection, then initiated on bimix or trimix. Group 2 was a risk-based approach, where using an algorithm that factored in: organic vs. neurogenic ED, number of ED risk factors, prostatectomy, nerve-sparing status, time from surgery and radiation status, patients were treated with either bimix, low- or high-dose trimix. Dose titration was permitted in both groups. Statistical analysis was carried out using t-test and chi-squared analysis. Result(s): 175 patients were enrolled (57 in Group 1, 118 in Group 2) with 3 and 6 month f/u at 57% and 35% respectively, and similar between groups. Baseline patient characteristics and sexual function questionnaire responses were similar between groups 1 and 2, (mean age 61.9 vs. 61.3 p = 0.66, IIEF-EF 8.1 vs. 6.9 p = 0.28, and SQoL 37.7 vs. 39.2 p = 0.71), though Group 1 reported higher quality erections at baseline (QEQ 14.3 vs. 7.3 p = 0.05) and had a lower proportion of post-prostatectomy patients 54.4% vs. 74.6% (p = 0.02). In both groups, quality of erections (QEQ) improved with treatment (mean 10.78 vs. 56.76, p < 0.05), SQoL improved (38.41 vs. 50.25, p < 0.05), and IIEF-EF improved (7.51 vs. 18.48, p < 0.05). However, between groups at 3 and 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in responses for IIEF, QEQ, SQoL or EDITS, and no difference in failure or medication switch rates. There were no significant differences in complication rates, though at 3 months group 2 reported a higher incidence of priapism and pain (23% vs. 7.4% p = 0.08).

841,"MMP-2 siRNA inhibits radiation-enhanced invasiveness in glioma cells. BACKGROUND: Our previous work and that of others strongly suggests a relationship between the infiltrative phenotype of gliomas and the expression of MMP-2. Radiation therapy, which represents one of the mainstays of glioma treatment, is known to increase cell invasion by inducing MMP-2. Thus, inhibition of MMP-2 provides a potential means for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy for malignant glioma.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have tested the ability of a plasmid vector-mediated MMP-2 siRNA (p-MMP-2) to modulate ionizing radiation-induced invasive phenotype in the human glioma cell lines U251 and U87. Cells that were transfected with p-MMP-2 with and without radiation showed a marked reduction of MMP-2 compared to controls and pSV-transfected cells. A significant reduction of proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of cells transfected with p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation was observed compared to controls. Western blot analysis revealed that radiation-enhanced levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, pVEGFR-2, p-FAK, and p-p38 were inhibited with p-MMP-2-transfected cells. TUNEL staining showed that radiation did not induce apoptosis in U87 and U251 cells while a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells was observed when irradiated cells were simultaneously transfected with p-MMP-2 as compared to controls. Intracranial tumor growth was predominantly inhibited in the animals treated with p-MMP-2 alone or in combination with radiation compared to controls.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: MMP-2 inhibition, mediated by p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation, significantly reduced tumor cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating several important downstream signaling molecules and directing cells towards apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate the efficacy of p-MMP-2 in inhibiting radiation-enhanced tumor invasion and progression and suggest that it may act as a potent adjuvant for radiotherapy in glioma patients.",Excluded
954,"Phase i trial of genetically modified hematopoetic progenitor cells facilitating bone marrow chemoprotection and enabling TMZ/o6bg dose escalation resulting in improved survival. INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor with a median survival of 15 months despite surgery and aggressive radio-chemotherapy. The most important mechanism of TMZ resistance is the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene which repairs temozolamide-induced DNA methylation. The MGMT inhibitor O6-benzylguanine (BG) has demonstrated efficacy in depleting MGMT and maximizing tumor response in early phase clinical trials. However, because MGMT expression is also low in hematopoietic cells, this has resulted in unacceptable bone marrow toxicity, and this approach has been abandoned. We hypothesized that chemoprotection of hematopoieticprogenitor cells (HPC) with an MGMT mutant (MGMT-P140K) characterized by normal methyltransferase activity coupled with low affinity for BG, would maximize anti-tumor response while enabling patients to tolerate TMZ & BG dose escalation with minimal toxicity. We thus performed a phase I trial to test this hypothesis. METHOD(S): We treated 7 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed GBM with standard surgery and radiation, followed by transplantation with autologous CD34+hematopoetic progenitor cells engineered to express MGMT-P140K using a lentiviral vector in three arms. To assess chemo-protection, patients' blood counts and transgene marking were monitored during the treatment as was tumor growth and survival. RESULT(S): The viral transduction rates were 2.5-75% and were clearly improved in the third arm with intra-patient dose escalation. P140K-MGMT gene markings in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells increased 3-26- fold with only mild-moderate (Grade 2-3) mylosuppression consistent with chemo-selection and chemo-protection as hypothesized. Survival ranged from 20-36 months which exceeded their RPA predicted survival by 1.9- 3.2 fold suggesting clinical benefit (mean 2.0). Viral insertion site analysis failed to demonstrate evidence of clonal dominance. CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary result demonstrates that this chemoprotection strategy is tolerable, safe, and facilitates TMZ & BG dose escalation resulting in increased survival in a small cohort of selected patients. A phase II study is planned.",Excluded

2795,"Choroideremia: melanopsin-mediated postillumination pupil relaxation is abnormally slow. PURPOSE: To investigate the rod-cone and melanopsin pupillary light response (PLR) pathways in choroideremia.METHODS: Eight patients with choroideremia and 18 healthy age-matched controls underwent chromatic pupillometry by applying blue (463 nm) and red light (643 nm) at 100 lux intensity to the right eye while recording pupil diameters. Absolute baseline pupil size (mm), normalized maximal pupil constriction and the early and late postillumination pupillary dilation, from 0 to 10 seconds and 10 to 30 seconds after the end of illumination, respectively, were determined. Postillumination responses to blue light were considered to be primarily driven by melanopsin activation of the intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.RESULTS: Baseline pupil diameters were comparable in patients with choroideremia and control subjects (p = 0.48). The maximum pupil constriction in patients with choroideremia was severely weakened in red light but only mildly weakened in blue light (p < 0.05). Postillumination dilation of the pupil was normal after red illumination but extremely protracted after blue illumination. Also, in contrast to healthy subjects, no abrupt change in the dilation curve was seen in the patients after the end of blue illumination, the early-phase dilation being completely abolished (p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Rod-cone-driven pupil responses were decreased as expected in an outer retinal degeneration, and near-normal pupil constriction in blue light supports that the melanopsin system is normal. In contrast, the lack of brisk early-phase dilation after blue illumination in choroideremia is remarkable and may be interpreted to mean that the absence of photoreceptor inhibition promotes a tonic contraction of the pupil.",Excluded

Result(s): 60 pts presented with low grade GG and 7 with anaplastic GG. The median age at diagnosis was 27 years (18-59). 22 pts developed recurrent disease (18 low grade and 4 high grade) with a median time to recurrence of 87 weeks from surgery. 7 of the pts with low grade GG had malignant transformation to a malignant tumor (anaplastic GG or GBM). 22 pts received radiation therapy, 16 at diagnosis. 14 pts received chemotherapy at recurrence. Pts with incomplete resections or higher grade tumors were more likely to receive chemotherapy or radiation. The median overall survival (OS) time for these pts was not reached with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years. The 2-, 5- and 10-year OS were 98%, 87%, and 76%. Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with OS were KPS at presentation (HR 10.1; 95% CI 2.6, 39.1; p = 0.0008), extent of resection (EOR) (biopsy vs gross total; HR 12.1; 95% CI 2.3, 63.6; p = 0.003), histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs Grade 3-4; HR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01, 0.3; p = 0.0002), and seizure control following surgery (Engel I vs Engel 2-3; HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.01, 0.9; p = 0.02). Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS) were EOR (biopsy vs gross total; HR 4.0; 95% CI 1.4, 11.9; p = 0.01) and histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs .Grade 3-4; HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.08, 0.8; p = 0.02).

25,"Topiramate and cortical excitability in humans: a study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered at 5 Hz frequency and suprathreshold intensity progressively increases the size of muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) and the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of topiramate (TPM) at different doses on cortical excitability variables tested with rTMS. We tested the facilitation of the MEP size and CSP duration evoked by focal rTMS in eight patients before and after treatment with TPM at different doses for chronic neuropathic pain. In each patient, rTMS (5 Hz frequency-120% resting motor threshold) was applied at baseline and during the TPM induction phase (drug intake schedule: week I 25 mg/day, week II 50 mg/day, week III 75 mg/day, week IV 100 mg/day) and total TPM plasma concentrations were measured. The effects on the MEP size of 5 Hz-rTMS delivered over repeated sessions were tested in eight control subjects. TPM had no effect on the resting motor threshold. Antiepileptic treatment at increasing doses abolished the normal rTMS-induced MEP facilitation. ANOVA showed that this was a dose-related effect. Accordingly, in patients receiving TPM at higher doses (75 and 100 mg) rTMS failed to elicit the MEP facilitation. TPM left the progressive lengthening of the CSP during the rTMS train unchanged. In control subjects, rTMS applied over repeated sessions elicited a constant increase in MEP size. Our results suggest that TPM modulates the excitatory intracortical interneurons probably by altering rTMS-induced synaptic potentiation. These drug-induced effects are related to TPM doses and plasma concentrations. In conclusion, rTMS may be useful for quantifying the effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs and for assessing individual responses to different drugs but acting through similar mechanisms, thus combining functional neurophysiological information and laboratory data.",Excluded

1156,"A method of surgical laser treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Introduction: If conservative therapy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia is ineffective, different kinds of destruction of peripheral branches (alcoholization, phenol destructions, electric coagulation, etc.) are commonly used with subsequent development of marked perifocal cicatricial-commissural changes. Material(s) and Method(s): On the basis of advantages of high-energy laser radiation, we developed a method for treating trigeminal neuralgia by means of puncture laser destruction (neurotomy) of peripheral trigeminal branches on different levels. At first, a peripheral branch was blocked; if there was a positive clinical effect in the form of disappearance or significant reduction of a colicky pain, an optical quartz fibre 200-400 nm in diameter was inserted through an internal lumen of an intraneurally placed injection needle. The above quartz optical fibre serves for laser radiation influence with wavelength of 980 nm in a continuous mode using fractional portions by 2-4 seconds with an interval of 8-10 seconds and radiation power from 2 to 7 W until deep or total anaesthesia was achieved in the innervation area of a relevant nerve. Depending upon the diameter of a nerve, from 200 to 600 J were required. If necessary, the position of a needle with an optical fibre was changed, thereby causing a new focus of laser destruction until the required degree of innervation was achieved. During one operation it was possible to carry out laser destruction (neurotomy) of several nerve trunks. Result(s): From April 2011 to May 2012, 30 patients received treatment with use of a method of laser neurotomy of peripheral trigeminal branches. A positive effect was achieved in 27 cases.

1201,"Intra-operative radiation therapy for malignant brain tumours: Rationale, method, and treatment results of cerebral glioblastomas. In radiation therapy for malignant brain tumours, the dose of radiation that can be safely delivered to a tumour is limited by the radiation tolerance of the adjacent normal brain tissue. Among various radiation modalities to produce local tumour eradication without unacceptable complications, we chose a large, single irradiation dose during the operation (intra-operative radiation therapy, IORT). In contrast to X-ray or Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiation, IORT with a high-energy electron beam delivered by the Shimadzu 20MeV betatron provides acceptable dose homogeneity with rapid fall-off of the radiation dose beyond the treatment volume. Thus, IORT has the advantage of precise demarcation of the target volume, minimum damage to surrounding normal tissues, and a high absorbed target dose (15-25Gy in 5-10min). On the basis of our experience with 170 patients treated by IORT, we established the treatment indications and method in patients with malignant brain tumours. IORT with a dose of 15-25 Gy was delivered to widely resected tumours followed by external radiation therapy. No acute or subacute complications were observed. Treatment results of 30 patients with glioblastoma treated by IORT (mean 18.3 Gy) combined with external radiation therapy (mean 58.5 Gy) resulted in a median survival of 119 weeks and a 2-year survival rate of 61%.",Excluded

We experienced a patient with photosensitive attacks induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Method(s): A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital because he experienced photosensitive attacks, which first occurred 3 months previously. In the case of our patient, sunlight always induced a photosensitive attack, during which he was blinded for approximately 10 minutes. He did not experience convulsions, loss of consciousness, headache, and symptoms of amaurosis. Ophthalmological examination, electroencephalography, and brain computed tomography (CT) did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient was exposed to cervical radiation for pharyngeal cancer approximately 16 years previously. He did not have migraine, diabetes, and any previous cerebrovascular disease. The patient had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which were not treated appropriately. Result(s): One month after visiting our hospital, he experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIA) with right hemiparesis. Thereafter, the patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed small cerebral infarctions. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no abnormalities; however, ultrasound of the carotid artery showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). Cerebral angiography also showed bilateral ICA stenosis (approximately 90%). A 99m-Technetium- ECD single-photon emission CT scan revealed low bilateral occipital perfusion. Because the bilateral ICA stenosis was induced by radiation, we decided to perform carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) instead of carotid endarterectomy. After CAS of the left carotid artery, the patient's photosensitivity completely disappeared. Conclusion(s): Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in achieving a partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to propose guidelines for optimal treatment Methods. During a 5-year period, 29 patients (19 male and 10 female) with 92 brain metastases from RCC underwent GKS. The median tumor volume was 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.5-14.5 cm<sup>3</sup>). Fourteen patients (48%) also underwent whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) before GKS, and two patients (6.8%) after GKS. The mean GKS dose delivered to the 50% isodose at the tumor margin was 16.8 Gy (range 13-30 Gy). All cases were categorized according to the Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification for brain metastases. Univariate analysis was performed to determine significant prognostic factors and survival. The overall median survival was 7 months after GKS treatment. Age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and controlled primary disease were not predictors of survival. Combined WBRT/GKS resulted in median survival of 18, 8.5, and 5.3 months for RPA Classes I, II, and III, respectively, compared with the median survival 7.1, 4.2, and 2.3 months for patients treated with WBRT alone. Conclusions. These results suggest that WBRT combined with GKS may improve survival in patients with brain metastases from RCC.

2593,"Effects of escitalopram challenge on white matter integrity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and healthy controls. Background: Involvement of the serotonergic system in OCD is well-known, with OCD responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Chronic use of SSRIs changes brain connectivity in OCD, and a single dose of an SSRI dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the brain in healthy subjects. The question is raised whether acute administration of an SSRI can also significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of patients with OCD. Method(s): OCD patients (n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=24) received a single dose of escitalopram 20mg on one day, and a single dose of placebo on another day, in randomized order, under double-blind conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to compare white matter integrity of the whole brain between the groups. The impact of the SSRI challenge on white matter in these two study groups were subsequently investigated, controlling for age. Result(s): There were no significant interaction effects (diagnostic group x pharmacological challenge) or effects in the OCD group separately. In controls, the escitalopram challenge had a significant impact on white matter diffusivity of the left post thalamic radiation (PTR-L) (F=7.84; p=0.01), the superior corona radiata bilaterally (SCR: F=7.99; p=0.01) and the sagittal stratum bilaterally (SS: F=6.64; p=0.02). In these tracts, FA was significantly higher and RD significantly lower after the pharmacological challenge compared to placebo. Discussion(s): Acute administration of an SSRI did not significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of OCD patients. It did however improve white matter integrity in tracts that connect regions that may be affected in OCD, in controls. DTI-derived parameters are differently affected in OCD and healthy controls, respectively, in structures within the fronto-striatothalamo-cortical loop after chronic SSRI treatment. Alteration of white matter integrity may occur in OCD with longer treatment duration or at a different dosage with plasticity potentially playing a role.",Excluded

Aims: Simultaneous dual-tracer brain imaging has the potential to shorten patient pathways in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, but the poor spectral resolution of conventional gamma cameras limits the utility of this technique. Solid state detectors offer improved capability to distinguish between two radioisotopes, and this has been exploited clinically in the field of nuclear cardiology. However, the technology has yet to be fully evaluated in the field of scintigraphic neuroimaging. We present imaging results for a new small-pixel CdTe detector in simultaneous dual-radioisotope scintigraphy of a brain phantom. Method(s): We have developed a new high-performance CdTe detector with an array of 80x80 pixels on a 250mum pitch, capable of imaging x-rays and gamma rays up to 200keV. The detector is fully spectroscopic, recording the energy of every interaction in each pixel of the detector, and the small pixel size affords very high spatial- and spectral- resolution. The detector has a wide range of applications in medical imaging, including x-ray diffraction tomography, x-ray k-edge subtraction and highresolution nuclear medicine imaging. The new detector has been characterised for radionuclide imaging. Using pinhole collimation, images have been acquired of a brain phantom containing both I-123 and Tc-99m. The hyperspectral dataset was subjected to corrections for inter-pixel charge sharing, variations in energy and uniformity response, and bad pixel interpolation. Images were created by applying energy windows to the spectral data. Images and spectra of the same phantom were also acquired with a conventional clinical gamma camera for comparison. For each image, the contrast and cross-talk between the two energy windows were quantified using regions of interest. Result(s): The CdTe system exhibits improved scatter rejection and greatly reduced cross-talk between the energy windows for the two radioisotopes, resulting in enhanced image contrast. These characteristics will allow for better accuracy for quantitative imaging in a dual-tracer setting, which has particular importance in brain imaging. We also demonstrate the ability of the detector to resolve low-energy fluorescence x-rays from the radioactive source. The system has a high efficiency for detection of these low-energy photons, and incorporating these events into image reconstruction may boost the sensitivity, reducing image noise. Conclusion(s): Small-pixel CdTe detectors are a promising prospect in multi-tracer SPECT imaging. We present future plans to develop the instrument, with a tiled array of detectors with minimal dead-space to increase the field of view and improved collimators to further increase the sensitivity of the system.",Excluded
1644,"Development of a novel animal model to differentiate radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence. Distinguishing tumor progression from radiation necrosis after treatment in patients with brain tumors presents a clinical dilemma. A well-characterized, orthotopic rodent model of radiation-induced brain necrosis including a tumor is not currently available The objective of the study was to create focal radiation necrosis in rat brain bearing human glioblastoma (GBM) using stereotactic radiosurgery and confirm it by immuno-histological analysis. Nude rats implanted with primary GBM cells were irradiated using a stereotactic setup (n = 3) or received no radiation (n = 3). Ten weeks after the implantation, growth of the tumor was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For each animal, MRI and contrast-enhanced CT images were obtained and fused using registration software. The tumor was identified and delineated using the fused CT/MR images. A treatment plan was generated using a 4 mm radiosurgery cone such that one portion of the tumor receives 100% dose of 60 Gy sufficient to cause necrosis, whereas the tumor edge at depth receives only 50% or less dose, allowing for regrowth of the tumor. The brains were collected 10 weeks after irradiation and immuno-histological analysis was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed central liquefaction necrosis in the high dose region consistent with necrosis and viable tumor in the peripheral low dose region. Ki-67 staining showed highly proliferative tumor cells surrounding the necrotic parts of the tumor. Luxol fast blue and lectin staining showed demyelination and vascular injury in brain tissue consistent with radiation necrosis. We have developed a novel model of radiation necrosis in rats bearing glioma.",Excluded
3200,"Contour variability during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment planning and the effect of physician training. Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate inter- and intra-observer contouring variability during treatment planning for stage I lung cancers treated with SBRT, and to assess the effect of contouring training for physicians. Materials/Methods: Nine radiation oncologists (3 attendings, 6 residents) contoured the lung tumor internal target volumes (ITVs) in 6 patients using maximum intensity projection (MIP) images after 4D-CT simulation. Contouring was performed independently at 3 separate time points: prior to training based on department standards, after completing contouring training, and >2 weeks after the second session. Contouring variability was evaluated for variations in the magnitude of volumes (coefficient of variation (COV) = standard deviation/mean volume), the volume overlap (conformality index (CI) = common volume/encompassing volume), and differences in the centroid location. Contours were also compared clinically to determine radiographic features resulting in larger disagreement. Result(s): The mean volumes in cm3 for session 1, 2 and 3 were 6.52, 6.98 and 7.20 respectively. The mean COV for sessions 1 (0.25 +/- 0.05), 2 (0.24 +/- 0.04) and 3 (0.19 +/- 0.03) demonstrated significant improvement from session 1 to 3 (p = 0.03) while the CI also improved with each session, 0.35 +/-0.07, 0.36 +/-0.03 and 0.44 +/-0.04, respectively (p = 0.03 from session 1 to 3). Average differences (mm) of the mean centroid positions in the lateral, anterior-posterior, and cranial-caudal directions demonstrated decreased variability from session 1, 0.3+/-0.3, 0.3+/-0.3 and 0.5+/-0.5, to session 3, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.3+/-0.3 respectively (p = ns). Differences in resident vs. attending COV 0.31+/-0.06 vs. 0.09+/-0.05 (p<0.001) and CI 0.37+/-0.08 vs. 0.69+/-0.03 (p<0.001) for session 1 and COV 0.20+/-0.04 vs. 0.19+/-0.05 (p = 0.78) and CI 0.50+/-0.05 vs. 0.63+/-0.05 (p = 0.002) for session 3 demonstrated training improved resident contouring towards attending levels. Intra-observer variability for sessions 1 vs. 2 and sessions 2 vs. 3 showed a non significant improvement in the differences between mean volumes 18%+/-13% vs. 11%+/-8% as well as CI 0.78+/-0.05 vs. 0.81+/-0.06. Conclusion(s): While there is large variation in contoured volumes, the centroid locations show excellent agreement. Intra- is smaller than interobserver variability; both can be improved with repeat contouring and standardized training, particularly in less experienced observers. Clinically, variability was most relevant for lesions with pleural attachments and spiculae suggesting a need for a standardized approach to contour such lesions.",Excluded
1779,"MR Gd-DTPA enhancement of radiation brain injury. MR examinations of 104 patients who had undergone radiotherapy to the brain were reviewed. Thirty-six patients received Gd-DTPA enhanced study during the course of MR evaluation and six of the patients showed enhancing radiation necrosis. Histopathological confirmations were obtained in three patients. Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation lesions were multiple and patchy in three patients, multiple and patchy with cyst formation in two and ring shaped in one. In terms of their distribution, enhancing lesions in four patients were seen only in the white matter within the irradiated field and these patients had undergone radiotherapy within five years. The interval after radiotherapy was more than eight years in two patients and their enhanced lesions were observed in both the white and gray matter. Histopathological findings of Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation necrosis were gliosis and coalescing vacuoles of the neural tissue. None of these enhanced radiation lesions showed significant mass effects. Patterns of the enhancement were not specific. It was considered to be difficult to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis with conventional Gd-DTPA enhanced MR examinations. In one patient, delayed MR images after Gd-DTPA administration showed increases in the size and number of radiation enhanced lesions. Dynamic and delayed MR study might add more information to conventional imaging after Gd-DTPA. Further studies are necessary to differentiate radiation lesions from tumor recurrences.",Excluded
580,"Targeting CREB inhibits radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation and increases radiation-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells. Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a process by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) cancer cells. Accumulated evidence suggests that NED is associated with disease progression and therapy resistance in prostate cancer patients. We previously reported that by mimicking a clinical radiotherapy protocol, fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR) induces NED in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, FIR-induced NED constitutes two distinct phases: a radioresistance phase in which a fraction of cells selectively survive during the first two week irradiation, and a neuroendocrine differentiation phase in which surviving cells differentiate into NE-like cancer cells during the second two week irradiation. We have also observed increased activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein during the course of FIR-induced NED. To determine whether targeting NED can be explored as a radiosensitization approach, we employed two CREB targeting strategies, CREB knockdown and overexpression of ACREB, a dominant-negative mutant of CREB, to target both phases. Our results showed that ACREB expression increased FIR-induced cell death and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Consistent with this, knockdown of CREB also inhibited FIR-induced NED and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Molecular analysis suggests that CREB targeting primarily increases radiation-induced pre-mitotic apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting NED could be developed as a radiosensitization approach for prostate cancer radiotherapy.",Excluded
3409,"11C-methionine-PET for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis: radiomics approach with random forest classifier. Differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis is often difficult. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of 11C-methionine (MET)-PET radiomics for distinguishing recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, as compared with conventional tumor-to-normal cortex (T/N) ratio evaluation. We enrolled 41 patients with metastatic brain tumor or glioma treated using radiation therapy who underwent MET-PET. The area with a standardized uptake value > 1.3 times that of the normal brain cortex was contoured. Forty-two PET features were extracted and used in a random forest classifier and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Gini index was measured to identify relevant PET parameters for classification. The reference standard was surgical histopathological analysis or more than 6 months of follow-up with MRI. Forty-four lesions were used for the analysis. Thirty-three and 11 lesions were confirmed as recurrent brain tumor and radiation necrosis, respectively. Radiomics and T/N ratio evaluation showed sensitivities of 90.1% and 60.6%, and specificities of 93.9% and 72.7% with areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.73, respectively. Gray level co-occurrence matrix dissimilarity was the most pertinent feature for diagnosis. MET-PET radiomics yielded excellent outcome for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, which outperformed T/N ratio evaluation.",Excluded
521,"Challenges and practicalities in the clinical implementation of Lutetium 177 for therapeutic nuclear medicine: A technologist's perspective. Objectives: FDA approval of Lutetium177 (Lu177) treatment of neuroendocrine tumor is pending. Lu177 therapy is logistically different than any other currently used radionuclide therapeutic agent. We aim to present a technologist's perspective on potential challenges related to the implementation of Lu177 therapy including developing an institution's policy, identifying needed location/space, supplies, and staff requirements. Method(s): A Lu177 treatment regimen consists of 4 intravenous infusions of 200 mCi at 8 week intervals. Each therapeutic infusion is 4-6 hours, consists of the Lu177 infusion along with an infusion of amino acids and requires nursing supervision. During this process, to reduce radiation exposure, the patient must walk to the restroom every thirty minutes with an IV pole to void. The technologists met with the Authorized Users (AU), the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), and the other staff involved to review the requirements of radiation safety, workflow, and protocol of this therapy. Result(s): The radioactive materials license is to be amended. It was determined that Lu177 administration would ideally occur in our PET division due to department layout and patient flow. While the general nuclear medicine department has an injection room suited for therapeutic use, the restroom is not in close proximity, which is a radiation safety concern. In our PET center, there are 2 comfortable injection rooms used for long uptake periods located next to a restroom dedicated for radioactive patients. Due to the stated length of the Lu177 therapy session, the PET diagnostic schedule will be reduced on Lu177 therapy days. Lu177 therapies will be scheduled in coordination with other departments including oncology; pharmacy for obtaining amino acids; and nursing for the administration of IV fluids and vital sign monitoring. After the infusion is completed and the injection room is cleaned, radioactive waste will be moved to long term storage. Conclusion(s): Lu177 therapy is an exciting new development in the field of radionuclide therapy: however, its implementation brings new challenges to meet both radiation safety and protocol requirements. Space, workflow, and staffing must all be considered. Lu177 therapies will involve the coordination of AUs, the RSO, technologists, nursing staff, pharmacist, and logistics personnel. Having a successful Lu177 therapy program requires team work to develop site-specific and tailored solutions.",Excluded

We investigated the possible combined genotoxic effects of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (900 MHz, amplitude modulated at 217 Hz, mobile phone signal) with the drinking water mutagen and carcinogen 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX). Female rats were exposed to RF fields for a period of 2 years for 2 h per day, 5 days per week at average whole-body specific absorption rates of 0.3 or 0.9 W/kg. MX was given in the drinking water at a concentration of 19 mug/ml. Blood samples were taken at 3, 6 and 24 months of exposure and brain and liver samples were taken at the end of the study (24 months). DNA damage was assessed in all samples using the alkaline comet assay, and micronuclei were determined in erythrocytes. We did not find significant genotoxic activity of MX in blood and liver cells. However, MX induced DNA damage in rat brain. Co-exposures to MX and RF radiation did not significantly increase the response of blood, liver and brain cells compared to MX exposure only. In conclusion, this 2-year animal study involving long-term exposures to RF radiation and MX did not provide any evidence for enhanced genotoxicity in rats exposed to RF radiation. © 2006 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
1822,"Feasibility of setting up generic alert levels for maximum skin dose in fluoroscopically guided procedures. Purpose: The feasibility of setting-up generic, hospital-independent dose alert levels to initiate vigilance on possible skin injuries in interventional procedures was studied for three high-dose procedures (chemoembolization (TACE) of the liver, neuro-embolization (NE) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) in 9 European countries. Method(s): Gafchromic films and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the Maximum Skin Dose (MSD). Correlation of the online dose indicators (fluoroscopy time, kerma- or dose-area product (KAP or DAP) and cumulative air kerma at interventional reference point (K<inf>a,r</inf>)) with MSD was evaluated and used to establish the alert levels corresponding to a MSD of 2 Gy and 5 Gy. The uncertainties of alert levels in terms of DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf>, and uncertainty of MSD were calculated. Result(s): About 20-30% of all MSD values exceeded 2 Gy while only 2-6% exceeded 5 Gy. The correlations suggest that both DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf> can be used as a dose indicator for alert levels (Pearson correlation coefficient p mostly >0.8), while fluoroscopy time is not suitable (p mostly <0.6). Generic alert levels based on DAP (Gy cm<sup>2</sup>) were suggested for MSD of both 2 Gy and 5 Gy (for 5 Gy: TACE 750, PCI 250 and NE 400). The suggested levels are close to the lowest values published in several other studies. The uncertainty of the MSD was estimated to be around 10-15% and of hospital-specific skin dose alert levels about 20-30% (with coverage factor k = 1). Conclusion(s): The generic alert levels are feasible for some cases but should be used with caution, only as the first approximation, while hospital-specific alert levels are preferred as the final approach.

2299,"Target delineation and optimal radiosurgical dose for pituitary tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivered as either single-fraction or multi-fraction SRS (2-5 fractions) is frequently employed in patients with residual or recurrent pituitary adenoma. The most common delivery systems used for SRS include the cobalt-60 system Gamma Knife, the CyberKnife (CK) robotic radiosurgery system, or a modified conventional radiotherapy machine (linear accelerator, LINAC). Tumor control and normalization of hormone hypersecretion have been reported in 75-100 % and 25-80 % of patients, respectively. Hypopituitarism is the most commonly reported late complication of radiation treatment, whereas other toxicities occur less frequently. We have provided an overview of the recent available literature on SRS in patients with a pituitary adenoma. Critical aspects of pituitary irradiation, including target delineation and doses to organs at risk, optimal radiation dose, as well as the long-term efficacy and toxicity of SRS for either nonfunctioning or secreting pituitary adenomas are discussed. Single-fraction SRS represents an effective treatment for patients with a pituitary adenoma; however, caution should be used for lesions > 2.5-3 cm in size and/or involving the anterior optic pathway. Future studies will be necessary to optimize target doses and critical organ dose constrains in order to reduce the long-term toxicity of treatments while maintaining high efficacy.",Excluded
2247,"Skilled motor learning does not enhance long-term depression in the motor cortex in vivo. Learning of motor skills may occur as a consequence of changes in the efficacy of synaptic connections in the primary motor cortex. We investigated if learning in a reaching task affects the excitability, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity of horizontal connections in layers II-III of the motor cortex. Because training in this task requires animals to be food-deprived, we compared the trained animals with similarly food-deprived untrained animals and normal controls. The results show that the excitability, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity of the studied horizontal connections were unaffected by motor learning. However, stress-related effects produced by food deprivation and handling significantly enhanced the expression of long-term depression in these pathways. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the acquisition of a complex motor skill produces bi-directional changes in synaptic strength that are distributed throughout the complex neural networks of motor cortex, which remains synaptically balanced during learning. The results are incompatible with the idea that learning causes large unidirectional changes in the population response of these neural networks, which may occur instead during certain behavioral states, such as stress.",Excluded
2201,"Tolerances on MLC leaf position accuracy for IMRT delivery with a dynamic MLC. The objective determination of performance standards for radiation therapy equipment requires, ideally, establishing the quantitative relationship between performance deviations and clinical outcome or some acceptable surrogate. In this simulation study the authors analyzed the dosimetric impact of random (leaf by leaf) and systematic (entire leaf bank) errors in the position of the MLC leaves on seven clinical prostate and seven clinical head and neck IMRT plans delivered using a dynamic MLC. In-house software was developed to incorporate normally distributed errors of up to +/- 2 mm in individual leaf position or systematic errors (+/- 1 and +/- 0.5 mm in all leaves of both leaf banks or +1 mm in one bank only) into the 14 plans, thus simulating treatment delivery using a suboptimally performing MLC. The dosimetric consequences of suboptimal MLC performance were quantified using the equivalent uniform doses (EUDs) of the clinical target volumes and important organs at risk (OARs). The deviation of the EUDs of the selected structures as the performance of the MLC deteriorated was used as the objective surrogate of clinical outcome. Random errors of 2 mm resulted in negligible changes for all structures of interest in both sites. In contrast, systematic errors can lead to potentially significant dosimetric changes that may compromise clinical outcome. If a 2% change in EUD of the target and 2 Gy for the OARs were adopted as acceptable levels of deviation in dose due to MLC effects alone, then systematic errors in leaf position will need to be limited to 0.3 mm. This study provides guidance, based on a dosimetric surrogate of clinical outcome, for the development of one component, leaf position accuracy of performance standards for multileaf collimators.",Excluded

The pineal gland of Sprague-Dawley rats housed under a LD regime (n=42) for four weeks and of a regime (n=42) for eight weeks were sampled at six different times, every 4 h (n=7 animals per time point), during a 24 h period. Total RNA was extracted from each sample, and the semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine temporal changes in mRNA levels of Clock and NAT genes during different circadian or zeitgeber times. The data and parameters were analyzed by the cosine function software, Clock Lab software, and the amplitude F test was used to reveal the circadian rhythm. In the DD or LD condition, both the Clock and NAT mRNA levels in the pineal gland showed robust circadian oscillation (p<0.05) with the peak at the subjective night or at nighttime. In comparison with the DD regime, the amplitudes and mRNA levels at the peaks of Clock and NAT expressions in LD in the pineal gland were significantly reduced (p<0.05). In the DD or LD condition, the circadian expressions of NAT were similar in pattern to those of Clock in the pineal gland (p>0.05). These findings indicate that the transcriptions of Clock and NAT genes in the pineal gland not only show remarkably synchronous endogenous circadian rhythmic changes, but also respond to the ambient light signal in a reduced manner.",Excluded
1069,"Firing rates and dynamic correlated activities of ganglion cells both contribute to retinal information processing. In the present study, the electrical activities of paired retinal ganglion cells, under full field light stimuli with a variety of chromatic configurations, were recorded from a small functioning piece of retina using multi-electrode array (MEA). Neurons that had increased firings at light-ON and -OFF transients and did not show color-opponent properties were investigated. Single neuronal analysis showed that firing rate of each individual neuron was dependent on the intensity of illumination. Multi-unit analyses revealed that adjacent neurons often fired in synchrony in response to light stimulation. However, in some cases, the strength of correlation between the paired neurons was higher when the retina was exposed to red or green light, and the correlation was attenuated when yellow or white light was given. This seems to suggest that the ensemble activity of non-color-opponent ganglion cells might partly participate in color-information processing, with the red- and green-pathway inputs influencing each other. Such arrangement reflects principle of parsimony: the firing rates of single neuron represent the luminance intensity, and the correlated activities may tell the brain about the color information.",Excluded
883,"Autopsy report of a late delayed radiation injury after a period of 45 years. For delayed radiation injury, image analysis has considerably advanced, but neuropathological findings are still required to establish diagnosis. A patient who had received radiation therapy for pineal germinoma at age 14 developed neurological and psychiatric abnormalities after 15 years as a late delayed radiation injury. Autopsy at age 59 revealed diffuse changes in the white matter consisting in order of severity of myelin pallor, demyelination, and necrosis which were characterized by a lack of glial reaction. The cerebral cortex was relatively well preserved. As delayed radiation injuries, hyalinous changes in the vascular wall, angiomatous lesions and, fresh and old petechial hemorrhages were found. Moreover, vascular changes associated with arteriosclerosis were also present. Furthermore, a focal glial nodule was detected which was considered to be a new radiation-induced neoplasia. These findings suggest that late delayed radiation injury may slowly develop over 30 years and may involve damage to neuroglial stem cell compensation. It is also evident that arteriosclerotic changes and newly induced neoplasia may develop in delayed radiation injury cases.",Excluded
1448,"First-in-human phase 0 trial of oral 5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose (IPDR) in patients with advanced malignancies. Background: Iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd or IUDR), a halogenated nucleoside analog, has produced responses in patients with high-grade anaplastic astrocytomas and sarcomas when administered as a radiosensitizer via continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion over the course of radiation therapy. Since continuous i.v. infusion is impractical for several weeks of radiotherapy, we conducted a phase 0 trial of IPdR, an oral prodrug of IdUrd, in patients (pts) with advanced malignances. Prior to embarking on large-scale clinical trials, our objective was to determine whether the oral route was a feasible alternative to continuous i.v. infusion. Plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and other metabolites were measured after a single oral dose of IPdR. Trial design: Eligible pts had advanced refractory malignancies; age >=18 years; ECOG PS <= 2; adequate organ function; were at least 2 weeks from prior anticancer therapy. All pts verbalized their understanding of the non-therapeutic nature of the trial prior to signing the consent form. A single oral dose of IPdR was administered per pt; dose escalations were planned (150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg, 2400 mg) with one pt per dose level and 6 pts at the highest dose level. Blood sampling was performed over a 24-hour period for pharmacokinetic analysis. All pts were followed for 14 days for safety assessments. Significant toxicities were defined as grade >=2 non-hematologic toxicities; grade >=2 thrombocytopenia; grade >=3 anemia, leucopenia, or neutropenia. If one pt developed significant toxicity, no additional patients were to be enrolled. Result(s): There were no drug-related adverse events. Ten pts were enrolled; median age 60 yrs (range 45-66 yrs); M/F 8/2; diagnosis (# of pts): thyroid (2), lymphoma (1), neuroendocrine (1), hepatocellular (1), adenoid cystic (1), bladder (1), colorectal (2), breast cancer (1). A dosedependent increase in the plasma concentration was observed for IdUrd from 150 mg to 2400 mg. At the 2400 mg dose, all 6 pts achieved peak IdUrd levels of (mean+/-SD) 4.0+/-1.02mM (25% CV) at 1.67+/-1.21 h. Peak levels of iodouracil, the major metabolite, were 133+/-42mM at 3.3+/-1.0 h post IPdR administration. Conclusion(s): Single-dose oral IPdR was well tolerated, and adequate plasma levels were obtained to justify proceeding with a phase I trial of IPdR in combination with radiation. This clinical investigation clearly demonstrates the ability of a small phase 0 study to determine the critical information that can shape the path for decision-making regarding future development of a drug.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) is the only proven treatment for in-stent restenosis (ISR). It is, however, associated with a significant failure rate. The present study evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent ISR.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients who failed a previous radiation treatment, presented with angina and angiographic evidence of ISR, and were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and repeat radiation to the same segment were studied. Twenty-five patients were treated with gamma radiation in a dose of 15 Gy, and 26 were treated with beta radiation doses of 18.3 to 23 Gy. The mean cumulative dose for this cohort was 39.5+/-11.9 Gy (range, 29 to 75.6 Gy). The outcomes of those patients were compared with outcomes of 299 patients who also failed initial radiation but were treated with repeat conventional PCI to a previously irradiated segment without repeat radiation. At 9 months after treatment, the repeat-IRT group had lower rates of target lesion revascularization (23.5% versus 54.6%; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiac events, including target vessel revascularization (29.4% versus 61.3%; P<0.001).

Objective: Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the endometrium (NECE) accounts for only 0.8% of all endometrial carcinoma. The limited literature consists of case reports and small case series, with the largest including 25 patients. We performed a population-based study to describe disease course, treatment, and survival in women with NECE compared to endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC). Method(s): The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify women with NECE and women with poorly differentiated EC from 2004 to 2015. The cohort was limited to women with histologic confirmation and who received hysterectomy without neoadjuvant therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were developed to compare survival between groups using a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were fit to analyze associations between survival and histology while adjusting for clinical and demographic differences. Result(s): A total of 28,291 women with EC and 364 women with NECE were identified. More women with neuroendocrine tumors were non-white and presented with later stage disease (P < 0.05 for both). Stage III-IV tumors were diagnosed in 56% of women with NECE versus 26% of women with EC (P < 0.001). Women with NECE were more likely to receive chemotherapy (60% vs 30%, P < 0.001), but were less likely to receive radiation (28% vs 48%, P < 0.001). In a multivariable model, women with NECE were more than twice as likely to die than those with EC tumors (HR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.85-2.84). Similar trends were noted in analyses limited to stage I (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02-2.57) and stage III (HR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.91-3.61) neoplasms.

1438,"The white 'matter' in obsessive compulsive disorder: Effect of pharmacological treatment and symptom dimensions models. Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is highly heterogeneous in its manifestations, both across patients and within the same patient over time. The disorder is probably best described by a multidimensional model involving several symptom dimensions, whose precise number and phenotypes are debated. This heterogeneity partly explains, beyond methodological discrepancies, the inconsistency of results in current brain imaging research in the disorder, particularly in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Purpose(s): We aimed at investigating white matter (WM) alterations associated with OCD, controlling for the impact of variables known to affect WM structure, and specifically for the effect of current and lifetime pharmacological treatment. Then, we tested two different symptom dimensions models [1,2] within OCD patients, analysing theirWMcorrelates, for both prevailing current symptom dimension and symptom dimension at onset. Method(s): We compared 58 adult pure-OCD patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC), with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics on diffusion tensor images, using TFCE correction (p = 0.05). With respect to symptom dimensions, separate analyses were carried on the sole OCD sample. The diffusion measures Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were used as parameters of WM organisation. Result(s): The observed differences between OCD patients and HC were totally carried by the effect of previous and current medications. No differences were in fact observed between drugna ive patients and HC. Current medication was associated with a widespread decrease of FA and increase of RD throughout the whole brain. Lifetime treatment was associated with a decrease in FA in the tracts surrounding the thalami, site of major neurotransmitter alteration in OCD. In the analysis of symptom dimensions, only a finer-grained five-factors model [2] allowed for the identification of specific neural correlates. Patients having current Symmetry/Perfectionism dimension show a reduction in RD and MD in the body of corpus callosum and in left higher-order visual association tracts, including: left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and/or inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, patients having Doubt/Checking dimension at onset show a widespread reduction of AD, encompassing corpus callosum, and bilaterally the thalamic radiations, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Finally, patients having Rituals/Superstition dimension at onset show an increase in FA in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits: genu of corpus callosum, bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations and left external capsule. Conclusion(s): Present results confirm the effect of medications on WM in OCD [3], showing a large effect of current treatment on myelination and a site-specific, disorder-specific, effect of medications on brain systems. Furthermore, our findings provide support to a multidimensional model of OCD, and indicate that the distinction of clinically homogeneous dimensions is essential for the identification of reliable neural correlates. Finally, we evidence, to our knowledge for the first time, that onset symptom dimensions are associated with enduring alterations of WM structure. Onset symptom dimensions may reflect underlying endophenotypes, and our results suggest their relevance for future investigations on OCD neuroanatomy and aetiopathology.",Excluded

3132,"[Interactive determination of the parameters of mathematical models in planning radiotherapy of malignant tumors. 3. Method of local adjustment of the parameters of mathematical models (examples of application)]. To increase the accuracy of calculation of tolerance doses of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in normal organs and tissues by using mathematical models, the author has developed a method for local mathematical model parameter adjustment (LMMPA) which included analysis of the structure of a mathematical model, systematization of clinical information and its goal-oriented use to determine the parameters of a model. The necessity of developing the LMMPA method stemmed from the complexity of the body exposed to radiation a system and from the quest for taking into account the impact of the system on the values of mathematical models. LMMPA may be regarded as the extension of determination of the parameters of mathematical models or as the interactive determination of their parameters that describing radiation exposures of complex biological systems. Different aspects of using of LMMPA are indicated how to apply it to the determination of tolerance doses for connective tissue, lung tissue, and the brain by using the Ellis and LQ models. The extended LMMPA is shown how to determine the parameters of a mathematical models for calculation of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in the lung tissue.",Excluded

2964,"Evaluating the influence of setup uncertainties on treatment planning for focal liver tumors. PURPOSE: A mechanism has been developed to evaluate the influence of random setup variations on dose during treatment planning. The information available for studying these factors shifts from population-based models toward patient-specific data as treatment progresses and setup measurements for an individual patient become available. This study evaluates the influence of population as well as patient-specific setup distributions on treatment plans for focal liver tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients with focal liver tumors were treated on a protocol that involved online setup measurement and adjustment, as well as ventilatory immobilization. Summary statistics from these three-dimensional conformal treatments yielded individual and population distributions of position at initial setup for each fraction. A convolution model for evaluation of the influence of random setup variation on calculated dose distributions has been previously described and investigated for application to focal liver radiotherapy by our department. Individual patient doses based on initial setup positions were calculated by convolving the calculated dose distribution with an anisotropic probability distribution function representing the individual patient's random variations. A separate convolution using population-averaged random variations was performed. Individual beam apertures were then adjusted to provide plans that ensured proper dose to the clinical target volume following convolution with population distributions, as well as individual patient position uncertainty models.RESULTS: Individual patient setup distributions for the course of treatment had random setup variations (sigma) that ranged from 2.5 to 5.7 mm (left-right), 2.1 to 8.3 mm (anterior-posterior), and 4.1 to 10.8 mm (cranial-caudal). The population random components were 4.2 mm (left-right), 4.1 mm (anterior-posterior), and 7.0 mm (cranial-caudal) at initial setup. The initial static planned dose distribution overestimated the volume of liver irradiated to high doses, because inclusion of setup uncertainties generally blurred the resulting doses, shifting the higher-dose region of normal liver dose-volume histograms to lower doses. Furthermore, the population-based dose convolution tended to predict a higher risk of radiation damage to the liver (based on an in-house parameterization of the Lyman normal tissue complication probability model) than the individual patient calculations. For an individual plan, application of different individual random variations yielded change in effective volume differences with a 3% range. Plan adjustment to account for random setup variations generally resulted in a lower change in effective volume than initial planning using a planning target volume followed by calculation of delivered dose based on random offsets.CONCLUSION: This study hints at the factors that most strongly influence planning of liver treatments taking into account geometric variations. Given a setup verification methodology that rapidly reduces systematic offsets, the importance of realistic incorporation of geometric variations as an initial step in treatment planning, as well as possible plan refinement, is demonstrated.",Excluded
295,"Orientation illusions in spaceflight. Investigations of spontaneous illusory reactions were carried out during space-flights of various durations by ANKETA questionnaires (104 cosmonauts). From a total of 104 cosmonauts, 24, in addition, used a dictaphone to record a verbal description of the illusions and their sensations on tape. Analysis of data generated by ANKETA and the tapes thus recorded have shown that during adaptation to weightlessness, 98% of cosmonauts have noted the occurrence of various illusions of orientation (coordinate and kinetic): illusions pertaining to their position or illusions of self- and surround-motion. The development of spatial orientation illusions during and after flight is not limited to certain individuals, but is a general response of the sensory system to microgravity. These responses differ to some extent among individuals in severity, nature, time and duration of occurrence, and the dynamics of the process. Perceptual disorders may occur even if the cosmonaut feels well and experiences no anomalous autonomic reactions. The nature of spatial illusions was determined by the role and relative contribution of various types of sensory input to spatial orientation. After completion of the initial stage of adaptation to weightlessness, the perceptual disorders disappear. However, spontaneous illusory reactions were often observed after 50 days of exposure to weightlessness. The adaptation process during long-term spaceflight had an undulating course, in which adaptation and de-adaptation alternated. A classification of weightlessness illusions is proposed.",Excluded
511,"Gamma knife surgery for cavernous hemangiomas: an analysis of 125 patients. OBJECT: The authors sought to determine the value of gamma knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cavernous hemangiomas (CHs).METHODS: Between 1993 and 2002, a total of 125 patients with symptomatic CHs were treated with GKS. Ninety-seven patients presented with bleeding and 45 of these had at least two bleeding episodes. Thirteen patients presented with seizures combined with hemorrhage, and 15 patients presented with seizures alone. The mean margin dose of radiation was 12.1 Gy and the mean follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the 112 patients who had bled the number of rebleeds after GKS was 32. These rebleeds were defined both clinically and based on magnetic resonance imaging for an annual rebleeding rate of 32 episodes/492 patient-years or 6.5%. Twenty-three of the 32 rebleeding episodes occurred within 2 years after GKS. Nine episodes occurred after 2 years; thus, the annual rebleeding rate after GKS was 10.3% for the first 2 years and 3.3% thereafter (p = 0.0038). In the 45 patients with at least two bleeding episodes before GKS, the rebleeding rate dropped from 29.2% (55 episodes/188 patient-years) before treatment to 5% (10 episodes/197 patient-years) after treatment (p < 0.0001). Among the 28 patients who presented with seizures, 15 (53%) had good outcomes (Engel Grades I and II). In this study of 125 patients, symptomatic radiation-induced complications developed in only three patients.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife surgery can effectively reduce the rebleeding rate after the first symptomatic hemorrhage in patients with CH. In addition, GKS may be useful in reducing the severity of seizures in patients with CH.",Excluded

A specific absorption rate (SAR) measurements system has been developed for compliance testing of personal mobile phone in a brain phantom material contained in a Perspex box. The volume of the box has been chosen corresponding to the volume of a small rat and illuminated by a 3G mobile phone frequency (1718.5 MHz), and the emitted radiation directed toward brain phantom. The induced fields in the phantom material are measured. Set up to lift the plane carrying the mobile phone is run by a pulley whose motion is controlled by a stepper motor. The platform is made to move at a pre-determined rate of 2degree per min limited up to 20degree. The measured data for induced fields in various locations are used to compute corresponding SAR values and inter comparison obtained. These data are also compared with those when the mobile phone is placed horizontally with respect to the position of the animal. The SAR data is also experimentally obtained by measuring a rise in temperature due to this mobile exposures and data compared with those obtained in the previous set. To seek a comparison with the safety criteria same set of measurements are performed in 10 g phantom material contained in a cubical box. These results are higher than those obtained with the knowledge of induced field measurements. It is concluded that SAR values are sensitive to the angular position of the moving platform and are well below the safety criteria prescribed for human exposure.

420,"Targeting PARP-1 with alpha-particles is potently cytotoxic to human neuroblastoma in preclinical models. Alpha-emitters can be pharmacologically delivered for irradiation of single cancer cells, but cellular lethality could be further enhanced by targeting alpha-emitters directly to the nucleus. PARP-1 is a druggable protein in the nucleus that is overexpressed in neuroblastoma compared with normal tissues and is associated with decreased survival in high-risk patients. To exploit this, we have functionalized a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) with an alpha-emitter astatine-211. This approach offers enhanced cytotoxicity from conventional PARPis by not requiring enzymatic inhibition of PARP-1 to elicit DNA damage; instead, the alpha-particle directly induces multiple double-strand DNA breaks across the particle track. Here, we explored the efficacy of [<sup>211</sup>At]MM4 in multiple cancers and found neuroblastoma to be highly sensitive in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, alpha-particles delivered to neuroblastoma show antitumor effects and durable responses in a neuroblastoma xenograft model, especially when administered in a fractionated regimen.

Currently there are no established targeted therapies in SCLC and the aim of this study was to examine for the presence of known molecular targets in patients with SCLC. Method(s): A panel of histopathologically proven formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens of SCLC diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 were analysed for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF mutations, ALK gene rearrangements and MET amplification. EGFR and KRAS testing were done using real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR cobas), BRAF and NRAS using capillary electrophoresis-single strand conformation analysis (CE-SSCA) and ALK and MET using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Any positive results were repeated for confirmation. Any inconsistent results were sequenced using the direct Sanger sequencing. . Result(s): A hundred and five cases of SCLC were identified and 75 FFPE blocks retrieved. Sixty samples were suitable for molecular testing, with 25 examined for all 6 molecular targets successfully. No mutations in EGFR were detected in 31 cases suitable for analysis. KRAS and NRAS mutational analysis was successful in 35 and 37 cases respectively; all of which were wild type. Fifty-eight cases were assessed for ALK gene rearrangements and 42 cases for MET gene amplifications; no rearrangements or amplifications were detected. Forty-seven samples were successfully analysed for BRAF gene mutation, with one V600E mutation detected (2.1% of cases). This patient was a 55 years old Caucasian male smoker who was diagnosed as SCLC, limited stage. He had a history of squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed 6 months prior to the SCLC diagnosis (treated by lobectomy). He responded well to his SCLC treatment (radical chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation). He died nine months after diagnosis. Conclusion(s): EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, ALK and MET were not detected in the examined panel of SCLC patients.

Electroporation-based treatments typically consist of the application of high-voltage dc pulses. As an undesired side effect, these dc pulses cause electrical stimulation of excitable tissues such as motor nerves. The present in vivo study explores the use of bursts of sinusoidal voltage in a frequency range from 50 kHz to 2 MHz, to induce irreversible electroporation (IRE) whilst avoiding neuromuscular stimulation. A series of 100 dc pulses or sinusoidal bursts, both with an individual duration of 100 micros, were delivered to rabbit liver through thin needles in a monopolar electrode configuration, and thoracic movements were recorded with an accelerometer. Tissue samples were harvested three hours after treatment and later post-processed to determine the dimensions of the IRE lesions. Thermal damage due to Joule heating was ruled out via computer simulations. Sinusoidal bursts with a frequency equal to or above 100 kHz did not cause thoracic movements and induced lesions equivalent to those obtained with conventional dc pulses when the applied voltage amplitude was sufficiently high. IRE efficacy dropped with increasing frequency. For 100 kHz bursts, it was estimated that the electric field threshold for IRE is about 1.4 kV cm<sup>-1</sup> whereas that of dc pulses is about 0.5 kV cm<sup>-1</sup>.",Excluded
3062,"Acute abdominal pain: is there a potential role for MRI in the setting of the emergency department in a patient with renal calculi?. Acute flank pain is a frequent clinical presentation encountered in emergency departments, and a work-up for obstructive urolithiasis in this setting is a common indication for computed tomography (CT). However, imaging alternatives to CT for the evaluation of renal colic are warranted in some clinical situations, such as younger patients, pregnancy, patients that have undergone multiple prior CT exams and also patients with vague clinical presentations. MRI, although relatively insensitive for the direct detection of urinary calculi, has the ability to detect the secondary effects of obstructive urolithiasis. Using rapid, single shot T2-weighted sequences without and with fat saturation provides an abdominopelvic MR examination that can detect the sequelae of clinically active stone disease, in addition to alternate inflammatory processes that may mimic the symptoms of renal colic. In addition, MR nephro-urography (MRNU) has the ability to provide quantitative analysis of renal function that has the potential to direct clinical management in the setting of obstructing calculi.

Between September 10, 1973 and May 20, 1975, 94 selected patients were treated with fast neutron beams generated by bombarding an ""intermediate"" beryllium target with 21 MeV deuterons. The clinical material included: 58 patients with head and neck cancers; 27 patients with cerebral glioblastoma multiforme; and 9 patients with a variety of other neoplasms. Of the 67 patients treated only with neutron beams, 31 received two increments per week and 36 received three increments per week. The calculated doses in most patients were 1800 rad n gamma (neutrons + gamma components) delivered in 6 weeks. Seventeen patients were treated with two increments of neutron beams and three increments of 60Co photons weekly to calculated total doses of 780-1050 rad n gamma + 3360-3780 rad 60Co gamma delivered over 50-54 days.

1016,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a protective effect of nicaraven in ionizing radiation- and ara-C-induced cell death. BACKGROUND: Nicaraven is a drug used for patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured.RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP.DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.",Excluded

This article presents the results of 123 patients treated for a brain AVM at the Gamma Knife Center ULB-Hopital Erasme. Radiosurgical treatment is proposed following multidisciplinary discussion of the best therapeutic strategy based on specific parameters of the AVM. Gamma Knife irradiation was achieved for an AVM residue after endovascular embolization for 84 % of patients, after microsurgery for 7 % of patients, or after previous radiosurgical irradiation for 6 % of patients. The whole volume of the nidus was irradiated in a single session for all patients. A mean margin dose of 22.3 Gy was delivered to the nidus, which had a mean volume of 3.3 cc. The maximum dose ranged from 30 Gy to 50 Gy (mean 44.1 Gy). All patients were prospectively followed after treatment with serial angio-MR and/or conventional angiography. A retrospective analysis shows complete obliteration of the AVM for 109 patients (89 %) after 6 to 52 months (mean 32 months). For 14 patients the nidus was only partially obliterated from the radiosurgical procedure; for 9 patients a second irradiation was performed with subsequent complete occlusion of the AVM in all cases. So, 118 of 123 patients (96 %) irradiated by Gamma Knife in 1 or 2 sessions were cured. Four patients bled after irradiation and before complete occlusion of the AVM, with neurological deficit for 2 patients. Transient neurological symptoms develop after treatment for 12 patients (10 %), associated with postradic edema treated with corticoids. Permanent neurological worsening occurred in5 patients (4 %). Gamma Knife treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations is a highly efficient and low-risk therapy when used by a multidisciplinary team.",Excluded

There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, fluoroscopy time, contrast dose, radiation exposure, catheter exchanges, technical success, transfemoral conversion, technical or access-site complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, other complications, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The authors' results suggest that RA TR CAS is feasible, safe, and effective. Neurovascular-specific engineering and software modifications are needed prior to complete remote control. Remote control has important implications regarding patient access to lifesaving procedures for conditions such as stroke and aneurysm rupture as well as operative precision. Future clinical investigations among larger cohorts are needed to demonstrate reliable performance and patient benefit. Copyright © AANS 2021.",Excluded
2267,"DASL-HiCaP: Darolutamide augments standard therapy for localized very high-risk cancer of the prostate (ANZUP1801)-A randomized phase III doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of adding darolutamide to androgen deprivation therapy and definitive or salvage radiation. Background: Radiation therapy (RT), plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHA), is standard of care for men with very high-risk localized prostate cancer (PC), or with very high- risk features and persistent PSA after radical prostatectomy (RP). Despite this, incurable distant metastases develop within 5 years in 15% of men with very high-risk features. Darolutamide is a structurally distinct oral androgen receptor antagonist with low blood-brain-barrier penetration, a demonstrated favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of adding darolutamide to ADT and RT in the setting of either primary definitive therapy, or adjuvant therapy for very high-risk PC. Method(s): This study is a randomized (1:1) phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for men planned for RT who have very high-risk localized PC; or very high-risk features with PSA persistence or rise within one year following RP. The trial will be stratified by: RP; use of adjuvant docetaxel; pelvic nodal involvement. 1100 participants will be randomized to darolutamide 600 mg or placebo twice daily for 96 weeks. Participants will receive LHRHA for 96 weeks, plus RT starting week 8-24 from randomisation. Participants are allowed nonsteroidal antiandrogen (up to 90 days) in addition to LHRHA up until randomisation. Early treatment with up to 6 cycles of docetaxel completed at least 4 weeks prior to RT is permitted. The primary endpoint is metastasis-free survival (ICECaP-validated), with secondary endpoints overall survival, PC-specific survival, PSA-progression free survival, time to subsequent hormonal therapy, time to castrationresistance, frequency and severity of adverse events, health related quality of life, fear of recurrence. Tertiary endpoints include incremental cost-effectiveness, and identification of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of treatment response, safety and resistance to study treatment.",Excluded
3499,"How the use of CBCT and MRI has changed our management of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma remains a clinical diagnosis but today imaging has become an important cornerstone in the diagnostic work-up of this condition. Conebeam CT offers a much higher resolution of the interface between bone, air and soft tissue, while the associated irradiation dose is substantially lower, as compared to multi-detector CT scans. As such, CBCT has become very useful for the pre-op work-up of patients with cholesteatoma showing with precision bony erosion of the ossicular chain and erosion of the petrous bone (as fistulae, perilabyrinthine erosion, intracranial invasion). Also the aeration of theME-cleft is shown (important for the functional prognosis) and important preoperative landmarks warn the surgeon for eventual pitfalls. The advent of the non-EP diffusion weighted sequence in MR-imaging makes this sequence a very useful adjunctive tool in the pre-op work-up of cholesteatoma cases specially in cases suspected of intralabyrinthine spread, or extension medial to the otic capsule or intracranial invasion. Its today almost undisputed value has been demonstrated in the postoperative follow-up of cholesteatoma by the high sensitivity and specificity (in most studies well above 90%). By this innovation many ""unnecessary"" (because absence of residual pathology) second stage operations can today be avoided. Advantages and limitations of the two imaging techniques will be discussed. An algorithm usefull in clinical practice will be proposed.",Excluded
426,"NF-kappa B signaling pathway as a target for human tumor radiosensitization. NF-kappa B is a critical nuclear transcriptional factor that is activated in response to cellular stresses and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell death. When regulated NF-kappa B activation is disrupted, cells undergo apoptosis. That is, constitutively elevated or dysregulated NF-kappa B activation leads to cell death in response to stress. These mechanisms have been shown experimentally by expressing dominant negative inhibitors of NF-kappa B (I kappa B-alpha) in cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents or to ionizing radiation. NF-kappa B also plays an important role in a novel, radiation-inducible signaling pathway that involves the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase. Cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation and exhibit impaired NF-kappa B activation in response to this stress. Restoration of NF-kappa B regulation in AT fibroblasts by introducing a dominant negative form of I kappa B-alpha has resulted in correction of radiation sensitivity and a reduction of ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. Expression of introduced ATM in AT cells results in correction of NF-kappa B regulation and an increase in postradiation survival without reduction in radiation-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these observations support a central role for NF-kappa B regulation in cellular intrinsic radiation sensitivity and apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the signaling pathway involving ATM/NF-kappa B/I kappa B offers attractive potential molecular targets for radiation sensitization in strategies to enhance the therapeutic ratio in cancer treatment.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Simple resection of diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint is associated with local recurrence rates as high as 50%. Thus, adjuvant treatment modalities, such as radiation or intra-articular isotope injection, are sometimes used after tumor resection. Our initial and highly satisfactory experience with the injection of radioactive yttrium 90 to treat pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint eroded with time so much so that we discontinued its use in the ankle and believe that it is important to alert our colleagues to the complications that we observed.METHODS: Between 1989 and 2006, we treated seven patients who had diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint with subtotal synovectomy followed by intra-articular injection of 15 mCi of yttrium 90.RESULTS: Two of the study patients had full-thickness skin necrosis develop around the injection site, necessitating free muscle flap transfer within three months of treatment, and a third patient had development of a draining sinus that was associated with chronic severe pain. The other four patients reported pain after the injection that was reasonably controlled by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. At the most recent follow-up evaluation, no study patient had recurrent disease.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the unacceptably high rate of serious complications associated with the injection of yttrium 90 into the ankle joint following subtotal synovectomy, we discontinued its use as a local adjuvant in the management of diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle.",Excluded

3094,"Radiation in the management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Background: Radiation therapy (RT) has not historically been incorporated into multidisciplinary management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs). We provide a two-institution series of patients with PNTs who were treated with external beam RT either neoadjuvantly to attempt down-staging for surgery, or in the setting of post-surgical recurrence. Our objective was to assess treatment response and outcomes in this cohort of patients. Method(s): We identified eleven patients with a pathologic diagnosis of PNT from 2006-2011 who received external beam RT to the primary tumor or resection bed. Each institution's electronic medical record was used to evaluate patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment regimens and tolerance, radiographic response, and survival. Result(s): Our series consists of eleven patients (6 men, 5 women) with a mean age of 57 years (range 37-72 years). All had biopsy proven PNT and were clinically T3 (n=3) or T4 (n=8), M0. Five patients were clinically node positive. All patients received RT to the primary tumor or resection bed to a median dose of 50.4 Gy. Seven patients received concurrent chemotherapy with capecitabine at a median dose of 1000mg/m<sup>2</sup> bid. Nine patients were treated definitively for locally advanced disease, two of whom subsequently underwent surgical resection. Two patients were treated to palliate post-resection recurrence. Initial radiographic response to RT included 2 complete responses (CR), 2 partial responses (PR), 4 stable disease, 3 progressive disease (PD). Two patients were classified as PD due to the development of distant metastases less than 2 months after completing RT. Two grade 3 toxicities were documented (one early, one late). At a median follow-up of 30.4 months, three patients had died with evidence of PD, two had died without evidence of PD, three were alive with metastases, and three were alive without evidence of disease progression (1 stable, 1 PR, 1 CR). From the start of RT, median overall survival was 32.1 months; progression free survival was 14.6 months. Conclusion(s): RT may have the potential to convert PNTs from locally-advanced to resectable. RT may also increase local control of PNTs. Consideration should be given to the use of RT in prospective trials of PNT treatment.",Excluded
588,"Treatment of multifocal intracranial progression of adenocarinoma of the lung with high-dose pulsed erlotinib complicated by hemorrhage and generalized cerebral edema. Background: The development of isolated intracranial metastases is increasingly recognized as a relevant clinical problem in patients who respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Single case reports of successful and well-tolerated treatment with high-dose, pulsed erlotinib have been published. (Hata et al, JTO 2011; Dhruva and Socinski, JCO 2009) Methods: We analyze the course of patient who developed intracranial hemorrhage and generalized cerebral edema during treatment with high-dose erlotinib. Result(s): A 44 year old Caucasian female neversmoker presented in 12/08 with left arm weakness. Computed tomography (CT) revealed several brain lesions, and a mass in the right lung. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed metastases in the liver and right kidney. Following bronchoscopic biopsy, adenocarcinoma of the lung, clinical stage IV, was diagnosed. Whole brain irradiation (35 Gy) and three cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 75mg/ m2 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks) led to a partial response; however, during the fifth cycle a clear progression occurred. A pulmonary embolus was treated with tinzaparin (10,000 I.U. sc od). Genetic analyses showed an activating mutation in EGFR exon 19, and treatment with erlotinib was initiated. This led to regression of all tumor sites, including the kidney. After 13 months of erlotinib, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed progression of the cerebral metastases. The primary tumor and intraabdominal metastases were stable, and so the intracerebral metastases were stereotactiacally irradiated. Three months later one further metastasis was irradiated, however multifocal intracranial progression soon developed. A neurosurgical biopsy showed the same mutation as in the primary tumor, with no known resistance mutations. High dose pulsed erlotinib was added (600 mg q 4d). After 2 weeks hemorrhage into three of the metastases (before hemorrhage: 35x27mm, 11x19mm, 9x8mm) occurred. Anticoagulants were stopped, and due to 6mm midline shift the largest hematoma (35 x 23 mm) was evacuated. MRI showed a trend to partial response in the other intracerebral metastases and so the erlotinib pulses were continued with a 25% dose reduction. Unfortunately, 24 days later, cerebral edema and subdural hygroma developed and the patient died, 24 months after initial diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Brain metastases despite systemic control increasingly pose a problem (Lee et al., Cancer, 2010). Inadequate dosing across the blood brain barrier is one explanation, but has not been proven. The absence of resistance mutations, as well as the multifocal nature of the intracerebral progression, support this theory in our case. The efficacy of high dose erlotinib for brain metastases has been previously reported. Previous reports describe minimal toxicity during treatment. The significant multi-focal hemorrhage and cerebral edema which developed in our patient have not been previously described in this setting. Simultaneous anticoagulation as well as previous stereotactic radiation of the brain metastases may have predisposed our patient to hemorrhage, and may prove to be relative contraindications to high-dose pulsed erlotinib. Because most centers only see a few patients in this clinical situation, cooperative efforts are needed to collect and analyze these cases, and to develop appropriate treatment strategies.",Excluded
3421,"Control of brain metastases from radioresistant tumors treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma are considered to be ""radioresistant"" tumor histologies. Brain metastases (BM) from these tumors are considered unlikely to be controlled using the relatively low doses used in whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control and overall survival of BM from radioresistant primary tumors. We reviewed all patients who received Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) for BM at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2009 and April 2014. All patients were treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion System. Dosimetric data was collected from treatment plans and metastases were categorized as radioresistant or not. Response was assessed by reviewing follow-up brain imaging studies and classified according to RECIST. Local control and median overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, 373 tumors were analyzed from 126 patients. Of these tumors, 49 (13.1 %) originated from radioresistant cancers. The overall local control rate in the radioresistant cohort was 89.8 and 90.1 % in the non-radioresistant cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance status of the primary tumor had no statistically significant effect on local control with hazard ratios of 1.0 (p = 1.0, 95 % CI 0.388-2.576) and 0.954 (p = 0.926, 95 % CI 0.349-2.603) respectively. Median overall survival for both radioresistant and non-radioresistant cohorts was 20.0 months, with a p value of 0.926. There was no significant difference in local control of BM from radioresistant and non-radioresistant primary tumors treated with GKRS. Both cohorts showed excellent response and local control, suggesting that SRS upfront or in addition to WBRT may be an appropriate strategy in the treatment of BM from radioresistant cancers. Median overall survival for both cohorts was equal, suggesting that improved local control may be associated with an improvement in long-term survival.",Excluded
3340,"Role of nanomedicine in treatment of brain cancer. Background: Drug delivery to cancerous brain is a challenging task as it is surrounded by an efficient protective barrier. The main hurdles for delivery of bioactive molecules to cancerous brain are blood brain barrier (BBB), the invasive nature of gliomas, drug resistance, and difficult brain interstitium transportation. Therefore, treatment of brain cancer with the available drug regimen is difficult and has shown little improvement in recent years. Method(s): We searched about recent advancements in the use of nanomedicine for effective treatment of the brain cancer. We focused on the use of liposomes, nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers to improve brain cancer therapy. Result(s): Nanomedicines are well suited for the treatment of brain cancer owing to their highly acceptable biological, chemical, and physical properties. Smaller size of nanomedicines also enhances their anticancer potential and penetration into blood brain barrier (BBB).

3271,"Quality assurance in IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy) at Kinki University. [Japanese]. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancers and brain tumors was started in December 2000 at our hospital. Methods of quality assurance (QA) in IMRT at our hospital are reported. IMRT was given by 4 MV X-ray with a dynamic multi-leaf collimator (MLC) method. Treatment planning was obtained by an inverse planning method. It took two days to select an appropriate treatment plan among various plans obtained by inverse planning, and three days to perform dosimetry in phantoms for each beam and the total beams and to determine an isocenter of fields. The measured dose distribution in phantoms were consistent with the calculated dose distribution, although the measured doses were 2-4% lower than the calculated doses. The accuracy of MLC is the most important point in QA of IMRT. Beam profiles were obtained for all beams by a semiconductor profiler before IMRT every day. In addition, position of MLC was checked by a test pattern of a film method once a week. This method is very accurate and the slight deviation of MLC position as small as 0.2 mm could be detected by the method.

Material(s) and Method(s): Whole-body PET imaging with a CTI/Siemens ECAT 953B scanner was done in a male and a female baboon. After i.v. injection of 444-1221 MBq of <sup>11</sup>C-NMB, sequential images taken from the head to the pelvis were collected for 3 h. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were identified that entirely encompassed small organs (whole brain, striatum, eyes, and myocardium). Large organs (liver, lungs, kidneys, lower large intestine, and urinary bladder) were sampled by drawing representative regions within the organ volume. Time-activity curves for each VOI were extracted from the PET, and organ residence times were calculated by analytical integration of a multi-exponential fit of the time-activity curves. Human radiation doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 and the standard human model. Result(s): Highest retention was observed in the blood and liver, each with total residence times of 1.5 min. The highest absorbed radiation doses were to the heart (10.5 mGy/kBq) and kidney (9.19 mGy/kBq), making these the critical organs for [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB.

3489,"Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance features of gynecologic abnormalities in women presenting with acute or chronic abdominal pain. Advances in technology and improved availability have led to increased use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate women presenting to the emergency department or to their primary care provider with abdominal and/or pelvic pain. Computed tomographic examinations are often performed to evaluate the presence of appendicitis or renal stone disease. However, gynecologic abnormalities are frequently identified on these examinations. Although ultrasound remains the primary modality by which complaints specific to the pelvis are evaluated, in many instances, CT and MRI imaging occurs before sonographic evaluation.Historically, because of cost, radiation exposure, and relative ease of use, ultrasound examinations have preceded all other imaging modalities when evaluating pelvic disorders. However, as CT and MRI technology have improved, their use in diagnosing causes of pelvic pain has become equal to that of ultrasound. In some cases, primarily because of historic comfort with sonographic evaluation, gynecologic abnormalities originally diagnosed on CT or MRI may be immediately and unnecessarily reevaluated by ultrasound. For a woman in her reproductive years, the most common adnexal masses are physiological cysts, endometriomas, and cystic teratomas. Although lesions are often asymptomatic and incidentally detected, they can present with pain, and they increase the risk of ovarian torsion. Common causes of chronic pelvic pain in this population include leiomyomata and adenomyosis. In postmenopausal women, ovarian carcinoma, which often does not present clinically until a late stage, has to be included in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. If a gynecologic pathology is discovered on CT or MRI, an immediate follow-up ultrasound need not be pursued if the lesion can be characterized as benign, needing immediate surgical intervention, or a variant of normal anatomy. If, on the other hand, findings demonstrate a mass that either is uncharacteristic of a benign lesion, has an indeterminate risk for malignancy, or demonstrates suspicious characteristics for malignancy (such as enhancing mural nodules), further evaluation by serial ultrasound, biochemical marker, and/or CT or MRI is warranted. The purpose of this review is to present a series of commonly encountered gynecologic abnormalities with either CT or MR to make radiologists more familiar with gynecologic pathology on CT and MRI.

The journey to Mars will be an ambitious, yet arduous task as it will entail culmination of all the information we have gathered over many decades. While the mission is of utmost importance, preservation of astronaut's well-being is paramount also. To that end, mitigation of radiation risk especially afflicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of great interest and challenge. Current data from astronauts on low earth orbit and Apollo missions provides insight on the risk of CVD from radiation exposure. However, data is limited given the small cohort size of astronauts who embarked on just nine prolonged missions. Therefore, a cerebral approach to understanding and mitigating risks are essential.

2733,"Acute effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field emitted by mobile phone on brain function. Due to its attributes, characteristics, and technological resources, the mobile phone (MP) has become one of the most commonly used communication devices. Historically, ample evidence has ruled out the substantial short-term impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) emitted by MP on human cognitive performance. However, more recent evidence suggests potential harmful effects associated with MP EMF exposure. The aim of this review is to readdress the question of whether the effect of MP EMF exposure on brain function should be reopened. We strengthen our argument focusing on recent neuroimaging and electroencephalography studies, in order to present a more specific analysis of effects of MP EMF exposure on neurocognitive function. Several studies indicate an increase in cortical excitability and/or efficiency with EMF exposure, which appears to be more prominent in fronto-temporal regions and has been associated with faster reaction time. Cortical excitability might also underpin disruption to sleep. However, several inconsistent findings exist, and conclusions regarding adverse effects of EMF exposure are currently limited. It also should be noted that the crucial scientific question of the effect of longer-term MP EMF exposure on brain function remains unanswered and essentially unaddressed.

Irradiated brain tumors commonly progress at the primary site, generating interest in focal dose escalation. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to use biological optimization objectives for a modeling exercise with simultaneously-integrated boost IMRT (SIB-IMRT) to generate a dose-escalated protocol with acceptable late radiation toxicity risk estimate and improve tumor control for brainstem tumors in dogs safely. We re-planned 20 dog brainstem tumor datasets with SIB-IMRT, prescribing 20 x 2.81 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 20 x 2.5 Gy to the planning target volume. During the optimization process, we used biologically equivalent generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUD) as planning aids. These were derived from human data, calculated to adhere to normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) <=5%, and converted to the herein used fractionation schedule. We extracted the absolute organ at risk dose-volume histograms to calculate NTCP of each individual plan. For planning optimization, gEUD<sub>(a = 4) </sub> = 39.8 Gy for brain and gEUD<sub>(a = 6.3) </sub> = 43.8 Gy for brainstem were applied. Mean brain NTCP was low with 0.43% (SD +/-0.49%, range 0.01-2.04%); mean brainstem NTCP was higher with 7.18% (SD +/-4.29%, range 2.87-20.72%). Nevertheless, NTCP of < 10% in brainstem was achievable in 80% (16/20) of dogs. Spearman's correlation between relative GTV and NTCP was high (rho = 0.798, P < .001), emphasizing increased risk with relative size even with subvolume-boost. Including biologically based gEUD values into optimization allowed estimating NTCP during the planning process. In conclusion, gEUD-based SIB-IMRT planning resulted in dose-escalated treatment plans with acceptable risk estimate of NTCP < 10% in the majority of dogs with brainstem tumors.

Of the five patients with neurological deficits, none had a persistent deficit. In two cases the neurological deficits were due to an increase in edema. Whether this occurred as a result of the gamma knife treatment or was the natural progression of the tumor is unclear.CONCLUSIONS: Complications after GKR are uncommon and the risk of a permanent deficit arising from an acute neurological event is exceedingly low.",Excluded

2329,"Characterization of structurally distinct, isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors in combination with radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma. The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in fundamental cellular functions important in normal cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation.",Excluded
1874,"Total-body PET: Maximizing sensitivity to create new opportunities for clinical research and patient care. PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.

1505,"Asynchronous inputs and NMDA conductances predict excitatory responses in the cortical-cA1 pathway of the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, CA1 place cells are driven by a substantial input from CA3. There is a second pathway to CA1 from the entorhinal cortex. The mode of action of cortex on CA1 through this pathway is not known. The pathway supports CA1 place field activity after CA3 has been lesioned, yet stimulation of the pathway in rat slices results in strong feedforward inhibition that prevents pyramidal cell action potentials. We use a detailed conductance-based model of this pathway to simulate the response to cortical stimulation in slice experiments and in vivo spatial exploration. We find that the presence of NMDA conductances enable CA1 pyramidal cells to integrate cortical inputs over a time scale longer than that which is effective in recruiting the inhibitory response that can suppress action potentials. We then show that this asynchronous response mode supports place field formation in response to experimentally constrained spatially modulated cortical activity. Within this model, the inclusion of GABAB conductances and the hyperpolarisation activated current I(h) reduces the strength of the GABAA inputs required to balance the excitatory inputs, and this facilitates place field formation by reducing variability in the inhibitory inputs.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to compare arc-based and mini-multileaf collimator (mMLC)-based radiosurgery treatment plans using isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms.METHODS: Of 11 patients who underwent conventional arc-based radiosurgery for intracranial malignancies, four were treated with one isocenter, four were treated with two isocenters and three were treated with three isocenters. The same cases were re-planned using a test version of mMLC-based radiosurgery software for multiple static non-coplanar fields.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For non-spherical targets, treatment planning is relatively intuitive with mMLC-based radiosurgery, reducing the amount of time required for planning. Moreover, a lower dose of radiation is delivered to normal tissue with mMLC-based radiosurgery than with arc-based radiosurgery, which theoretically should lead to a reduced risk of complications.",Excluded
449,"Incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing drugs. BACKGROUND: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs.METHODS: four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the adhesion and neurite outgrowth of nerve cells on a fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. We used fluorinated polyimide because of its biocompatibility and excellent thermal and mechanical properties for ion irradiation. Rattus norvegicus chromaffin (PC12) cells were used for in vitro studies. The polyimide films were irradiated with He(+), Ne(+), or Kr(+) ions in a fluence range from 10(13) to 10(15) ions/cm(2) at 50 keV. PC12 cells selectively adhered to the polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. The total neurite length for PC12 cells grown on the Kr(+)-irradiated film was the longest; the neurite length on the film irradiated by Kr(+) after 9 days was approximately five times longer than that for cells grown on the He(+)-irradiated film, i.e., 135 micro m. In addition, the PC12 differentiation rate on the ion-irradiated polyimide films also showed a similar trend to the total neurite length for PC12 cells cultured on the films: the rate decreased in the order Kr(+) > Ne(+) > He(+). This initial study indicated enhanced neurite outgrowth and differentiation of PC12 cells on fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation.",Excluded

Sib patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), XP90TO (42 years old, male) and XP92TO (40 years old, female, were assigned to group F by the complementation analysis in hybridized heterodikaryons. The XP90TO and XP92TO fibroblasts exhibited the typical XPF characteristics of a threefold higher sensitivity to the lethal effect of 254 nm UV and a reduced level of 12% unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) compared with normal cells. Clinically, both patients manifested moderate to severe acute sun sensitivity by age 8, pigmented freckles by age 10 and skin malignancies at higher ages (6 basaliomas at 42 years in XP90TO; 1 basalioma at 41 years in XP92TO). Despite the still currently sun-sensitive state, the patients showed normal minimal erythema dose (MED) at monochromatic wavelengths of 290, 300 and 305 nm but abnormally delayed peaking of erythema reaction at 48 h after exposure. After irradiation with more than 3 MED, XP92TO showed a long persistence of induced erythema for at least 7 days. A review of the 16 reported XPF patients indicated mild skin manifestations, no neurological abnormalities, and more delayed skin carcinogenesis at a lower frequency than that in XPA patients. In addition, we have collected clinical information from Japanese XP patients in rare complementation groups D and E and reviewed their clinical and photobiological characteristics.

BUB1 (Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), a mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase, has been linked in numerous cancers to pro-tumorigenic phenomena including elevation of cellular proliferation, tumor growth, metastatic potential, and poorer patient prognosis. However, the role of BUB1 in glioblastoma remains poorly investigated. In this study, clinical analyses determined significant enrichment of BUB1 in glioblastoma with direct correlation of elevated expression to poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Genetic inhibition of BUB1 in glioblastoma tumor cells via shRNA silencing diminished both proliferative ability and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of BUB1 was additionally determined to promote the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on glioblastoma tumor cells, and investigation of the underlying pathways revealed the roles of DNA mismatch repair, spliceosome and c-Myc pathways. Mechanistically, FOXM1 was determined to positively regulate transcription of BUB1 via direct promoter region binding. For validation, pharmacologic inhibition through administration of a BUB1 inhibitor demonstrated attenuated glioblastoma cellular proliferation in vitro as well as delayed tumor growth with prolonged survival in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma in the form of BUB1, which plays a pivotal role in GBM proliferative and radio-resistance capacities in a FOXM1-dependant manner.",Excluded
2813,"The involvement of ATF4 and S-opsin in retinal photoreceptor cell damage induced by blue LED light. PURPOSE: Blue light is a high-energy emitting light with a short wavelength in the visible light spectrum. Blue light induces photoreceptor apoptosis and causes age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by blue light-emitting diode (LED) light exposure in murine photoreceptor cells.METHODS: The murine photoreceptor cell line was incubated and exposed to blue LED light (464 nm blue LED light, 450 lx, 3 to 24 h). The expression of the factors involved in the unfolded protein response pathway was examined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analysis. The aggregation of short-wavelength opsin (S-opsin) in the murine photoreceptor cells was observed with immunostaining. The effect of S-opsin knockdown on ATF4 expression in the murine photoreceptor cell line was also investigated.RESULTS: Exposure to blue LED light increased the bip, atf4, and grp94 mRNA levels, induced the expression of ATF4 protein, and increased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Exposure to blue LED light in combination with ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and dithiothreitol) induced the aggregation of S-opsin. S-opsin mRNA knockdown prevented the induction of ATF4 expression in response to exposure to blue LED light.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the aggregation of S-opsin induced by exposure to blue LED light causes ER stress, and ATF4 activation in particular.",Excluded

1873,"Mind over (white)matter: A relationship between client change talk and whitematter integrity?. Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method of applying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the assessment of whitemattermicrostructure. DTI is used tomeasure the directional coherence of water molecules (fractional anisotropy: FA) in white matter fiber bundles in the brain. High FA generally indicates greater axonal diameter, axonal density, & myelination. Fiber bundles including the arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, have been linked to language functions (Frederici & Giheran, in press). Given the theorized role of client language in motivational interviewing (Moyers et al., 2009), and the evidence for dierences in brain activity between types of client change language (Houck et al., in press), the goal of the present study was to examine the correlation between FA and measures of client language from MI treatment sessions for alcohol use. DTI was available from9 subjects (M age = 42.4, SD = 13.5 years). Although change talk counts are linked to treatment outcomes, in the present sample these counts were also correlated with age, which has a strong independent relationship with FA. Instead we evaluated a transition probability extracted from sequential coding of MI sessions: the log-transformed odds ratio for the transition between therapist open questions and client change talk (OQ2CT).With both age and OQ2CT in the model, we observed a trend in right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (p = .24) and anterior thalamic radiation (p = .196), as well as an eect in the left cerebellum (p = .05), each indicating a negative relationship between FA and the odds of responding to an open question with change talk. Work with alcohol dependent individuals shows decreased FA in superior cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Pfeferbaum et al., 2009). More recent research comparing current and remitted AUD suggests that these abnormalities are linked to recent drinking (Monnig et al., 2012). It is unlikely that within-session client speech has an immediate and direct eect upon whitematter integrity. Given the negative correlation in these data, amore plausible explanation is that participants with more severe drinking, and concomitantly greater damage to whitematter, aremore likely to describe negative consequences when asked about their drinking. Research with a larger sample and follow-up assessment is necessary before stronger conclusions can be drawn.",Excluded
2290,"Optogenetic disruption of sleep continuity impairs memory consolidation. Memory consolidation has been proposed as a function of sleep. However, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by several features including duration, intensity, and continuity. Sleep continuity is disrupted in different neurological and psychiatric conditions, many of which are accompanied by memory deficits. This finding has raised the question of whether the continuity of sleep is important for memory consolidation. However, current techniques used in sleep research cannot manipulate a single sleep feature while maintaining the others constant. Here, we introduce the use of optogenetics to investigate the role of sleep continuity in memory consolidation. We optogenetically targeted hypocretin/orexin neurons, which play a key role in arousal processes. We used optogenetics to activate these neurons at different intervals in behaving mice and were able to fragment sleep without affecting its overall amount or intensity. Fragmenting sleep after the learning phase of the novel object recognition (NOR) task significantly decreased the performance of mice on the subsequent day, but memory was unaffected if the average duration of sleep episodes was maintained at 62-73% of normal. These findings demonstrate the use of optogenetic activation of arousal-related nuclei as a way to systematically manipulate a specific feature of sleep. We conclude that regardless of the total amount of sleep or sleep intensity, a minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep is crucial for memory consolidation.",Excluded
3184,"Benefits of dual energy CT imaging for differentiating contrast staining versus haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients. Background: Due to the increase in Neurological Thrombectomy cases, we reviewed our 24 hour post procedural unenhanced CT head scan implemented to look for haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct. High attenuation signal can frequently be seen on unenhanced CT scan in these patients within the core infarct and is impossible to differentiate between iodine staining or haemorrhagic transformation. Evaluation of these images has always been subjective with no true diagnosis. Dual Energy CT is an established imaging modality in differentiation of iodine and haemorrhage in high density lesions, post clot retrieval or after contrast administration. Dual energy CT involves acquiring two simultaneous attenuation datasets at a high and low kV. The ratio of the difference in Hounsfield units in these two datasets gives us the ability to accurately differentiate different tissues. Utilising three material decomposition and iodine maps, virtual non-contrast images are created on the Syngo VIA workstation Case studies: A Siemens Dual Source CT scanner was utilised to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and/or haemorrhagic transformation in the case study patients that underwent clot retrieval. This is a robust method of differentiating between haemorrhage and/or iodine staining. Conclusion(s): The ability to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients in a single scan has numerous benefits.

1781,ATM induction insufficiency in a radiosensitive breast-cancer patient. The ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) gene (ATM) is a dominant breast cancer gene with tumour suppressor activity. ATM also regulates cellular sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) presumably through its role as a facilitator of DNA repair. In normal cells and tissues the ATM protein is rapidly induced by IR to threshold/maximum levels. The kinase function of the ATM protein is also rapidly activated in response to IR. The fact that women carriers of ATM mutations can have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and that many sporadic breast tumours have reduced levels of the ATM protein broadens the scope of ATM's tumour suppressor within the breast. This report describes the downregulation of ATM protein levels in a radiosensitive breast cancer patient. Postinduction ATM levels were up to tenfold lower in the patient's fresh tissues compared to normal controls. These results might indicate a much broader role for ATM anomalies in breast cancer aetiology.,Excluded

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is the single most effective therapy for malignant gliomas. Targeting the CD95 apoptotic pathway is a promising experimental approach to these neoplasms. Here, we asked whether irradiation modulates CD95-mediated apoptosis of human malignant glioma cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: LN-18, LN-229 and T98G human malignant glioma cell lines were irradiated with dosages from 0-8 Gy and treated with CD95L (CD95 ligand). CD95 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was determined by DEVD cleavage. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by crystal violet staining of cells in a 96-well plate assay. Clonogenic cell death was determined by a standard colony forming assay.RESULTS: We find that (i) CD95L-induced apoptosis, but not irradiation-induced clonogenic cell death, involves caspase 3 activation and is blocked by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A. (ii) Irradiation does not modulate CD95 expression either in p53 wild-type or in p53 mutant glioma cell lines, and does not enhance CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity or CD95L-induced clonogenic cell death.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous CD95/CD95L interactions are not involved in radiation-induced clonogenic cell death and that the killing cascades of CD95L and irradiation are independent in human malignant glioma cells.",Excluded

Method(s): In a single-institutional cohort, records of patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) more than 30 days from diagnosis of brain metastases were collected, and five PI scores were calculated for each patient. For each PI, three score-based groupings were made to examine survival differences by means of adjusted log-rank analysis and area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): Of 121 patients with sufficient PI information, 72 underwent SRS more than 30 days after diagnosis. Median age and Karnofsky performance status were 60 years and 80, respectively. Forty-three (60%) patients had lung primaries. Prior to SRS, 38 (52.8%) and 12 (16.7%) patients underwent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery, respectively. Two (2.8%) patients underwent both WBRT and surgery prior to SRS. A median of two lesions were treated per SRS course. Median survival of the cohort was 9.0 months. Using adjusted log-rank analysis for pairwise comparison, BSBM and GPA showed significance between two out of the three prognostic groups, while the other scores showed either one or no significant differences on comparison. AUC demonstrated good applicability for BSBM, RPA, and GPA, although SIR was statistically less prognostic than the other PIs. Conclusion(s): The PIs analyzed in this study were applicable in the setting of delayed SRS.

Objectives: PPTID (Pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation) is a middle property extremely rare tumor with middle character of pineocytoma and pineoblastoma. For this tumor, standard treatment is not established histologically for gradeII-III. (Case) 40 years old woman. It occurred for dizziness at transient diplopia, from 14 years ago and the Pt had pointed out the pineal tumor and hydrocephalus. For the next year, a neuroendoscopical third ventriclurostomy and tumor biopsy was done. (Dx:pineocytoma), and the GKS (20 Gy) was selected for postoperative residual tumor mass. The tumor size had reduced at one time, but midbrain hidden part-aqueduct of midbrain showed the recurrence of the mass lesion in the course of ten years. We performed complete removal as possible subsequently in our hospital because of progressive increasing of tumor.(Histopathology findings)the circular nucleated atypical cells which N/C ratio is high, and are relatively uniform multiply thickly. The tumor cells were synaptosphysin diffusely-positive, and mitotic images increased (mitotic index 6/10 HPFs) and there were few hot nodules of neurofilament and was findings of the gradeIII equivalency. (MIB-1 = 5.8%) (Clinical course)Based on GKS (20 Gy), the additional local site radiation was decided to be difficult. So observation follow-up was selected without chemo-radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The definition of the pathologic finding to distinguish gradeII-III of PPTID is vague, and the clinical course is various. So, the decision making for the time of the intervention of the surgical treatment and the selection of the chemo-radiotherapy (local radiation therapy, whole brain total spinal radiation) should be careful.",Excluded
2778,"Multimodal therapy for the treatment of fatigue in patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy and radiation. Background: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most frequently reported symptom associated with cancer and its treatment. Unfortunately, there are limited treatment options to alleviate this distressing symptom. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and methylphenidate (that is, multimodality therapy [MMT]) can play an important role in reducing CRF. The project's objective is to explore the effects and safety of this MMT on CRF in prostate cancer patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy. We hypothesizethat the MMT is capable of reducing CRF as measured by the FACIT-F subscale in prostate cancer patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy. Specific Aims:(1) Our primary aim is to obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of various treatments (exercise, CBT, and methylphenidate) and their combinations in reducing CRF in prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, as measured by the change in patients' FACIT-F subscale scores taken at baseline and on day 57 and the secondary objective is to determine the effects of the treatments and their combinations on anxiety and depressed mood (both measured by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS]); on physical activity and function (measured by an accelerometer and a handgrip dynamometer, respectively); on levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) in serum and induced monocytes, before and after treatment Methods: For this study, we will use a randomized factorial design to assess 3 treatments (exercise, CBT, and methylphenidate) and their placebos in 8 replications. A total of 32 patients will receive each primary treatment and 32 will not. Patients will be studied for a 57-day period, during which they are scheduled undergo daily radiation treatments with androgen deprivation therapy. Fatigue, anxiety and depressed mood, and inflammatory cytokines will be determined at baseline and at 3 subsequent post-intervention assessments. After successful initiation so far 19/64 patients were enrolled. Accrual continues.",Excluded
2603,"The physical basis of neuroimaging techniques. During the past 20 years, the technology of neuroimaging has improved on all fronts. Coupled with increased human ingenuity and the greater power of digital computers, modern imaging methods are capable of providing precise measurements of brain structure and sensitive assessments of brain function. The complementary nature of different techniques adds to their value, whereas the rivalry between modalities continues to catalyze the pace of technical advances. Although there may appear to be choices to be made as to which technique should be used for certain purposes, in many instances there are clear advantages and reasons to select a particular method. Some of these advantages were mentioned in this article, but here we summarize some of the relevant issues. Nuclear medicine techniques have almost no role in anatomic imaging because they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot hi general distinguish many types of tissues to permit structural analysis. Although CT provides excellent images of the skull, sulci, and ventricles, and is capable of providing volumetric and dynamic images with recent advances such as spiral scanning, it is unlikely in the future to challenge MR imaging for structural studies. CT exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and at acceptable doses cannot provide the soft-tissue differentiation needed for must structural studies. MR imaging systems based on magnets of moderate to high field strength provide images with contrast and spatial resolution superior to those of any other imaging method. In the foreseeable future, there appears to be no other imaging technique capable of providing the quality of anatomic information rendered by MR imaging. Furthermore, it is clear that continuing advances in MR imaging technology, such as the development of new magnets and improved RF coils, will lead to further improvements in image quality beyond that obtainable today, most likely at lower costs than previous systems. In addition, the development of higher field strength systems (operating at 3-5 T) will provide information at a spatial scale not previously available except in specialized animal imaging systems, so that in vivo resolution of 100 mum will be possible in many centers. One primary challenge will be to develop computer image analysis techniques capable of handling the wealth of anatomic detail provided by MR imaging in reasonable times and at reasonable cost. Functional methods will continue to evolve. Functional MR imaging is less than 4 years old but has already progressed to the point where it can provide data in some studies to rival the best available by other means. Questions regarding the superiority of functional MR imaging or PET, however, cannot be conclusively addressed now, and in fact may not be sensible; both will remain important for the next several years. There are realistic expectations that functional MR imaging will yield semi-quantitative measures of flow and oxygenation in individual subjects in a large number of cognitive and other tasks, and using functional MR imaging we should learn a great deal about the distribution and connectedness of neural systems involved with different functions. The major challenges will be in designing interpretable studies that lend themselves to the functional MR imaging format and in improving the reliability of the functional MR imaging data. Higher field magnets, providing images with higher SNR as well as being more sensitive to microscopic susceptibility effects, should increase the sensitivity of functional MR imaging. The ability to perform multiple repeated studies on individuals and its intrinsic safety, coupled with its high spatial resolution, assures it of an evolving role in the study of brain activation. PET will also continue to be used for many such activation studies. PET facilities uniquely can perform studies of organic disorders such as tumors, receptor systems, and metabolism. PET enjoys high sensitivity to activation and, in the right hands, can provide absolute quantification of flow changes as wel as resting flow, a task currently beyond functional MR imaging BOLD methods. Some improvements in spatial resolution and sensitivity can be expected from different detector systems.",Excluded
216,"Repeated delayed onset cerebellar radiation injuries after linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma. A 63-year-old woman presented with right hearing disturbance and vertigo. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed the presence of right vestibular schwannoma (VS). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was performed with a tumor marginal dose of 14 Gy using two isocenters. She was followed up clinically and neuroradiologically using three-dimensional spoiled gradient-echo MR imaging. She experienced temporal neurological deterioration due to peritumoral edema in her right cerebellar peduncle and pons for a few months beginning 1.5 years after SRS, when she experienced transient right facial dysesthesia and hearing deterioration. Ten years after SRS, the patient presented with sudden onset of vertigo, gait disturbance, diplopia, dysarthria, and nausea. MR imaging demonstrated a new lesion in the right cerebellar peduncle, which was diagnosed as radiation-induced stroke. The patient was followed up conservatively and her symptoms disappeared within a few months.Multiple delayed onset radiation injuries are possible sequelae of SRS for VS.",Excluded
705,"Trans S1 infralaminar scarring triangle a step-by-step guide. Introduction A unique triangular space has been identified by Teske et al., measuring 0.9-1.1 mL on each side.1 The boundaries are medial to the L5 nerve root, lateral to the S1 nerve root and the base of the triangle is above the disc of L5- S1. This space is large enough to accept the average loose disc fragment. This space tends to collect leaky disc material, a common result of trauma and surgery. Due to the curvature of the sacrum and the formation of dense scarring, regular epidural catheters and scopes have not been able to enter this scarred epidural area. Matsumoto et al., realized that entering from the posterior aspect of the S1 neural foramin with an 18 gauge RX-2TM Coude Needle and then rotating it, the curved tip allows for ventral epidural projection of a 21 gauge VERSA-KATH.2 The VERSAKATH is x-ray visible, and it is also steerable as long as rotation coincides with the advancement of the catheter. The scarring triangle is located in-between the L5 DRG and the S1 nerve root and above the L5-S1 disc. Dense scarring can present clinically as: ipsilateral back pain (due to the dura and posterior longitudinal ligament adhering together), L5 radiculopathy, numbness and dysesthesia in the lateral calf to the lateral ankle and foot, and weakness on dorsal flexion of the foot. In advanced cases, foot drop may be evident. Opening of the scarring triangle with the recommended volumes can reverse these clinical symptoms. An S2 component will present as radiculopathy along the posterior aspect of the thigh and calf. Stretch-induced ischemia of the involved nerve roots is likely the cause of foot drop and can be reversed following the scarring triangle neuroplasty.1Alignment of Neural Foramina Using C-ArmPlace patient in prone position. Fluoroscopically, with a true A/P view (A), the 4 sacral neural foramina will be seen as 8 foramina because of the curvature of the sacrum. The posterior neural foramina will be seen more cephalad while the anterior foramina will be seen more caudal. To align the neural foramina, rotate the c-arm in a cephalad direction until the S1 ventral and dorsal neural foramina line up (B). The 18 gauge needle has a curve near the tip, but one still needs a gentler angle to allow cephalad advancement of the catheter. The starting point will be the lateral side of the S2 posterior neural foramen.2 RX Coude Needle Entry Site and Placement The needle entry point is from the S2 aiming towards the medial side of S1. Apply topical anesthesia and advance the needle through the skin. 3 RX Coude Needle Advancement Curve the needle down to and contact bone between the S1 and S2 on the sacrum. After contact is made, continue to advance until a penetrative 'pop' is felt, indicating for aminal entry. 4 Introduction of Blunt Stylet Remove the original stylet and interlock the atraumatic, blunt stylet. With the aid of lateral fluoroscopic visualization, rotate the needle tip dorsally and medial. Position the c-arm with a cephalad tilt to reduce radiation exposure to the operator's hand, leaving only the needle tip visible.5 Catheter Placement Advance the styletted VERSA-KATH into the sacral canal under fluoroscopic visualization after removing the second stylet. The catheter needs to cross the L5-S1 disc space and advance into the fibrotic tissue (scar) near the top of the L5 neural foramen. The catheter should not advance medial or lateral inside the imaginary triangle between L5 and S1. For more accurate placement, the VERSA-KATH can be rotated during advancement.6 Inject 5-10 mL of OMNIPAQUETM 240, Followed by 150 Units of Hylenex Diluted in 10mL of Preservative Free Saline, Bolus of Steroid and Local Anesthetic1. Connect the Stingray Connector and inject 5-10 cc of OMNIPAQUETM 240 within the scarred area. Injection of contrast may require significant pressure for a complete spread due to its viscosity. It will open up the ventral epidural space, slowly crossing over, and spread from L4 down to S2 bilaterally. 2. Inject a mixture of 10 cc of preservative-free saline and 150 units of Hylenex; this will disperse the contrast. Carefully observe for a potential spread into the subdural and subarachnoid spaces, especially in failed surgery cases where the possibility of a dural tear may exist. 3. Slowly inject a mixture of 10 cc of 0.2% ropivacaine and 40 mg triamcinolone. Ask the patient to move their feet and to report any pain at any time other than during injection. Subdural injectate accumulation in the scarred area may produce bilateral pain and have atypical appearance. If subdural loculation occurs, it can be aspirated with an interlaminar needle placement. 4. After local anesthetic injection, observe the patient for 20-30 minutes and make sure they are able to perform a 90 degree straight leg raise without any evidence of motor block. 5. Infuse 10% NaCl over a 15-minute period. Then flush with local anesthetic or normal saline at completion. 6. If the patient develops a motor block, he or she may need to be admitted into the hospital for observation. 7. A one-time injection into the scarring triangle is effective for a short period of time; however, three repeat injections, 6-8 hours apart, have been reported as more effective for many months to over a year. 8. Instruct the patient to perform neural flossing exercises to the patient for the sciatic area. There are also separate instructions for the upper lumbar area. (Figure Presented) .",Excluded
2162,"Radionuclide antibody-conjugates, a targeted therapy towards cancer. Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an investigational procedure which utilises monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptide conjugates and/or other chemical compounds. These bio-vectors are able to transport a dose of alpha particles to destroy cancer cells. Radionuclide antibody-conjugates (RACs), labelled with beta emitters, have already been used in humans. More recently, TAT has been introduced to treat oncological diseases mainly leukaemia and lymphoma. Encouraging results have also been obtained in solid neoplasms with the administration of anti-tenascin. This chimeric antibody labelled with astatine-211 was delivered in patients with recurrent brain tumours into a surgically created cavity. Conversely, a clinical trial using a standard TAT approach to treat patients with metastatic melanoma, observed the shrinkage of the solid tumour mass. This response in melanoma may lead to an alternative mechanism for TAT, called tumour-antivascular- alpha-therapy (TAVAT), and forms the basis of a novel approach to the treatment of cancer disease states. In this paper, we will concentrate mainly on the application of TAT using antibodies. In particular, an investigation into the major general features connected with the use of alpha emitters in cancer therapy will be discussed. The prospective role of TAT with RACs will also be outlined briefly, especially focussing on the most important therapeutic strategies to date based on antibodies radiolabelled with beta emitters.",Excluded
1883,"Pelvic insufficiency fractures after irradiation: diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation.

Her medical history included osteoporosis and endometrial cancer that was treated with radiation therapy to the pelvis 1 year prior to presentation. Despite bed rest, analgesics, and therapeutic modalities, her pain remained intractable and prevented ambulation. Plain radiographs showed no fracture. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging showed fractures of the pelvis but were suggestive of malignancy. CT-guided bone biopsy was consistent with radiation osteonecrosis. After diagnosis and continued therapy, the patient progressed to ambulation with moderate discomfort. Failure to diagnose insufficiency fractures could lead to further pelvic irradiation, compromising already weakened bones and causing prolonged disability.",Excluded
984,"Impact of gallium-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT on management of neuroendocrine tumors. Methods Overall 40 patients (25 men and 15 women, age: 50+/-9 years) with clinical / biochemical suspicion or histologicaly proven Neuroendocrine tumors underwent <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT. 21 patients (52.5%) came with recently diagnosed primary NET. 17 patients (42.5%) presented with NET metastases from carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUPS). 2 patients presented with raised gastrin levels. Results Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT showed sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 92.5%, respectively, for primary tumor and 98.5% and 100% for metastases. It was better than a conventional imaging modality for the detection of both primary tumor (p < 0.001) and metastases (p < 0.0001). It changed the management strategy in 22 patients (55%). On the basis of the results, 11 patients (27.5%) underwent surgery for primary lesions for surgically resectable loco regional disease. Five patients (12.5 %) detected with advanced stage of disease on PET were spared unnecessary surgery. Six patients (15%) with poor 68Ga-DOTA-NOC uptake were spared unnecessary octreotide therapy and were started on systemic chemotherapy. In addition, the detection of the expression of somatostatin receptors led to octreotide-based treatments in 25 patients. Conclusions 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT provides incremental diagnostic information compared to conventional imaging. It has significant impact in management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Extent of disease defined by Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT can alter the surgical management of these patients. The detection of a high degree of somatostatin receptor expression can be exploited to treat patients with octreotide therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and, conversely, a negative finding on 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/ CT can guide the treating physician to choose an alternate form of treatment. Additional benefit of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT include patient convenience with short time acquisition and lower radiation exposure signifying the important role of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET CT in clinical practice of neuroendocrine malignancies.",Excluded

Purpose: The widespread use of <sup>68</sup>Ga for positron emission tomography (PET) relies on the development of radiopharmaceutical precursors that can be radiolabelled and dispensed in a simple, quick, and convenient manner. The DATA (6-amino-1,4-diazapine-triacetate) scaffold represents a novel hybrid chelator architecture possessing both cyclic and acyclic character that may allow for facile access to <sup>68</sup>Ga-labelled tracers in the clinic. We report the first bifunctional DATA chelator conjugated to [Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotide (TOC), a somatostatin subtype 2 receptor (SST<inf>2</inf>)-targeting vector for imaging and functional characterisation of SSTR<inf>2</inf> expressing tumours. Method(s): The radiopharmaceutical precursor, DATA-TOC, was synthesised as previously described and used to complex <sup>nat</sup>Ga(III) and <sup>68</sup>Ga(III). Competition binding assays of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC or [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC against [<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>25</sup>]LTT-SS28 were conducted in membranes of HEK293 cells transfected to stably express one of the hSST<inf>2,3,5</inf> receptor subtypes (HEK293-hSST<inf>2/3/5</inf> cells). First in vivo studies were performed in female NMRI-nude mice bearing SST<inf>2</inf>-positive mouse phaeochromocytoma mCherry (MPC-mCherry) tumours to compare the in vivo SST<inf>2</inf>-specific tumour-targeting of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and its overall pharmacokinetics versus the [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC reference. A direct comparison of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC with the well-established PET radiotracer [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC was additionally performed in a 46-year-old male patient with a well-differentiated NET (neuroendocrine tumour), representing the first in human administration of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC. Result(s): DATA-TOC was labelled with <sup>68</sup>Ga with a radiolabelling efficiency of > 95% in less than 10 min at ambient temperature. A molar activity up to 35 MBq/nmol was achieved. The hSST<inf>2</inf>-affinities of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC were found similar with only sub-nanomolar differences in the respective IC<inf>50</inf> values. In mice, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was able to visualise the tumour lesions, showing standardised uptake values (SUVs) similar to [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. Direct comparison of the two PET tracers in a NET patient revealed very similar tumour uptake for the two <sup>68</sup>Ga-radiotracers, but with a higher tumour-to-liver contrast for [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC.

635,"Persistent calcium current in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons. The suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the primary circadian clock, and suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons exhibit a diurnal modulation of spontaneous firing rate. The present study examined the voltage-gated persistent Ca(2+) current, in acutely isolated rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons using a ramp-type voltage-clamp protocol. Slow triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -85 mV to +5 mV elicited inward current (100-400 pA) that was completely blocked by Cd(2+). This current showed little or no hysteresis, and was identified as persistent Ca(2+) current. The threshold for persistent Ca(2+) current ranged between -60 and -45 mV, and it was maximal at about -8 mV. Nifedipine at 10-20 microM blocked 80-100%. To assess the role of persistent Ca(2+) current in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in both acutely isolated and intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons, the effect of Cd(2+) and nifedipine on firing rate was studied using on-cell recording. Application of Cd(2+) exerted a weak excitatory effect and nifedipine had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing rate of isolated suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. In all intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations (n=15), Cd(2+) slowly inhibited spontaneous firing; in high-frequency firing cells (four of 15), a transient increase of firing rate preceded inhibition. No significant effect of nifedipine on firing rate of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons was found. Therefore, persistent Ca(2+) current itself (as carrier of charge) does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous firing of suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. A slowly developing inhibitory effect of Cd(2+) on spontaneous firing of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations may be due to penetration of Cd(2+) through Ca(2+) channels, and its subsequent effect on intracellular mechanisms, while the transient increase of firing rate in high-frequency firing neurons is probably due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current.",Excluded

Background Intracranial meningeal hemangiopericytoma (HPC) represents a rare and aggressive intracranial neoplasm located along the dural sinuses. It constitutes less than 1 % of all intracranial tumors and approximately 2-4 % of all meningeal tumors. The authors present our institute's experience in combined modality management of 15 successive patients of HPC. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients of HPC treated in our institute from 2001 to 2011. Clinical characteristics and treatment modality, in the form of surgery and radiotherapy, were noted. Statistical analysis was done with regards to recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The median age of the patients was 40.0 years. Nine patients were males and six patients were females. The median duration of symptoms was six months. Headache was the most common presenting symptom followed by vomiting, motor weakness and seizures. Twelve patients underwent total excision while three had subtotal excision. Seven patients had WHO grade II histology tumors and eight patients had grade III histology. Thirteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Median RT dose delivered was 50 Gy. Five patients developed local recurrence. One patient had distant metastases. Median duration of RFS was 68 months. Conclusions HPCs are aggressive tumors. The mainstay of therapy is gross total resection at the initial surgery. Postoperative adjuvant RT should be offered to all patients, regardless of the degree of resection achieved.

2218,"Strong resetting of the mammalian clock by constant light followed by constant darkness. The mammalian molecular circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) regulates locomotor activity rhythms as well as clocks in peripheral tissues (Reppert and Weaver, 2002; Ko and Takahashi, 2006). Constant light (LL) can induce behavioral and physiological arrhythmicity by desynchronizing clock cells in the SCN (Ohta et al., 2005). We examined how the disordered clock cells resynchronize by probing the molecular clock and measuring behavior in mice transferred from LL to constant darkness (DD). The circadian locomotor activity rhythms disrupted in LL become robustly rhythmic again from the beginning of DD, and the starting phase of the rhythm in DD is specific, not random, suggesting that the desynchronized clock cells are quickly reset in an unconventional manner by the L/D transition. By measuring mPERIOD protein rhythms, we showed that the SCN and peripheral tissue clocks quickly become rhythmic again in phase with the behavioral rhythms. We propose that this resetting mechanism may be different from conventional phase shifting, which involves light induction of Period genes (Albrecht et al., 1997; Shearman et al., 1997; Shigeyoshi et al., 1997). Using our functional insights, we could shift the circadian phase of locomotor activity rhythms by 12 h using a 15 h LL treatment: essentially producing phase reversal by a single light pulse, a feat that has not been reported previously in wild-type mice and that has potential clinical utility.",Excluded
1522,"Transcription coupled repair deficiency results in increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic death in the UV61 cell line, the Chinese hamster homologue of Cockayne's syndrome B. Transcription coupled repair (TCR), a special sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), removes transcription blocking lesions rapidly from the transcribing strand of active genes. In this study, we have evaluated the importance of the TCR pathway in the induction of chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis in isogenic Chinese hamster cell lines, which differ in TCR efficiency. AA8 is the parental cell line, which is proficient in the genome overall repair of UV-C radiation induced 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP) and the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) from the transcribing strand of active genes. UV61 cells (hamster homologue of human Cockayne's syndrome (CS) group B cells) originally isolated from AA8, exhibit proficient repair of 6-4 PP but are deficient in CPD removal by the TCR pathway. Upon UV-C irradiation of cells in G1-phase, UV61 showed a dramatic increase in apoptotic response as compared to AA8 cells. Abolition of TCR by treatment with alpha-amanitin (an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II) in AA8 cells also resulted in an elevated apoptotic response like that observed in UV61 cells treated with UV alone. This suggests that the lack of TCR is largely responsible for increased apoptotic response in UV61 cells. Furthermore, the chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induced by UV were also found to be higher in UV61 cells than in TCR proficient AA8 cells. This study shows that the increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic death in UV61 cells is due to their inability to remove CPD from the transcribing strand of active genes and suggests a protective role for TCR in the prevention of both chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis and time-course appearance of apoptotic cells suggest that the conversion of UV-DNA damage into chromosomal aberrations precedes and determines the apoptotic process.",Excluded
2780,"Retrospective outcomes of right colon continent urinary diversion in a single center, improving the characterization of complication and reoperation risk. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Published studies of right colon pouch urinary diversion have variable outcomes with an estimated 1-50% risk of perioperative Clavien-Dindo 3+ complications and 1-69% risk of long term reoperation. This range is partly due to variability in outcome measurement and inclusion of differing patient characteristics and operative indications; it is unclear which factors are predisposing factors for complications and risk of reoperation in these studies leaving preoperative counseling difficult. We seek to characterize the impact that patient specific factors and operative indications have on risk of complications and reoperation for patients undergoing a right colon pouch as well as present the cumulative risk of reoperation over time. METHOD(S): Patients undergoing right colon pouch from January 2010 to April 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes of interest were rate of Clavien-Dindo complications in the perioperative period, readmission rate, and rate of reoperation. Patient specific factors association with Clavien Grade 3+ complications and reoperation were also analyzed. Operative indication for patients was stratified into: Cancer, Radiation Injury, Neurogenic, and Non-Neurogenic. A Kaplan Meier plot was used to characterize reoperation risk over time with death as a competing factor. RESULT(S): During the study period 60 patients underwent the procedure with an average follow up of 22 months. The rate of Clavien Grade 3+ complications and readmission rate in the 90 day post operative period was 25% and 43% respectively. The cumulative rate of reoperation was 52%. Overall no patient factors or operative indications were significantly associated with complications or reoperation. CONCLUSION(S): Overall the rate of complications, readmissions, and reoperation was high, but in agreement with other contemporary series. Right colon pouch is a difficult procedure on which to counsel patients due to the paucity of available data. The surgical outcomes and results at our center help further characterize the risks associated with this procedure, and the Kaplan Meier plot of reoperation risk can be used to illustrate that this procedure comes with significant risks over time.",Excluded
1385,"Quality of Life Following Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Versus Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy for Vertebral Metastases: Secondary Analysis of an Exploratory Phase II Randomized Trial. BACKGROUND/AIM: This was a prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized trial, which analyzed quality of life (QOL), fatigue, and emotional distress following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) versus conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) as part of palliative management of painful spinal metastases.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled in this single-institutional randomized exploratory phase II trial (NCT02358720). Participants were randomly assigned to receive SBRT (single-fraction 24 Gy) or 3DCRT (30 Gy/10 fractions). QOL (EORTC QLQ-BM22), fatigue (EORTC QLQ FA13), and emotional distress (QSC-R10) at the end of radiotherapy, along with 3- and 6-month follow-up were assessed.RESULTS: At all recorded time points, there were no significant QOL differences between cohorts, including painful sites, pain characteristics, functional impairment, or psychosocial aspects (p>0.05 for all). There were also no differences in all dimensions of fatigue between groups at each recorded time point (p>0.05 for all). Emotional distress was also similar at three (p=0.248) and six months (p=0.603).CONCLUSION: Although these results demonstrate that SBRT does not cause worse QOL deteriorations compared to 3DCRT, larger randomized investigations are recommended to corroborate these findings.",Excluded
3087,"Using the combined model of gamma test and neuro-fuzzy system for modeling and estimating lead bonds in reservoir sediments. Heavy metals attract a great deal of attention nowadays due to their potential accumulation in living creatures and transference in the food chain. Sediments of water reservoirs are considered to be a source of accumulation of these metals that develop in response to human activities and soil erosion. This study collected 180 samples of the surface sediments of water reservoir 1 at Chahnimeh in Sistan. Efficiency of the ANFIS model was evaluated to estimate the five bonds following the measurement of parameters in the laboratory. The following results were obtained for the parameters: organic carbon (OC) %, 0.31; cation exchange capacity (CEC), 37.07 Cmol kg; total Pb, 25.19 mg/kg; clay %, 45.87; and silt %, 39.02. These parameters were used as input for the training model. In the output layer, lead bonds were chosen as modeling targets in the following way: Pb f1 (4.61); Pb f2 (0.54); Pb f3 (16.28); Pb f4 (3.42); and Pb f5 (0.38) mg/kg. The best input compound in this model was chosen using the gamma test. From a total of 180, 88 data were considered for the model training section. Eventually, the neural-fuzzy model (subtractive clustering), developed for the prediction of lead bonds in the studied region, was able to account for over 99% of lead bonds in the sediments; considering statistical criteria of root mean squares error or RMSE (0.0337-0.0813) and determination coefficient or R<sup>2</sup> (0.92-0.99), this model showed good performance with regard to prediction.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features of delayed radiation-induced brain injury after radiotherapy for brain tumor.METHODS: The clinical, histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 9 cases with delayed radiation-induced injury were evaluated.RESULTS: The disease occurred from 6 months to 12 years after radiotherapy and often presented with headache and muscle weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging showed peripheral enhancing lesions with slight mass effect and surrounding edema. Microscopically, the major changes included coagulative necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels, vascular hyalinization with luminal stenosis and peripheral reactive gliosis. Immunostaining for hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha was positive in reactive astrocytes.CONCLUSIONS: Delayed radiation-induced brain injury is a relatively common complication of radiation therapy. The lesion was frequently misdiagnosed as brain tumor. Correct diagnosis relies on clinical, radiologic and pathologic correlation.",Excluded
1841,"Effects of low level laser therapy on proliferation and neurotrophic factor gene expression of human schwann cells in vitro. Previous studies have been proposed that proliferation and release of certain growth factors by different types of cells can be modulated by low level laser therapy. We aimed to demonstrate the effect of laser irradiation on human schwann cell proliferation and neurotrophic factor gene expression in vitro. Human schwann cells (SCs) were harvested from sural nerve that was obtained from organ donor followed by treatment with an 810 nm, 50 mW diode laser (two different energies: 1 J/cm(2) and 4 J/cm(2)) in three consecutive days. SC proliferation was measured, after first irradiation on days 1, 4 and 7 by the MTT assay. Real time PCR analysis was utilized on days 5 and 20 to evaluate the expression of key genes involved in nerve regeneration consist of NGF, BDNF and GDNF. Evaluation of cellular proliferation following one day after laser treatment revealed significant decrease in cell proliferation compared to control group. However on day 7, significant increase in proliferation was found in both the irradiated groups in comparison with the control group. No significant difference was found between the laser treated groups. Treatment of SCs with laser resulted in significant increase in NGF gene expression on day 20. Difference between two treated groups and control group was not significant for BDNF and GDNF gene expression. Our results demonstrate that low level laser therapy stimulate human schwann cell proliferation and NGF gene expression in vitro.",Excluded
1679,"Functional connectivity between secondary and primary motor areas underlying hand-foot coordination. Coincident hand and foot movements are more reliably performed in the same direction than in opposite directions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess motor cortex function, we examined the physiological basis of these movements across three novel experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that upper limb corticomotor excitability changed in a way that facilitated isodirectional movements of the hand and foot, during phasic and isometric muscle activation conditions. Experiment 2 demonstrated that motor cortex inhibition was modified with active, but not passive, foot movement in a manner that facilitated hand movement in the direction of foot movement. Together, these findings demonstrate that the coupling between motor representations within motor cortex is activity dependent. Because there are no known connections between hand and foot areas within primary motor cortex, experiment 3 used a dual-coil paired-pulse TMS protocol to examine functional connectivity between secondary and primary motor areas during active ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and supplementary motor area (SMA) conditioning, but not ventral premotor cortex (PMv) conditioning, produced distinct phases of task-dependent modulation of excitability of forearm representations within primary motor cortex (M1). Networks involving PMd-M1 facilitate isodirectional movements of hand and foot, whereas networks involving SMA-M1 facilitate corticomotor pathways nonspecifically, which may help to stabilize posture during interlimb coordination. These results may have implications for targeted neurorehabilitation after stroke.",Excluded
3334,"Environmental damage to the retina and preconditioning: contrasting effects of light and hyperoxic stress. PURPOSE: Environmental stress (bright light, hypoxia) can ""condition"" retinal photoreceptors, increasing their resistance to subsequent stress. The present study tests whether another photoreceptor-lethal stress, hyperoxia, can induce similar resistance.METHODS: Vulnerability to hyperoxia was tested in young adult C57BL/6J mice exposed to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week or to 50% O2 for 1 week and then to 75% O2 for 2 weeks. Vulnerability to light was tested in Balb/cJ mice exposed to 300 lux cyclic light for 2 days or to 75% O2 for 2 weeks and then to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week. Retinas were analyzed for photoreceptor death, levels of stress-related proteins (GFAP, FGF-2, MnSOD, acrolein), and the regulation of candidate neuroprotective genes (HSP70.1, Ledgf, FGF-13, Timp2).RESULTS: Light preconditioning did not cause measurable death of photoreceptors but reduced photoreceptor death induced by subsequent hyperoxic or light stress, reduced levels of stress-related proteins, and maintained the length and organization of photoreceptor outer segments. Hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable cell death but provided no protection against subsequent hyperoxic or light stress. Of the four candidate neuroprotective proteins examined, the regulation of only one (Timp2) seemed associated with the neuroprotection observed.CONCLUSIONS: Light preconditioning, causing only minimal damage to photoreceptors, induced protection against subsequent stress from both hyperoxia and light. By contrast, hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable photoreceptor damage but induced no protection against light or hyperoxia. These data suggest a separation between stress-induced damage to photoreceptors and the upregulation of protective mechanisms, encouraging the search for ways to protect the retina without damaging it.",Excluded

1317,"Selective 5-HT receptor inhibition of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic activity in the rat dorsal and median raphe. The dorsal (DR) and median (MR) raphe nuclei contain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) cell bodies that give rise to the majority of the ascending 5-HT projections to the forebrain. The DR and MR have differential roles in mediating stress, anxiety and depression. Glutamate and GABA activity sculpt putative 5-HT neuronal firing and 5-HT release in a seemingly differential manner in the MR and DR, yet isolated glutamate and GABA activity within the DR and MR has not been systematically characterized. Visualized whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to record excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC and IPSC) in 5-HT-containing neurons. There was a regional variation in action potential-dependent (spontaneous) and basal [miniature (m)] glutamate and GABAergic activity. mEPSC activity was greater than mIPSC activity in the DR, whereas in the MR the mIPSC activity was greater. These differences in EPSC and IPSC frequency indicate that glutamatergic and GABAergic input have distinct cytoarchitectures in the DR and MR. 5-HT(1B) receptor activation decreased mEPSC frequency in the DR and the MR, but selectively inhibited mIPSC activity only in the MR. This finding, in concert with its previously described function as an autoreceptor, suggests that 5-HT(1B) receptors influence the ascending 5-HT system through multiple mechanisms. The disparity in organization and integration of glutamatergic and GABAergic input to DR and MR neurons and their regulation by 5-HT(1B) receptors may contribute to the distinction in MR and DR regulation of forebrain regions and their differential function in the aetiology and pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disease states.",Excluded

1133,"Gamma Knife surgery for adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing pituitary adenomas after bilateral adrenalectomy. OBJECT: Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas may require a bilateral adrenalectomy to treat their Cushing's disease. Approximately one third of these patients, however, will experience progressive enlargement of the residual pituitary adenoma, develop hyperpigmentation, and have an elevated level of serum ACTH. These patients with Nelson's syndrome can be treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS).METHODS: The prospectively collected University of Virginia Gamma Knife database of patients with pituitary adenomas was reviewed to identify all individuals with Nelson's syndrome who were treated with GKS. Twenty-three patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow up were identified in the database. These patients were assessed for tumor control (that is, lack of tumor growth over time) with neuroimaging studies (median follow-up duration 22 months) and for biochemical normalization of their ACTH levels (median follow-up duration 50 months). Neuroimaging follow-up studies were available for 22 patients, and endocrine follow up was available for 15 patients in whom elevation of ACTH levels was documented prior to GKS. In the 22 patients in whom neuroimaging follow-up studies were available, 12 had a decrease in tumor size, eight had no tumor growth, and two had an increase in tumor volume. Ten of 15 patients with elevated ACTH levels prior to GKS showed a decrease in their ACTH levels at last follow up; three of these 10 patients achieved normal ACTH levels (< 50 pg/ml) and the other five patients with initially elevated values had an increase in ACTH levels. Ten patients were thoroughly evaluated for post-GKS pituitary function; four were found to have new pituitary hormone deficiency and six did not have hypopituitarism after GKS. One patient suffered a permanent third cranial nerve palsy and four patients are now deceased.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery may control the residual pituitary adenoma and decrease ACTH levels in patients with Nelson's syndrome. Delayed hypopituitarism or cranial nerve palsies can occur after GKS. Patients with Nelson's syndrome require continued multidisciplinary follow-up care. Given the difficulties associated with management of Nelson's syndrome, even the modest results of GKS may be helpful for a number of patients.",Excluded

We studied the effects of microwave irradiation during the incubation of free-floating brain sections with primary antibodies against gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), enkephalin and vasopressin. Vibratome sections of perfusion-fixed rat brain were incubated: (a) overnight at room temperature (20-22 degrees C), (b) during various periods of time under microwave irradiation, such that the induced temperatures did not exceed 10 degrees C, (c) same as (b) but with induced temperatures not exceeding 40 degrees C, (d) without microwave irradiation, at 4-10 degrees C (temperature control for (b)), (e) same as (d) but at 40 degrees C (temperature control for (c)). During the incubation-irradiation we continuously monitored the temperature and controlled it by cooling and by manipulating the energy output of the magnetron. The peroxidase immunocytochemical procedure was completed using for all sections the same incubation parameters. Selected GABA-immunoreacted sections were examined in the electron microscope. Incubation at 10 degrees C in the primary antiserum as short as 30 min, with or without microwave irradiation, already results in (weak) binding of the antibodies to immunoreactive structures. One or 2 h of incubation in the primary antiserum in the microwave oven at 40 degrees C or at the same temperature outside the microwave oven results in excellent staining of GABA-immunoreactive structures and of good staining of enkephalin- or vasopressin-immunoreactive structures. The ultrastructural details were much better preserved in incubated-irradiated sections than in sections incubated overnight and only slightly less preserved than in the other control sections. There is no improved penetration of the antibodies into the sections. We conclude that by using microwave technology or by raising the temperature of the incubation medium, the time of incubation, at least in these antisera, can be shortened drastically, whereas the ultrastructural details remain well preserved.",Excluded

2107,"Riluzole enhances ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity in human melanoma cells that ectopically express metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 in vitro and in vivo. PURPOSE: Brain metastases are a common preterminal event in patients with metastatic melanoma and require radiation therapy. Our group has previously shown that human GRM1 (hGRM1) expressing melanoma cells release excess extracellular glutamate and are growth inhibited by riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release. Riluzole-treated cells accumulate in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours, and then undergo apoptotic cell death. We evaluated whether riluzole enhanced radiosensitivity in melanoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate clonogenic survival after treatment in hGRM1 expressing and nonexpressing melanoma cells. Western immunoblots were performed to confirm apoptotic cell death. A xenograft mouse model was used to validate the in vitro experiments. Tumors harvested from the xenografts were fixed and stained for apoptosis and DNA damage markers.RESULTS: In the hGRM1-positive cell lines C8161 and UACC903, riluzole enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation; no difference was seen in the hGRM1-negative UACC930 cell line. C8161 cells treated with riluzole plus irradiation also showed the highest levels of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3; excised C8161 xenografts showed the greatest number of apoptotic cells by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001). On cell cycle analysis, a sequence-dependent enrichment in the G(2)/M phase was shown with the combination of riluzole and irradiation. Xenografts treated with riluzole and weekly radiation fractions showed significant growth inhibition and revealed markedly increased DNA damage.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown, in vitro and in vivo, that the combination of riluzole and ionizing radiation leads to greater cytotoxicity.

Purpose/Objective(s): To estimate planning margins based on interfractional setup error and intrafractional bladder motion during radiation therapy for bladder tumors by using the real-time tumor-tracking radiation therapy (RTRT) system with fiducial gold markers for the positioning. Materials/Methods: We analyzed 151 sessions in 19 patients with bladder tumors who had received radiation therapy with a localized boost using the RTRT system and fiducial markers for positioning from 1999 to 2011. Up to six gold markers were transurethrally implanted into the bladder wall around the tumor bed after the transurethral tumor reduction and 40-Gy pelvic irradiation. After the manual setup using skin marks, the coordinates of the center of gravity of fiducial markers were measured at the start of treatment and during irradiation. The table position was adjusted to the planned position if the discrepancy was larger than 2.0 mm along the cranial-caudal (CC), left-right (LR), or anterior-posterior (AP) direction. Using the position at the start of radiation dose delivery as the reference position, we analyzed the interfractional setup error and intrafractional error due to bladder motion. Result(s): The overall number of sessions in which table adjustments were required was 108 (71.5%) for pretreatment offsets and 38 (25.2%) for offsets after the initiation of radiation therapy. The number of table adjustments in a session ranged from 0 to 4, and more than two adjustments were required in 7 sessions involving 5 patients. To guarantee that 90% of patients in the population receive a minimum cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) dose of at least 95% of the prescribed dose, the setup margin (SM) was 14.5 mm, 9.6 mm, and 10.6 mm along the CC, LR, and AP directions, respectively. The internal margin (IM) calculated from offsets at the end of irradiation was 2.6 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.1 mm, and number of sessions in which the length of required table adjustment was greater than the calculated IM after the initial setup was 12 (7.9%), 14 (9.3%), and 17 (11.3%), and the average time interval (range, standard deviation) between the initiation of radiation therapy and the table adjustment greater than the calculated IM was 4.2 (0.2-15.0, 5.2) minutes, 5.6 (0.2-14.7, 5.0) minutes, 4.4 (0.2-14.7, 3.9) minutes along these directions, respectively. Conclusion(s): In contrast to a large SM based on skin marks, the positioning procedure of the RTRT system with fiducial markers is useful to reduce the planning target volume substantially. Considering that the incidence of table adjustment greater than the calculated IM was about 10% and that the interval time was highly variable, the table adjustment based on the on-line imaging has an advantage in detecting unexpected internal organ movement.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To measure scattered laser energy reaching the posterior pole during transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.METHODS: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was performed on 4 cadaver eyes with Nd:YAG noncontact, Nd:YAG contact, and diode contact lasers. Energy was measured with a photodiode through a 7-mm trephined hole in the posterior pole. Average percentage power, average power, and average energy transmission were calculated. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines were used to calculate allowable energy exposures for each laser.RESULTS: All 3 lasers transmitted 3% to 5% of the power to the posterior pole. The average energy transmission was 240 to 260 mJ for all lasers. The contact lasers had an average power transmission of 120 mW. The noncontact Nd:YAG laser, with shorter pulse duration, had an average power transmission of 13,000 mW, significantly greater than that of the other lasers. The ACGIH guidelines for allowable energy exposures were 93 mJ for the noncontact Nd:YAG laser, 1300 mJ for the contact Nd:YAG laser, and 440 mJ for the contact diode laser.CONCLUSIONS: Three percent to 5% of laser power delivered during cyclophotocoagulation reaches the posterior pole.

3292,"A review of the necessary planning target volume margins for patients receiving radiation to the brain, with the current immobilization devices in use at the hopital regional de sudbury regional hospital regional cancer program. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current margins of the planning target volumes in brain patients being treated at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program. The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined in the International Commission for Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) report 83 (2010) as the gross demonstrable extent and location of the tumour. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the volume of a tissue that contains the GTV and any microscopic tumour spread. The planning target volume (PTV) is defined by the ICRU 83 report (2010) as the margin accounting for both the internal and external uncertainties. With the use of image-guided radiation therapy such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), imaging and positioning has become much more accurate. A CBCT uses a 3D reconstructed volume of the patient's current position before treatment to verify and correct the setup. This is done by comparing it to the planning patient position as seen with the planning CT image and making any adjustments while the patient is on the bed (Pouliot, Bani-Hashemi, Chen, Svatos, Ghelmansarai, Mitschke, 2005). Daily imaging before treatment has allowed for positioning of the patient accurately to match the image taken for planning purposes. This allows the patient to be set up within millimetres of the position they were in for planning. Currently at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program, daily imaging for patients receiving radiation to the brain is not standard practice, however, some patients are imaged daily by request from the physician. By using the shift data from patients who have received daily imaging, the setup uncertainty for every fraction can be determined and used to determine an appropriate PTV margin for the majority of patients, who are not imaged daily. If the PTV can be reduced for brain patients being treated, less of the normal brain tissue would be irradiated and could have the potential to reduce acute and late neurotoxicity of treatment (McDonald et al., 2011). A retrospective review of patients who have previously received radiation to the brain with daily CBCT imaging will be done to examine the shifts done before treatment to match the CBCT to the planning CT image. The patient population will include patients who received brain radiation and a daily CBCT before treatment since July 2010. The images taken daily before treatment will be retrospectively studied using the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program's electronic charting system (Mosaic). The shift data examined of patients who received daily imaging can be applied to a calculation proposed by van Herk (2004) to determine the PTV margin accounting for setup error. The shift data describes the measurements by which the patient was shifted after daily imaging to match the original planning image. This equation uses the shift data to determine the PTV margin for those patients who do not receive daily imaging. All patient data will be anonymous and will be kept on a locked password protected computer.",Excluded

We have examined whether near-infrared light (NIr) treatment mitigates oxidative stress and increased expression of hyperphosphorylated tau in a tau transgenic mouse strain (K3) that has a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The brains of wild-type (WT), untreated K3 and NIr-treated K3 mice, aged five months (thus after the onset of parkinsonian signs and neuropathology), were labelled immunohistochemically for the oxidative stress markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), hyperphosphorylated tau (using the AT8 antibody) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The average intensity and area of 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 immunoreactivity were measured using the MetaMorph software and TH+ cell number was estimated using stereology. Our results showed immunoreactivity for 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 within the SNc was increased in K3 mice compared to WT, and that this increase was mitigated by NIr. Results further showed that TH+ cell number was lower in K3 mice than in WT, and that this loss was mitigated by NIr. In summary, NIr treatment reduced the oxidative stress caused by the tau transgene in the SNc of K3 mice and saved SNc cells from degeneration. Our results, when taken together with those in other models, strengthen the notion that NIr treatment saves dopaminergic cells in the parkinsonian condition.",Excluded
104,"Evaluation of Peritumoral Edema in the Delineation of Radiotherapy Clinical Target Volumes for Glioblastoma. Purpose: To evaluate the spatial relationship between peritumoral edema and recurrence pattern in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight primary GBM patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy that did not intentionally include peritumoral edema within the clinical target volume between July 2000 and June 2001. All 48 patients have subsequently recurred, and their original treatment planning parameters were used for this study. New theoretical radiation treatment plans were created for the same 48 patients, based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) target delineation guidelines that specify inclusion of peritumoral edema. Target volume and recurrent tumor coverage, as well as percent volume of normal brain irradiated, were assessed for both methods of target delineation using dose-volume histograms. Result(s): A comparison between the location of recurrent tumor and peritumoral edema volumes from all 48 cases failed to show correlation by linear regression modeling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0007; p = 0.3). For patients with edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, the percent volume of brain irradiated to 46 Gy was significantly greater in treatment plans that intentionally included peritumoral edema compared with those that did not (38% vs. 31%; p = 0.003). The pattern of failure was identical between the two sets of plans (40 central, 3 in-field, 3 marginal, and 2 distant recurrence). Conclusion(s): Clinical target volume delineation based on a 2-cm margin rather than on peritumoral edema did not seem to alter the central pattern of failure for patients with GBM. For patients with peritumoral edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, using a constant 2-cm margin resulted in a smaller median percent volume of brain being irradiated to 30 Gy, 46 Gy, and 50 Gy compared with corresponding theoretical RTOG plans that deliberately included peritumoral edema. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to carry out a systematic study of spatial resolution and depth sensitivity for 2-D optical imaging methods with configurations typically encountered in functional brain imaging. We found the following: (i) the spatial resolution is <200 mum for NA<=0.2 or focal plane depth<=300 mum. (ii) More than 97% of the signal comes from the top 500 mum of the tissue. (iii) For activated columns with lateral size larger than spatial resolution, changing numerical aperature (NA) and focal plane depth does not affect depth sensitivity. (iv) For either smaller columns or large columns covered by surface vessels, increasing NA and/or focal plane depth may improve depth sensitivity at deeper layers. Our results provide valuable guidance for the optimization of optical imaging systems and data interpretation.",Excluded
1734,"Correlating radiographical and pathological response to immunotherapy in primary brain tumors. Objective: The radiographic response of primary brain tumors to immunotherapy is poorly understood. This study investigates the imaging and pathological characteristics of primary brain tumors after exposure to immunotherapy. Background(s): Immunotherapy amplifies the innate immune response to solid cancers. For example, inhibitors of immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 block signals to inhibitory T cells, thus increasing the T-cell mediated response to non-self antigens. In prior studies, a subset of systemic cancers treated with immunotherapy demonstrate radiographic worsening prior to pathological/clinical response to treatment. While this phenomenon of ""pseudo-progression"" has been described in primary brain tumors after temozolomide and radiation, the radiographic response to immunotherapy is poorly characterized. Design/Methods: Inclusion criteria are 1) primary brain cancer diagnosis, 2) second resection, and 3) use of immunotherapy prior to re-resection. ""Immunotherapy"" includes PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, or dendritic cell vaccines. Patients can utilize other chemotherapies and/or tumor treating fields, concurrently. Radiographical response on MRI is defined by RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro- Oncology) criteria. Pathological diagnosis is defined by WHO criteria. Result(s): At our center, 90 patients with primary brain cancers received immunotherapy during the course of cancer treatment. 10 of these patients (9 glioblastoma and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma) had re-resection after initiation of immunotherapy, with radiographical progression at 0.6-9.6 months, and repeat resection at 0.7-12.6 months. Of the 10 patients, resection pathology was characterized as predominantly treatment effect in 4 patients, and predominantly recurrent tumor in 6 patients. Further analysis will be done to characterize the molecular and genetic characteristics of resection tissue. Conclusion(s): Given promise in other cancer fields, immunotherapy is becoming increasingly popular in the treatment of primary brain cancer. In this limited case series, 4 out of 10 patients treated with immunotherapy had radiographic progression without significant pathologic progression. This suggests that immunotherapy may be continued past radiographic progression.",Excluded
2228,"Acute exposure to low-level light at night is sufficient to induce neurological changes and depressive-like behavior. The advent and wide-spread adoption of electric lighting over the past century has profoundly affected the circadian organization of physiology and behavior for many individuals in industrialized nations; electric lighting in homes, work environments, and public areas have extended daytime activities into the evening, thus, increasing night-time exposure to light. Although initially assumed to be innocuous, chronic exposure to light at night (LAN) is now associated with increased incidence of cancer, metabolic disorders, and affective problems in humans. However, little is known about potential acute effects of LAN. To determine whether acute exposure to low-level LAN alters brain function, adult male, and female mice were housed in either light days and dark nights (LD; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 0 lux) or light days and low level light at night (LAN; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 5 lux). Mice exposed to LAN on three consecutive nights increased depressive-like responses compared to mice housed in dark nights. In addition, female mice exposed to LAN increased central tendency in the open field. LAN was associated with reduced hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in both male and female mice, as well as increased VEGFR1 and interleukin-1beta mRNA expression in females, and reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in males. Further, LAN significantly altered circadian rhythms (activity and temperature) and circadian gene expression in female and male mice, respectively. Altogether, this study demonstrates that acute exposure to LAN alters brain physiology and can be detrimental to well-being in otherwise healthy individuals.",Excluded
1466,"Radiochemotherapy in the elderly with lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality with the median age of incidence being 69 years in males and 67 years in females. Radiochemotherapy (RT-CHT) is indicated in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and limited-stage small-cell lung cancer; however, a significant under-representation of the elderly has been observed in patient recruitment in cancer treatment trials. In the last decades of the 20th Century, studies showed that elderly patients achieved the best quality-adjusted survival with radiotherapy alone, but recent trials have found that fit elderly patients benefit from concurrent RT-CHT, although with more short-term toxicity. Age alone should not exclude fit patients and deprive them of the standard treatment. Using tools, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, a patient's tolerance to therapy can be assessed and monitoring can be performed. This review will focus on RT-CHT treatment in elderly patients with nonoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer and limited-stage small-cell lung cancer exclusively. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.",Excluded
2364,"Use of the dog spleen for studying effects of irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents, with suggested uses of other organs. The irradiation of the exteriorized spleen of the dog, with the animal lead-shielded, produced constant changes in the white blood cells. The time of recovery from the irradiation effect was determined. The normal canine spleen could handle live pneumococci injected into the splenic artery, as proven by sterile cultures of splenic vein samples. The size of the bolus used was determined by repeated trials and proved to be one billion pneumococci per pound of body weight. The capacity of the irradiated spleen to handle this number of pneumococci was impaired. It was found that whole body irradiation, nitrogen mustard, thio-tepa, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, and azothioprine all impaired this capacity of the spleen. The dose of the chemotherapeutic agent was the same in milligrams per kilogram as that used in the cancer clinic. A method for determining the recovery time following the use of one or more agents was developed with the repeated use of the spleen model. By extending the methods used with the spleen it was found that similar use could be made, usually without surgery, of the liver, gut, and lungs (and probably the kidney and brain).",Excluded

Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) frequently utilize healthcare services and undergo radiological studies to assess refractory headache symptoms despite cerebrospinal fluid diversion. To delineate the clinical utility of different imaging modalities and to estimate cumulative patient radiation exposure in shunted patients with IIH, we retrospectively reviewed 100 randomly selected patients with IIH and a prior cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure treated at our institution between July 2010 and August 2018. Patients had an average of 16.3 office (SD +/- 13.8), 12.4 emergency department (+/- 21.0), and 4.6 inpatient (+/- 5.1) encounters over an average 4.8 years of follow-up. Patients underwent an average of 9.0 head CTs (+/- 8.1), 10.3 shunt series x-rays (+/- 11.2), and 4.3 MRIs (+/- 3.7). Approximated radiation exposure per patient was 21.4 mSv (+/- 18.7). Radiological studies performed for acute symptoms usually demonstrated no actionable findings (82.5% CTs, 97.5% shunt series x-rays, and 79.6% MRIs). Shunted IIH patients undergo numerous radiological studies and are subject to considerable levels of radiation, yet imaging shows actionable findings in less than 10% percent of radiographic studies.

Background: In nuclear medicine, some recent studies have continuously reported that 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) amyloid PET obtained early after intravenous injection (eFBB) reflects blood perfusion and neuronal function to detect Alzheimeras Disease (AD). If eFBB can be used for AD diagnosis, it can help to reduce radiation exposure and increase patient convinnience by discriminating between amyloid nagative AD and positive NC and replacing 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Method(s): We retrospectively collected 264 cases of eFBB, which included amyloid positive NC (25.42%) and negative AD (16.82%). In order to obtain SUVr for analysis, eFBB and dFBB images of each case were spatially registered though CT template and eFBB template, and count normalization was applied to cerebellum, brainstem, and whole brain regions, respectively to identify the best pre-processing step. We evaluated the explanatory power and classification performance of the data according to the intervention of eFBB through logistic regression analysis (LRA) and stratified 4-fold cross validation. For visual observation of the image, we observed the intensity distribution of the image through the t-contrast embedded in the SPM. Result(s): As a result of LRA, the highest explanatory power and classification performance (Nagelkerke R2=0.648, Accuracy=89.4%) were observed when using eFBB template and whole brain region as a reference region. Regardless, when both eFBB and dFBB were known to the model, the explanatory power and classification performance were improved. In evaluating the generalization performance of the selected model, it was also shown that classification performance improved when eFBB was involved in general. When count normalization was performed with Brainstem, It showed the highest performance (84.545%). Conclusion(s): We could confirm the possibility that the early amyloid imaging can help discriminate AD from NC with only single modality of amyloid imaging imaged at early and late phase.",Excluded
856,"Patterns of care and outcomes after computed tomography scans for headache. BACKGROUND: concerns exist about potential overuse of computed tomography (CT) scans for headache in ambulatory care.METHODS: we sought to examine health services use, brain tumor diagnosis, and death during the year after CT scanning for headache by linking records of an audit of 3930 outpatient CT brain scans performed in 2005 in Ontario, Canada, to administrative databases.RESULTS: of 623 patients receiving CT scans for a sole indication of headache, few (2.1%) scans contained findings potentially causing their headache. For most patients, the index CT scan was the only one received over an 11-year period. However, 28.4% of patients received 1 or more CT brain scans during the preceding decade and 6.7% received 1 or more CT brain scans during the subsequent year. Of the 473 patients (75.9%) whose index scan was ordered by a primary care physician, most (80.3%) did not see a specialist during follow-up. One patient with an indeterminate finding on the index scan was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor (0.2%), and 6 patients (1.0%) died during follow-up. Among the 4 deaths in which the cause could be determined, none were due to central nervous system causes.CONCLUSION: because of the potential risk of cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation, efforts should be made to avoid CT scanning for headache when the likelihood of serious illness is low. Evidence-based decision rules that identify which patients with headache do not require neuroimaging may decrease the use of CT scans in situations of little benefit.",Excluded

1058,"[The stimulating impact of light on brain cognition function]. Light regulates multiple non-visual circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral functions, and conveys a strong stimulating signal for alert-ness and cognition. This review summarizes a series of neuroimaging studies investigating the brain mechanisms underlying the latter stimulating impact of light. Results of these studies are compatible with a scenario where light would first hit subcortical areas involved in arousal regulation before affecting cortical areas involved in the ongoing non-visual cognitive process, and then cognitive performance. Recent data demonstrated that the non-visual impact of light is most likely triggered via outputs from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which are maximally sensitive to blue light. In addition, the stimulating impact of light is intimately related to wakefulness regulation as it changes with circadian phase and sleep pressure. Finally, markers of inter-individual difference have also been described: age, PERIOD3 genotype, and psychiatric status. This review emphasizes the importance of light for human brain cognitive function and for cognition in general.",Excluded
74,"Dual-Phase Computed Tomography Angiography Enhances Detection of Contrast Extravasation in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage. Background: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) can be used to detect contrast extravasation in intracerebral hemorrhage. However, investigation for contrast extravasation in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is insufficient. We evaluated the efficacy of dual-phase CTA to improve evaluation of contrast extravasation in SAH. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with SAH who underwent contrast-enhanced dual-phase CTA within 24 hours from onset. The second-phase scan was performed 8 or 15 seconds following the usual CTA. The frequency of contrast extravasation was compared between phases. We also recorded the time from onset, coma level, interventional treatment, and early mortality. Result(s): Of 35 patients (22.9%) with SAH, 8 showed contrast extravasation in the second phase compared with 3 in the first phase. Contrast extravasation was correlated with clinical coma level (P < 0.05), and all contrast extravasation was found within 6 hours from onset. Early mortality, treatment decision, and hematoma distribution type did not correlate with existence of contrast extravasation. We also observed 4 cases of secondary subpial hematoma due to SAH, with 3 showing extravasation in both phases. Conclusion(s): Dual-phase CTA with a short interval enhances detection frequency of contrast extravasation in SAH and might be a better evaluation tool for SAH.

864,"Bevacizumab, temozolomide, and radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma: comprehensive safety results during and after first-line therapy. BACKGROUND: The proposed use of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma raised potential safety concerns. Bevacizumab has been linked with stroke, bleeding events, and wound-healing complications in other tumor types; these events are of particular concern for glioblastoma (highly vascular tumors that are usually resected). Published data on the interaction of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide are also limited. We report safety data from a phase III randomized trial (Avastin in Glioblastoma), focusing on these considerations.METHODS: Eligible patients received: radiotherapy and temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; a 4-week treatment break; temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; and bevacizumab/placebo until progression. Data on adverse events (AEs) were collected throughout.RESULTS: Bevacizumab-treated patients (n = 461) had a longer median safety follow-up time (12.3 vs 8.5 mo), and a higher proportion completed 6 cycles of maintenance temozolomide (64.6% vs 36.9%) versus placebo (n = 450). The incidences of relevant AEs (bevacizumab vs placebo, respectively) were: arterial thromboembolic events (5.9% vs 1.6%); cerebral hemorrhage (3.3% vs 2.0%); wound-healing complications (6.9% vs 4.7%); thrombocytopenia (34.1% vs 27.3%); radiotherapy-associated skin injury (8.2% vs 9.3%); alopecia (39.0% vs 36.0%); gastrointestinal perforation (including gastrointestinal abscesses and fistulae, 1.7% vs 0.4%); and radiotherapy-associated injury (0.4% vs 0.0%). Overall, 15.8% and 23.8% of bevacizumab- and placebo-treated patients had surgery (including biopsy) after progression. Within 30 days of postprogression surgery, AE incidence was 10.9% (bevacizumab) and 23.4% (placebo).CONCLUSION: The safety profile was consistent with that expected from radiotherapy/temozolomide plus bevacizumab. The increased AE incidence with bevacizumab did not impact patients' ability to receive standard-of-care treatment or to undergo further surgery.",Excluded
49,"12 mm lung nodule developed into metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in 2 years. Learning Objective #1: To recognize the malignant potential of lung nodules even in young patients Learning Objective #2: To review criteria for early intervention for lung nodules in lower risk populations CASE: A 30 year old man who presented appendicitis underwent abdominal CT scan and was incidentally found to have 12 mm irregularly bordered lung nodule. No prior chest imaging was available. Patient was discharged after appendectomy and was advised to have follow up imaging, but was thereafter lost to follow up. Two years later patient presented with productive cough and scant hemoptysis. A CTscan of the chest then revealed a 6.7 cm lung mass. Carcinoid tumor was suspected but octreotide scan was negative. A CT guided lung biopsy revealed adeno-carcinoma positive for EGFR mutation. Three weeks later patient was admitted with headache and right arm weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed left sided metastases in parietal and occipital lobe, confirming stage IV disease IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Risk of a lung nodule being malignant depends on size, consistency and patient risk factors. The risk of malignancy in a nodule of 5 mm is < 1 %, 5-9 mm is 2-6%, 8-20 mm is 18% and > 20 mm is 50%. Solid nodules are at greater risk than semi solid and ground glass nodules. Significant risk factors include cigarette smoking, age> 35 years, female gender, exposure to radiation or environmental toxins, pulmonary fibrosis, alcohol consumption and positive family history. According to Fleischner society guidelines a lung nodule > 8 mm should be either resected for biopsy in patients with risk factors for lung cancer, or followed up with CT chest in 3 months in low risk patients. In patients under 35 years old with no risk factors, the chance of a lung nodule proving to be malignant is < 3%. It has also been noted that patients with nodules between 8-30 mm and concern of poor follow up (due to socioeconomic status, psychological issues, young age) should undergo either non-surgical biopsy or video assisted thoracoscopic surgery with wedge resection. Lung adenocarcinoma commonly presents as a pulmonary nodule. 5 year survival rate of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma is < 10 % while for stage I it is 60-80%. The patient in this case presented 2 years after the finding of an incidental nodule with cancer that had progressed to stage IV. We suggest that timely intervention with biopsy of the nodule on first presentation could have altered this course. Conclusion(s): Guidelines should be used in the proper clinical context as a tool to help in patient management as exceptions always exist. In any patient, including young patients with no risk factors for lung cancer presenting with nodules > 8 mm in size, there should be significant clinical suspicion of malignancy. Follow up and tissue diagnosis are essential.",Excluded
3122,"Radial vs femoral approach: Does access point influence occupational radiation head dose to scrub nurses?. Background: There has been a notable trend towards using a radial approach during cardiac angiography in recent years. Studies show that irrespective of dose, cranial irradiation increases the risk of developing meningiomas by up to 10-fold [1,2], hence head dose monitoring should be a priority for departments. Objective(s): This study sought to determine whether head dose to operators and scrub nurses was affected by the choice of arterial access route. Method(s): A prospective study was performed over a period of 8 months monitoring the head dose to in-room personnel during both diagnostic and interventional coronary angiography cases. Data were collected using electronic detectors worn on the left temple by staff. The correlation between head dose to operating physician and the scrub nurse for both femoral and radial access points was evaluated. Result(s): The head dose to scrub nurses was significantly higher during radial cases compared with femoral access. (Table presented) Discussion: Whilst previous studies have shown that the dose for nurses is less than that of the operator for femoral access [3], limited data exists regarding head dose to nursing staff during radial cases. Further investigation is warranted to determine possible reasons for the increase in dose in radial access cases.",Excluded
1391,"Nuclear matrix associated DNA is preferentially repaired in normal human fibroblasts, exposed to a low dose of ultraviolet light but not in Cockayne's syndrome fibroblasts. In this study we addressed the questions as to whether repair is confined to the nuclear matrix compartment, analogous to replication and transcription and how repair events are distributed in DNA loops associated with the nuclear matrix. Pulse labelling of ultraviolet (254 nm) irradiated confluent human fibroblasts revealed that repair was preferentially located in nuclear matrix associated DNA in cells exposed to 5 J/m2. However, in cells exposed to 30 J/m2 repair approached a random distribution. The non-random distribution of repair label at 5 J/m2 was most pronounced directly after irradiation and gradually changed to a more random distribution within two hours after treatment. The results of pulse-chase experiments exclude the possibility of transient binding of repair sites to the matrix and favour the model of preferential repair of DNA sequences permanently associated with the nuclear matrix. Pronounced differences in distribution pattern of repair events in DNA loops were found among normal and UV-sensitive cell lines exposed to 5 J/m2. Repair in nuclear matrix associated DNA was 1.7 fold more efficient than in loop DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group D cells and over 3 fold in xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells. In Cockayne's syndrome fibroblasts repair in nuclear matrix DNA was found to be 2 fold less efficient than in loop DNA. This heterogeneity in distribution of repair correlates well with preferential removal of pyrimidine dimers from transcriptionally active DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells and its absence in Cockayne's syndrome cells as recently reported by Mayne et al., 1988. The results suggest that Cockayne's syndrome cells have a defect in excision of UV-damage from transcriptionally active genes located proximal to the nuclear matrix. Xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells may possess a defect in DNA repair associated with chromatin regions outside transcriptionally active DNA.",Excluded
2756,"The H reflex from the abductor brevis hallucis muscle in healthy subjects. In order to evaluate the clinical applicability of a neurophysiological technique, information is required about the effect of technical and subjective factors on the measured parameters, and whether these measures are reliable. The reliability of measurement of a given parameter is inversely related to the variability shown by a set of measurements of that parameter made on the same subject under similar conditions. Reliable measures are fundamental to the clinical utility of any technique. We evaluated the reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and assessed both single-point and test-retest normal limits for H-reflex parameters of abductor brevis hallucis (ABH). The H reflex from the ABH muscle was recorded in 36 of 43 subjects, but could not be elicited in 7 of 11 subjects who were >60 years of age.

2982,"Cochlear-implant high pulse rate and narrow electrode configuration impair transmission of temporal information to the auditory cortex. In the most commonly used cochlear prosthesis systems, temporal features of sound are signaled by amplitude modulation of constant-rate pulse trains. Several convincing arguments predict that speech reception should be optimized by use of pulse rates > or approximately 2,000 pulses per second (pps) and by use of intracochlear electrode configurations that produce restricted current spread (e.g., bipolar rather than monopolar configurations). Neither of those predictions has been borne out in consistent improvements in speech reception. Neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized guinea pigs phase lock to the envelope of sine-modulated electric pulse trains presented through a cochlear implant. The present study used that animal model to quantify the effects of carrier pulse rate, electrode configuration, current level, and modulator wave shape on transmission of temporal information from a cochlear implant to the auditory cortex. Modulation sensitivity was computed using a signal-detection analysis of cortical phase-locking vector strengths. Increasing carrier pulse rate in 1-octave steps from 254 to 4,069 pps resulted in systematic decreases in sensitivity. Comparison of sine- versus square-wave modulator waveforms demonstrated that some, but not all, of the loss of modulation sensitivity at high pulse rates was a result of the decreasing size of pulse-to-pulse current steps at the higher rates. Use of a narrow bipolar electrode configuration, compared with the monopolar configuration, produced a marked decrease in modulation sensitivity. Results from this animal model suggest explanations for the failure of high pulse rates and/or bipolar electrode configurations to produce hoped-for improvements in speech reception.",Excluded
1647,"Computed tomography versus intravenous urography in diagnosis of acute flank pain from urolithiasis: a randomized study comparing imaging costs and radiation dose. The equivalent sensitivity of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and intravenous urography (IVU) in the diagnosis of suspected ureteric colic has been established. Approximately 50% of patients with suspected ureteric colic do not have a nephro-urological cause for pain. Because many such patients require further imaging studies, NCCT may obviate the need for these studies and, in so doing, be more cost effective and involve less overall radiation exposure. The present study compares the total imaging cost and radiation dose of NCCT versus IVU in the diagnosis of acute flank pain. Two hundred and twenty-four patients (157 men; mean age 45 years; age range 19-79 years) with suspected renal colic were randomized either to NCCT or IVU. The number of additional diagnostic imaging studies, cost (IVU A$136; CTU A$173), radiation exposure and imaging times were compared. Of 119 (53%) patients with renal obstruction, 105 had no nephro-urological causes of pain. For 21 (20%) of these patients an alternative diagnosis was made at the initial imaging, 10 of which were significant. Of 118 IVU patients, 28 (24%) required 32 additional imaging tests to reach a diagnosis, whereas seven of 106 (6%) NCCT patients required seven additional imaging studies. The average total diagnostic imaging cost for the NCCT group was A$181.94 and A$175.46 for the IVU group (P < 0.43). Mean radiation dose to diagnosis was 5.00 mSv (NCCT) versus 3.50 mSv (IVU) (P < 0.001). Mean imaging time was 30 min (NCCT) versus 75 min (IVU) (P < 0.001). Diagnostic imaging costs were remarkably similar. Although NCCT involves a higher radiation dose than IVU, its advantages of faster diagnosis, the avoidance of additional diagnostic imaging tests and its ability to diagnose other causes makes it the study of choice for acute flank pain at Christchurch Hospital.",Excluded

A mechanical apparatus was used to measure in rats the effects of some unilateral basal ganglia lesions on the hind-limb rigidity produced by the cholinomimetic compound, tremorine. A globus pallidus lesion reduced the resting tone and greatly increased rigidity in the contralateral leg. Lesions in the entopeduncular, subthalamic, and accumbens nuclei had no effects on rigidity, although the entopeduncular nucleus lesion reduced resting limb tone. The role of the globus pallidus in rigidity is significant in relation to work in which striatal lesions abolished tremorine-induced rigidity. Some brain regions that receive basal ganglia efferent fibers received a lesion unilaterally. Lesions in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, or pedunculopontine nucleus had no effect on tremorine-induced rigidity. A habenular lesion significantly reduced rigidity in both hind legs. Very pronounced reductions in rigidity occurred after midbrain lesions involving the central periaqueductal grey region and the superior colliculus. The basal ganglia output pathways that may mediate tremorine rigidity are discussed, together with the possibility that the superior colliculus, which has many muscarinic receptors, may be influenced directly by tremorine.",Excluded

1119,"Low dose fractionated radiotherapy and temozolomiDe in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: Preliminary results of a pilot study. Purpose: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis, especially for patients with gross residual tumor after surgery (RPA classes V and VI). In vitro studies demonstrated the hyper-radiosensitivity of human malignant glioma cell lines to low radiation doses, moreover preclinical studies hypothesized a synergism between low doses fractionated radiotherapy (LD-FRT) and chemotherapy. Therefore we planned a pilot study to define the feasibility and the efficacy of this approach in na GBM RPA classes V-VI. Materials: Patients enrolled in the study had the following characteristics: histological diagnosis of GBM, based on minimal surgical resection or biopsy; age 18-80 years; RPA classes V-VI; estimated survival 3 months; normal haematological, renal, hepatic, cardiac and respiratory functions. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined as the surgical bed with gross residual contrast-enhancing tissue on magnetic resonance imaging. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was defined as the GTV with a 30 mm margin to incluDe any potential subclinical tumor. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as CTV + 5 mm, due to set-up uncertainties. Hypofractionated 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) was delivered on GTV (total dose: 30 Gy in fractions of 3 Gy/day) with concomitant and adjuvant (1 cycle) temozolomiDe (TMZ). From second to fifth cycle of adjuvant TMZ (200 mg/m2), if neither progression disease was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, nor unacceptable toxicities were recorded, LD-FRT was associated (2 daily fractions of 0.40 Gy, over 5 days, q 28). Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of toxicity and safety of this schedula (RTOG criteria). Clinical response (RECIST criteria), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. Result(s): From June 2008 to October 2010 15 patients with a newly diagnosis of GBM were enrolled in this study. Eight patients underwent incomplete surgical resection and 7 patients received only biopsy. The median total dose of LD-FRT delivered was 1040 cGy (range 320 1920). Up to this date 11 patients are evaluable. GraDe 12 haematological toxicity was observed in 18 % of patients, graDe 34 was observed in 9 % of patients, mainly represented by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; however no neurological acute and late toxicity were observed. No treatment related death occurred. Four patients (36%) had a partial response (PR), while 2 patients (18%) had a stable disease (SD), lasting more than 8 weeks (Clinical Benefit 54%). At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 2 22) median PFS was 5 months and median OS was 9 months, with a survival rate at 1 year of 30%. Conclusion(s): The results of the study demonstrated that LD-FRT with concurrent chemotherapy, after hypofractionated 3D-CRT plus Temozolomide, is a well tolerated treatment with a low toxicity profile. This data seem to be encouraging and suggest the prosecution of the analysis.",Excluded
581,"Sex-dependent differences in the activity and modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons. Women have greater temporal summation of experimental pain stimuli and also have a higher propensity for developing chronic visceral pain conditions. Sex hormone-mediated regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in nociceptive pathways is a plausible mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in modulation of NMDAR activity in adult male and female rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons were collected from adult male or female rats and grown in short-term culture in steroid-free media. NMDAR currents were recorded on small to medium size neurons by whole cell patch clamp using rapid perfusion with saturating concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid and glycine in the absence of extracellular Mg(2+). We found that the average density of NMDAR currents was 2.8-fold larger in DRG neurons from female rats compared with male rats (P<0.0001). Addition of 100 nM E2 increased NMDAR currents 55+/-15% in female neurons, but only 19+/-7% in male neurons. Potentiation was maximal after 20-40 min and dose dependent with an apparent 50% excitatory concentration of 17-23 nM. This effect was mimicked by E2 conjugated to BSA and attenuated by pretreatment with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A (1 microM) or the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182,780 (1 microM), strongly suggesting activation of a cell surface ER acting through a non-genomic mechanism involving protein tyrosine kinases to increase NMDAR currents. These results identify sex-based differences in both the basal expression and the regulation of the NMDARs in DRG neurons.",Excluded
3158,"A role for hydrolysis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in terminating the response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and to a flash of light in Limulus ventral photoreceptors. Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) into Limulus ventral photoreceptors produces excitation similar to that produced by light. One process which might contribute to rapid termination of the responses to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and to light is the hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by an InsP3-5-phosphatase to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. Inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 2,4,5-P3) is known to be less hydrolysable by the InsP3-5-phosphatase than is Ins 1,4,5-P3. Whereas ventral photoreceptors respond to an injection of Ins 1,4,5-P3 with a single wave of depolarization, the response to Ins 2,4,5-P3 is a burst of waves of depolarization. Our hypothesis is that it is the resistance to hydrolysis by the InsP3-5-phosphatase which accounts for the burst of waves produced by Ins 2,4,5-P3. To test this idea we injected ventral photoreceptors with Ins 1,4,5-P3 in the presence of the non-specific phosphatase inhibitors, vanadate and fluoride, which prolong the response to a flash of light in ventral photoreceptors (D.W. Corson, A. Fein, W.W. Walthall, J. Gen. Physiol. 82 (1983) 659-677). In the presence of fluoride or vanadate the response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 was composed of a burst of waves rather than a single wave of depolarization. We conclude that hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by the InsP3-5-phosphatase plays a role in terminating the ventral photoreceptors response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and also to light.",Excluded
3343,"Habituation of steady-state visual evoked potentials in response to high-frequency polychromatic foveal visual stimulation. In an attempt to develop safe and robust methods for monitoring migraineurs' brain states, we explores the feasibility of using white, red, green and blue LED lights flickering around their critical flicker fusion (CFF) frequencies as foveal visual stimuli for inducing steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and causing discernible habituation trends. After comparing the habituation indices, the multi-scale entropies and the time dependent intrinsic correlations of their SSVEP signals, we reached a tentative conclusion that sharp red and white light pulses flickering barely above their CFF frequencies can replace commonly used 13Hz stimuli to effectively cause SSVEP habituation among normal subjects. Empirical results showed that consecutive short bursts of light can produce more consistent responses than a single prolonged stimulation. Since these high frequency stimuli do not run the risk of triggering migraine or seizure attacks, further tests of these stimuli on migraine patients are warranted in order to verify their effectiveness.",Excluded

Accordingly, in this study, we used magnetic graphene oxide (NGO/SPIONs) nanoparticles coated with PLGA polymer as a dynamic nanocarrier for IUdR and, evaluated its sensitizing enhancement ratio in combination with a single dose X-ray at clinically megavoltage energies for treatment of C6 glioma rats. Nanoparticles were characterized using Zetasizer and TEM microscopy, and in vitro biocompatibility of nanoparticles was assessed with MTT assay. IUdR/MNPs were intravenously administered under a magnetic field (1.3 T) on day 13 after the implantation of C6 cells. After a day following the injection, rats exposed with radiation (8 Gy). ICP-OES analysis data indicated an effective magnetic targeting, leading to remarkably improved penetration through the BBB. In vivo release analysis with HPLC indicated sustained release of IUdR and, prolonged the lifespan in plasma (P <.01). In addition, our findings revealed a synergistic effect for IUdR/MNPs coupled with radiation, which significantly inhibited the tumor expansion (>100%), prolonged the survival time (>100%) and suppressed the anti-apoptotic response of glioma rats by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (2.13-fold) in compared with the radiation-only. In conclusion, besides high accumulation in targeted tumor sites, the newly developed IUdR/MNPs, also exhibited the ability of IUdR/MNPs to significantly enhance radiosensitizing effect, improve therapeutic efficacy and increase toxicity for glioma-bearing rats.

Purpose: To evaluate glass-based Yttrium 90 (Y90) radioembolization in management of neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Specifically to assess toxicities and short-term imaging response. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective review of all patients who had neuroendocrine metastases to the liver that underwent radioembolization with Y-90 was performed. Electronic patient charts were reviewed to analyze demographics, radiation dosimetry, clinical findings, laboratory data, and imaging findings. Toxicities and side effects reported during the first 3 months of the procedures were identified from clinical notes. Short-term imaging response was assessed using EASL and modified RECIST criteria by reviewing latest imaging study in comparison with pre-treatment studies. Result(s): A total of 48 patients received 88 radioembolizations between December 2009 and May 2011. 34 patients had adequate follow-up. A total of 60 lobar and segmental radioembolizations were performed in 34 patients. There were 18 males and 16 females with a median age of 61 y/o (43 to 80 y/o). The radiation dose ranged from 74.9 Gy to 347.1 Gy with an average of 150.9 Gy. 22 patients (65%) complained of fatigue. 15 (44%) right-sided abdominal pain and 8 (24%) noted weight loss ranging from 3.5 kg to 11kg.

65,"Computed-tomography-guided transforaminal intrathecal nusinersen injection in adults with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and severe spinal deformity. Feasibility, safety and radiation exposure considerations. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate our centre's experience on computed-tomography-guided (CT-guided), transforaminal, intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adult subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 and severe spinal deformity.METHOD: This is a retrospective, single-centre study investigating the feasibility and safety of CT-guided, transforaminal, lumbar puncture for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen (Spinranza R; Biogen; Cambridge, MA, USA) in a cohort of adult subjects with SMA type 2, severe neuromuscular scoliosis and previous spinal surgery. Between January 2019 and October 2019, five male, adult, SMA type 2 subjects were eligible to be treated in our centre with nusinersen. The mean age of the patients was 31 +/- 9 years (range 19-43 years). The study's outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and radiation exposure.RESULTS: In total, four patients completed the four loading doses, whilst the fifth patient received only one loading dose; two patients also received their first maintenance doses. Overall, 20 consecutive transforaminal, intrathecal treatments were analysed. Technical success was 100% (20/20 intrathecal infusions). No adverse events were documented following the procedures. Mean dose-length product (DLP) value per injection was 665.4 +/- 715.5 mGy*cm. Estimated mean effective dose per injection was 12.7 +/- 12.9 mSv. Subgroup analysis between the chronologically first 10 versus subsequent 10 procedures demonstrated a clear trend towards less radiation exposure in the latter, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (DLP: 984.7 +/- 903.3 vs. 436.7 +/- 321.5 mGy*cm, P = 0.165; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, CT-guided transforaminal access for intrathecal injection of nusinersen was proven feasible and safe. A decrease in radiation dose over time was noted. Protocols to minimize radiation exposure are essential.",Excluded

We investigated the plasma levels of tumor-specific cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in 17 stage I-II (early) and IV (advanced) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent radiotherapy. Digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and targeted sequencing showed that total and tumor-specific cfDNA levels increased in response to radiotherapy in both early- and advanced-stage NSCLC patients. We detected high copy numbers of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (L858R and T790M) in the cfDNA samples from stage IV NSCLC patients who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy to treat brain metastasis related to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment failure. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that radiotherapy increases tumoral cfDNA levels in the plasma and shows potential to serve as an indicator for diagnosing drug-resistant tumor-related gene mutations in early-stage NSCLC patients or those undergoing molecular targeted therapy.

1570,"3D Variation in delineation of head and neck organs at risk. Background: Consistent delineation of patient anatomy becomes increasingly important with the growing use of highly conformal and adaptive radiotherapy techniques. This study investigates the magnitude and 3D localization of interobserver variability of organs at risk (OARs) in the head and neck area with application of delineation guidelines, to establish measures to reduce current redundant variability in delineation practice. Method(s): Interobserver variability among five experienced radiation oncologists was studied in a set of 12 head and neck patient CT scans for the spinal cord, parotid and submandibular glands, thyroid cartilage, and glottic larynx. For all OARs, three endpoints were calculated: the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), the Concordance Index (CI) and a 3D measure of variation (3D SD). Result(s): All endpoints showed largest interobserver variability for the glottic larynx (ICC = 0.27, mean CI = 0.37 and 3D SD = 3.9 mm). Better agreement in delineations was observed for the other OARs (range, ICC = 0.32-0.83, mean CI = 0.64-0.71 and 3D SD = 0.9-2.6 mm). Cranial, caudal, and medial regions of the OARs showed largest variations. All endpoints provided support for improvement of delineation practice. Conclusion(s): Variation in delineation is traced to several regional causes. Measures to reduce this variation can be: (1) guideline development, (2) joint delineation review sessions and (3) application of multimodality imaging. Improvement of delineation practice is needed to standardize patient treatments.",Excluded
1684,"Recent advances in research on radiofrequency fields and health: 2001-2003. The widespread use of wireless telecommunications devices, particularly mobile phones, has resulted in increased human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields. Although national and international agencies have established safety guidelines for exposure to RF fields, concerns remain about the potential for adverse health outcomes to occur in relation to RF field exposure. The extensive literature on RF fields and health has been reviewed by a number of authorities, including the Royal Society of Canada (1999), the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and the Environment (CSTEE, 2001), the British Medical Association (2001), the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (Boice & McLaughlin, 2002), and the Health Council of the Netherlands (2002). This report provides an update on recent research results on the potential health risks of RF fields since the publication of the Royal Society of Canada report in 1999 (See Krewski et al., 2001a) and our previous 2001 update (Krewski et al., 2001b), covering the period 2001-2003. The present report examines new data on dosimetry and exposure assessment, biological effects such as enzyme induction, and toxicological effects, including genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and testicular and reproductive outcomes. Epidemiological studies of mobile phone users and occupationally exposed populations are examined, along with human and animal studies of neurological and behavioral effects. All of the authoritative reviews completed within the last 2 yr have concluded that there is no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with RF fields. However, following a recent review of nine epidemiological studies of mobile phones and cancer, Kundi et al. (2004) concluded that the possibility of an enhanced cancer risk cannot be excluded. These same reviews support the need for further research to clarify the possible associations between RF fields and adverse health outcomes that have appeared in some reports. The results of the ongoing World Health Organization (WHO) study of mobile phones will provide important new information in this regard. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded

Spike activity was studied in 95 neurons in the basal magnocellular nucleus in rabbits during spontaneous behavior and during performance of a conditioned operant response. Nearly half the neurons (48.4%) showed significant (p < 0.05) negative correlations between spontaneous discharges and the power of the frontal lobe EEG delta rhythm; most of these cells could be identified as cholinergic projection neurons. Neurons of this group had predominantly excitatory responses to the conditioned stimulus during performance of the operant task, while the responses to the conditioned stimulus of presumptively non-cholinergic neurons, not projecting to the cortex, were mainly inhibitory. The activatory responses of neurons in the basal magnocellular nucleus to the conditioned stimulus were markedly stronger while the animals performed the operant response as compared with performances in which there was no response to the conditioned stimulus. These results provide evidence that the basal magnocellular nucleus supports the level of waking and attending required for performance of operant conditioned reflex activity.",Excluded

Our paper examines space arts as a case study through the history, present practices, and future possible arts in the context of humans beyond the Karman boundary of the Earth's atmosphere. We develop a proposed taxonomy of space arts, based on prior taxonomies, and provide specific exemplars of space art developed by artists in space or for use by astronauts in space. Using examples of space art since the birth of the space age, we discuss (1) how human survival in extreme environments requires investment in the space arts, driven by consideration of various biopsychosocial factors and (2) how new scientific and engineering discoveries; such as the detection of air current patterns with paper airplanes in zero gravity, could be consequences or examples of creative thinking driven by artists in the various types of space art.

Introduction: Krabbe disease is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease due to decreased galactocerebrosidase activity. Adult onset is rare, however probably underdiagnosed. Brain MRI showing a leukodystrophy is of great value to achieve diagnosis. We aimed at performing for the first time a systematic analysis of brainMRI features in adult onset Krabbe disease (>10 years old). Method(s): We collected the first available brain MRI of patients seen in the reference center for lysosomal diseases. We also contacted authors of published articles describing adult onset Krabbe disease patients and ask them to share brain MRI data. A score was established to describe the brain MRIs, with quantification according to severity (from 0 to 4 for nonfascicular structures and from 0 to 2 for fascicular structures). Two neuroradiologists first scored separately the MRIs, then reached a consensus for final scoring. Result(s): Thirteen patients were included in the study. Pyramidal tract was the most frequent structure showing abnormal T2 hypersignal (100% of patients), however with some distinctions along the tractus: medial precentral gyrus (100% of patients, mean score 2.8/4), lateral precentral gyrus (77%, 1.77/4), and corona radiata (100%, 1.7/2) were highly abnormal whereas internal capsula (69%, 0.96/2), mesencephalon (46%, 0.69/2), pons (31%, 0.42/2), and spinal bulb (0%, 0/2) were quite spared. Other sus tentorial white matter (WM) localizations were also found abnormal: occipital WM (92%, 2.15/ 4), optic radiations (69%, mean score 1.03/2), frontalWM(69%, 1.5/4), temporal WM (61%, 1.15/4), and parietal WM (15%, 0.23/4). 9/13 patients (69%) had corpus callosum hypersignal especially in isthmus (69%, mean score 1.38/2), body (38%, 0.77/2), and splenium (31%, 0.61/2), whereas genu was always normal. Finally, medial lemniscus was the most frequent abnormal structure found in posterior fossa (9/13 patients, 69%, mean score 0.96/2).

Methods We analyzed 3,910 participants whose serum folate levels were within the normal reference range (1.5-16.9 ng/mL) at baseline evaluation in the population-based prospective cohort study named the ""Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and De-mentia."" The association between baseline folate quartile categories and baseline cognitive disorders [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia] was examined using binary logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding variables. The risks of incident MCI and dementia associated with the decline of serum folate level during a 4-year follow-up period were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results The lowest quartile group of serum folate (>=1.5, <=5.9 ng/mL) showed a higher risk of cognitive disorders than did the highest quartile group at baseline evaluation (odds ratio 1.314, p=0.012). Over the 4 years of follow-up, the risk of incident dementia was 2.364 times higher among subjects whose serum folate levels declined from the 2nd-4th quartile group to the 1st quartile than among those for whom it did not (p=0.031). Conclusion Normal-but-low serum folate levels were associated with the risk of cognitive disorders in the elderly population, and a decline to normal-but-low serum folate levels was associated with incident dementia.

Background: Despite CR rates of 70% with modern chemotherapeutic regimens, most pts with AML relapse. CNS relapses have become uncommon with the use of high-dose cytarabine based regimens. The features associated with a higher risk of CNS relapse are not defined. Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8. Therapy was successful in clearing all signs of CNS disease in 29 (41%). 19 of the 29 pts (65%) subsequently had additional CNS relapses after a median of 3 months.

Proteinacious intracellular aggregates in motor neurons are a key feature of both sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These inclusion bodies are often immunoreactive for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and are implicated in the pathology of ALS. On the basis of this and a similar clinical presentation of symptoms in the familial (fALS) and sporadic forms of ALS, we sought to investigate the possibility that there exists a common disease-related aggregation pathway for fALS-associated mutant SODs and wild type SOD1. We have previously shown that oxidation of fALS-associated mutant SODs produces aggregates that have the same morphological, structural, and tinctorial features as those found in SOD1 inclusion bodies in ALS. Here, we show that oxidative damage of wild type SOD at physiological concentrations ( approximately 40 microm) results in destabilization and aggregation in vitro. Oxidation of either mutant or wild type SOD1 causes the enzyme to dissociate to monomers prior to aggregation. Only small changes in secondary and tertiary structure are associated with monomer formation. These results indicate a common aggregation prone monomeric intermediate for wild type and fALS-associated mutant SODs and provides a link between sporadic and familial ALS.",Excluded

When comparing two models of orthotopic glioma (SF188/V+ glioma and 9L gliosarcoma) with a model of radiation necrosis in rats, we could clearly differentiate viable glioma (hyperintense) from radiation necrosis (hypointense to isointense) by APT MRI. When we irradiated rats with U87MG gliomas, the APT signals in the irradiated tumors had decreased substantially by 3 d and 6 d after radiation.

3221,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme: The First Experiences in the Czech Republic. [Slovak]. Background. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its treatment remains unsatisfactory with very limited overall survival. In the year 2001, in cooperation with Department of Neurosurgery, Nemocnice Na Homolce and Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, we have started to treat glioblastoma patients with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Methods and Results. Cells of malignant brain tumors, especially that of glioblastomas, are able to accumulate boron compounds. If BNCT should be successful, it is necessary to reach selective accumulation of sufficient amount of 10B in the tumor and low accumulation in the normal brain tissue. After BSH administration, radiation with low energy thermal neutrons is delivered. It results in nuclear capture and fission reactions with subsequent selective damage of tumor cells. At the time of analysis 9 patients have been enrolled. Therapy was completed in 5 patients. Treatment has been very well tolerated. We observed minimal acute toxicity associated with radiation and no laboratory abnormalities after administrations of BSH. Unfortunately treatment results were quite unsatisfactory. The median time to progression and overall survival were shorter then expected with conventional treatment. Conclusions. BNCT is very well tolerated with only a modest toxicity. In contrast to standard radiation, BNCT patients receive only one dose of radiation. Nevertheless, in this small pilot study first results were inferior when compared either to outcomes of conventional therapy or to results reported from other BNCT groups. It might be explained that lower dose of radiation had been used. Further study will show whether the higher dose radiation can improve treatment results.",Excluded
52,"Use of different outcome measures in randomised studies of malignant glioma can significantly alter the interpretation of time to progression: Reanalysis of the MRC BR2 study. The Medical Research Council (MRC) BR2 study [1] is a randomised trial of two doses of cranial radiation for patients with malignant glioma. We reanalysed data to examine the effect of using change in ranked scales of neurological status (MRC Neurological Status Scale) and performance (World Health Organisation Scale: WHO) to determine progression rather than clinician's impression. Four hundred and seventy four patients were studied. Where clinicians recorded no progression, ranked scales frequently documented progression (MRC 13%; WHO 13%). Where clinicians recorded progression, ranked scales frequently did not alter (MRC 33%; WHO 30%) or occasionally improved (MRC 5%; WHO 3%). When analysing time to progression based on a variety of measures, the estimated difference between treatments was most extreme (hazard ratio 0.81, logrank p = 0.04) when change in WHO status was used, and least extreme when change in MRC neurological status was used (hazard ratio 0.99, p = 0.94).

Purpose: The objective of this article is to evaluate the dosimetric efficacy of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in comparison to dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT) and 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for very small volume (<=1 cc) and small volume (<=3 cc) tumours for flattened (FF) and unflattened (FFF) 6 MV beams. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 21 patients who were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, using either VMAT, DCAT or 3DCRT, were included in this study. The volume categorisation was seven patients each in <1, 1-2 and 2-3 cc volume. The treatment was planned with 6 MV FF and FFF beams using three different techniques: VMAT/Rapid Arc (RA) (RA_FF and RA_FFF), dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCA_FF and DCA_FFF) and 3DCRT (Static_FF and Static_FFF). Plans were evaluated for target coverage (V100%), conformity index, homogeneity index, dose gradient for 50% dose fall-off, total MU and MU/dose ratio [intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) factor], normal brain receiving >12 Gy dose, dose to the organ at risk (OAR), beam ON time and dose received by 12 cc of the brain. Result(s): The average target coverage for all plans, all tumour volumes (TVs) and delivery techniques is 96.4 +/- 4.5 (range 95.7 +/- 6.1-97.5 +/- 2.9%). The conformity index averaged over all volume ranges <1, 2, 3 cc> varies between 0.55 +/- 0.08 and 0.68 +/- 0.04 with minimum and maximum being exhibited by DCA_FFF for 1 cc and Static_FFF/RA_FFF for 3 cc tumours, respectively. Mean IMRT factor averaged over all volume ranges for RA_FF, DCA_FF and Static_FF are 3.5 +/- 0.8, 2.0 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively; 50% dose fall-off gradient varies in the range of 0.33-0.42, 0.35-0.40 and 0.38-0.45 for 1, 2 and 3 cc tumours, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study establishes the equivalence between the FF and FFF beam models and different delivery techniques for stereotactic radiosurgery in small TVs in the range of <=1 to <=3 cc. Dose conformity, heterogeneity, dose fall-off characteristics and OAR doses show no or very little variation. FFF could offer only limited time advantage due to excess dose rate over an FF beam.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of palliative effect of hemibody irradiation (HBI) and response-related factors.METHODS: Analysis of prospective collected data of 78 procedures on 71 patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastases, treated with 6 Gy (upper half-body) or 8 Gy (lower half-body) HBI in single fraction. Clinical improvement was quantified by self-evaluation on a visual analogic scale (SVAS) before HBI, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours, at 7 days, and at each monthly control until patient's death. Univariate analysis included: sex, Karnofsky's index, tumor origin, histology, HBI dose, and SVAS before treatment. For statistical purposes the significance level was 0.05.RESULTS: Complete (37.5%) or partial responses were observed in 72/78 (92.3%) procedures, 80% appearing during the first 72 hours. Difference between mean SVAS, before and after treatment (7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 2.8 +/- 2.5), was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A mean response duration of 101 days over a mean overall survival of 141 days implies the 70% of expected patient's life span. Any analyzed prognostic factor does not correlate significantly with HBI response.CONCLUSIONS: HBI is a powerful palliative treatment in patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastasis.",Excluded

This study aimed to validate a novel method for fast regional superimposition of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. The method can be used with smaller field of view scans, thereby allowing for a lower radiation dose. This retrospective study used two dry skulls and secondary data from 15 patients who had more than one scan taken using the same machine. Two observers tested two types of regional voxel-based superimposition: maxillary and mandibular. The registration took 10-15 s. Three-dimensional surface models of the maxillas and mandibles were generated via standardized threshold segmentation, and the accuracy and reproducibility of the superimpositions were assessed using the iterative closest point technique to measure the root mean square (RMS) distance between the images. Five areas were measured and a RMS <= 0.25 was considered successful. Descriptive statistics and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to compare the intra-observer measurement reproducibility. The ICC was >=0.980 for all of the variables and the highest RMS found was 0.241. The inter-observer reproducibility was assessed case by case and was perfect (RMS 0) for 68% (23 out of 34) of the superimpositions done and not clinically significant (RMS <= 0.25) for the other 32%. The method is fast, accurate, and reproducible and is an alternative to cranial base superimposition. Copyright © 2015 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains incurable, and recurrent tumors rarely respond to standard-of-care radiation and chemo-therapies. Therefore, strategies that enhance the effects of these therapies should provide significant benefits to GBM patients. We have developed a nanoparticle delivery vehicle that can stably bind and protect nucleic acids for specific delivery into brain tumor cells. These nanoparticles can deliver therapeutic siRNAs to sensitize GBM cells to radiotherapy and improve GBM treatment via systemic administration. We show that nanoparticle-mediated knockdown of the DNA repair protein apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1) sensitizes GBM cells to radiotherapy and extend survival in a genetic mouse model of GBM. Specific knockdown of Ape1 activity by 30% in brain tumor tissue doubled the extended survival achieved with radiotherapy alone. Ape1 is a promising target for increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy, and nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA is a promising strategy for tumor specific knockdown of Ape1.",Excluded

The uptake of systemically administered rhodamine-ferritin complex by capillary endothelial cells (CECs) of the cerebral cortex was dependent on power density and on duration of exposure. At 5 mW/cm2, for example, a 15-min exposure had no effect. Near-complete blockade of uptake resulted when rats were treated before exposure to microwaves with a single dose of colchicine, which inhibits microtubular function.

3081,"Tumor resistance to radiotherapy is triggered by an ATM/TAK1-dependent-increased expression of the cellular prion protein. In solid cancers, high expression of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is associated with stemness, invasiveness, and resistance to chemotherapy, but the role of PrPC in tumor response to radiotherapy is unknown. Here, we show that, in neuroblastoma, breast, and colorectal cancer cell lines, PrPC expression is increased after ionizing radiation (IR) and that PrPC deficiency increases radiation sensitivity and decreases radiation-induced radioresistance in tumor cells. In neuroblastoma cells, IR activates ATM that triggers TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of JNK and subsequent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor that ultimately increases PRNP promoter transcriptional activity through an AP-1 binding site in the PRNP promoter. Importantly, we show that this ATM-TAK1-PrPC pathway mediated radioresistance is activated in all tumor cell lines studied and that pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 activity recapitulates the effects of PrPC deficiency. Altogether, these results unveil how tumor cells activate PRNP to acquire resistance to radiotherapy and might have implications for therapeutic targeting of solid tumors radioresistance.",Excluded
1690,"Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for multiple brain metastases. Introduction Due to the neurocognitive side effects of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is being used with increasing frequency. The use of SRS is expanding for patients with multiple (>4) brain metastases (BM). This study summarizes our institutional experience with single-fraction, linear-accelerator-based SRS for multiple BM. Methods and materials All patients who were treated between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, with single-fraction SRS for >=4 BM were included in this institutional review board-approved, retrospective, single-institution study. Patients were treated with linear accelerator-based image guided SRS. Results A total of 59 patients with >=4 BM were treated with single-fraction SRS. The median follow-up was 15.2 months, and the median overall survival for the entire cohort was 5.8 months. The median number of treated lesions per patient was 5 (range, 4-23). Per patient, the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc (range, 0.7-28.8 cc). The prescribed dose across all 380 BM for the 59 patients ranged from 7 to 20 Gy. The median of the mean dose to the total PTV was 19.5 Gy. Although the number of treated lesions (4-5 vs >=6) did not influence survival, better survival was noted for a total PTV <10 cc versus >=10 cc (7.1 vs 4.2 months, respectively; P =.0001). A mean dose of >=19 Gy to the entire PTV was also associated with increased survival (6.6 vs 5.0 months, respectively; P =.0172). Patients receiving a dose of >12 Gy to >=10 cc of normal brain had worse survival (5.1 vs 8.6 months, respectively; P =.0028). Conclusion In single-fraction SRS for patients with multiple BM, smaller total tumor volume, higher total dose, and lower volume of normal brain receiving >12 Gy were associated with increased survival. These data suggest that using SRS for the treatment of multiple BM is efficacious and that outcomes may be affected more by total tumor volume than by the number of lesions.

2451,"Treatment of near-skull brain tissue with a focused device using shear-mode conversion: a numerical study. Shear mode transmission through the skull has been previously proposed as a new trans-skull propagation technique for noninvasive therapeutic ultrasound (Clement 2004 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD). The differences of the degree of focusing observed among patients suggest that the intersection A(SW) intersection A(TX) can be used as a preliminary criterion for screening and calculation of the acoustic fields should confirm the degree of focusing patient by patient. In conclusion, shear waves provide a useful method for trans-cranial focusing in regions close to the skull surface.",Excluded
661,"Effect of low-power laser irradiation on impulse conduction in anesthetized rabbits. Low-power laser analgesic effect was generally accepted in clinical cases, whereas there was no direct evidence to indicate that low-power laser irradiation suppressed an impulse conduction within a peripheral nerve. The effect of low-power laser irradiation on electrically evoked responses within the sural nerve was electrophysiologically analyzed in anesthetized rabbits. High threshold evoked responses (conduction velocity was about 11 m/sec, unmyelinated A delta), which were induced by an electrical stimulation to the peripheral stump of the nerve, were significantly suppressed (9 to 19% inhibition) during low-power laser irradiation, which applied to the exposed sural nerve between the stimulus site and the recording site. The suppressive effect was reversible and recovered to the control level after the irradiation. Experimental evidence indicated that low-power laser irradiation suppressed the impulse conduction of unmyelinated A delta afferents in peripheral sensory nerve, which caused a pain sensation. Our data suggest that low-power laser acts as a reversible direct suppressor of neuronal activity.",Excluded

133,"Hyperthermia promotes c-myc turnover and reduces ODC expression in colorectal cancer cells. Hyperthermia therapy is an FDA-approved procedure that is used to improve the clinical response to radiation and chemotherapy in a variety of solid malignancies. This method involves raising the temperature of tumor-bearing tissues to 41-43degreeC, which is commonly achieved by using microwave or radiofrequency (RF)-emitting devices. Despite a multitude of treatment centers that are now providing this type of therapy, the cellular and molecular processes are not fully understood. Here, we report that that the oncogenic transcription factor, c-myc has a potentially important role in the anti-cancer mechanism of hyperthermia. By treating colorectal cancer cells (RKO cell line) with heat (incubation at 42degreeC), we observe a rapid decrease in c-myc levels that is not seen with other transcription factors. We have also observed a similar effect in other cell types, including lung (A549) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y). It is already known that the turnover of c-myc protein is enhanced by phosphorylation at Thr58. Our Western blot data reveal that hyperthermia causes a significant increase in Thr58 phosphorylation, which is accompanied by a reduction in total c-myc levels. c-Myc is frequently deregulated in human cancers, where it promotes the expression of genes that drive tumor cell proliferation. To assess the role of c-myc target genes in the response to hyperthermia, we looked at one such target gene, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis. We see that the hyperthermia-induced degradation of c-myc is accompanied by a drastic reduction in ODC mRNA and protein levels. Using actinomycin D, we observe that heat has no effect on ODC mRNA stability, suggesting that the decrease in ODC is due to a reduction in gene transcription. In support of this, we find that silencing c-myc expression with siRNA inhibits ODC mRNA and protein levels by a similar amount as hyperthermia. We propose that the down-regulation of ODC caused by c-myc degradation may be an important part of the clinical response to hyperthermia, and future work will evaluate the effect of heat on cellular polyamine levels.",Excluded
1958,"Impact of brain metastasis velocity on neurologic death for brain metastasis patients experiencing distant brain failure after initial stereotactic radiosurgery. PURPOSE: Patients with high rates of developing new brain metastases have an increased likelihood of dying of neurologic death. It is unclear, however, whether this risk is affected by treatment choice following failure of primary stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: From July 2000 to March 2017, 440 patients with brain metastasis were treated with SRS and progressed to have a distant brain failure (DBF). Eighty-seven patients were treated within the immunotherapy era. Brain metastasis velocity (BMV) was calculated for each patient. In general, the institutional philosophy for use of salvage SRS vs whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was to postpone the use of WBRT for as long as possible and to treat with salvage SRS when feasible. No further treatment was reserved for patients with poor life expectancy and who were not expected to benefit from salvage treatment.RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients were treated with repeat SRS, 91 patients were treated with salvage WBRT, and 64 patients received no salvage radiation therapy. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death after salvage SRS vs WBRT was 15% vs 23% for the low- (p = 0.06), 30% vs 37% for the intermediate- (p < 0.01), and 31% vs 48% (p < 0.01) for the high-BMV group. Salvage WBRT was associated with increased incidence of neurologic death on multivariate analysis (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.39, p = 0.01) when compared to repeat SRS. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death for patients treated within the immunotherapy era was 9%, 38%, and 38% for low-, intermediate-, and high-BMV groups, respectively (p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Intermediate and high risk BMV groups are predictive of neurologic death.

502,"Large cell neuro-endocrine carcinoma presenting as pancoast's syndrome. Pancoast's syndrome was first described in 1932 by Henry Pancoast as signs and symptoms of shoulder and arm pain, Horner's Syndrome, bone destruction and atrophy of hand muscles. While apical bronchial carcinoma commonly presents as Pancoast's syndrome, infection, benign tumors, and metastases should be considered. Thus, histopathological diagnosis is mandatory. Tumors of neural origin are rarely located at the thoracic inlet. We present a rare pathological tumor of Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC) presenting as typical Pancoast's Syndrome. A 70-year-old man with lifelong smoking history presented with progressive pain in his left shoulder and armpit for 6 months. His other complaints were blurry vision in the left eye, hoarse voice, weight loss and decreased appetite. Examination was significant for decreased breath sounds, left sided shoulder tenderness, ptosis, small pupil with enopthalmos, and atrophy of the hypothenar muscles and decreased sensation on the ulnar distribution of the hand and forearm with decreased motor strength and handgrip. Imaging studies revealed left apical lung mass and a mediastinal mass abutting the aortic arch with lymph node involvement. MRI of brain and spine showed involvement of subarachnoid space with left and right paravertebral masses. A biopsy of the mass revealed tumor cells positive for CK7, TTF-1, synaptophysin and chromogranin. It was negative for Napsin A, CD56, markers of squamous differentiation p63 and p40. This immunoprofile is compatible with Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma. The patient was started on radiation therapy and was scheduled for chemotherapy as an outpatient. Neuroendocrine tumors are rare and can occur anywhere in the body. Currently, LCNEC is classified a variant of large cell carcinomas; however, it is different from typical lung large-cell carcinoma in that these tumors display biological behaviors resembling those of small cell lung carcinoma and features of high-grade neuroendocrine tumors. LCNEC represent only 3% of all pulmonary malignancies. The current treatment approach, which has remained unchanged for the past 30 years, involves combination of platinum based chemotherapy and radiation, however outcome remains poor. No targeted therapy exists for these tumors because therapeutic biomarkers are incompletely known. Thus, advances in the treatment of LCNEC are needed to improve survival in patients with this class of tumors. The discovery of new, rational targeted therapies as well as preclinical models that will encompass this important subtype of lung cancer is necessary. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of Pancoast's syndrome caused by a LCNEC. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

Purpose: To examine long-term local control of vestibular schwannoma and side effects in patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) in British Columbia. Methods and Materials: From August 1998 to May 2009, 207 patients were treated with radiation therapy (RT) at British Columbia Cancer Agency. 136 (66%) received SRS, and 71 (34%) received SRT. Dose prescriptions were 50 Gy/25 fractions for SRT and 12 Gy/1 fraction for SRS. Our multidisciplinary provincial neuro-stereotactic conference recommended SRT for tumors >3 cm and for patients with serviceable hearing (Gardner-Robertson classes I and II). Result(s): Median follow-up was 7.7 years to the last MRI and 6.4 years to the last clinical assessment. Local control for SRS versus SRT was 94% versus 87% at 5 years and 90% versus 85% at 10 years (P=.2). Five- and 10-year actuarial rates of RT-induced trigeminal nerve dysfunction were 25% and 25% after SRS, compared with 7% and 12% after SRT (P=.01). Five- and 10-year actuarial rates of RT-induced facial nerve dysfunction were 15% and 15% after SRS, versus 13% and 15% after SRT (P=.93). In the 49 patients with serviceable hearing at baseline who were treated with SRT, hearing preservation was 55% at 3 years, 37% at 5 years, and 29% at 7 years. In multivariable analysis, better pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average was significantly associated with hearing preservation (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.07; P=.04). Conclusion(s): Both SRS and SRT provided excellent long-term local control of vestibular schwannoma. Stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with higher rates of trigeminal nerve dysfunction.

Purpose: To perform and assess the effectiveness of local excision of recurrent tumor followed by postoperative pulse dose rate (PDR) brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): From 1994 to 2000, 17 patients who had small recurrent breast carcinomas after initially undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT), which included postoperative radiation therapy, were treated with local tumor excision and PDR brachytherapy. Recurrences occurred at a median time of 50 months (range, 11-208 months) after primary treatment. Eight patients underwent a combination of PDR brachytherapy (total dose range, 12.5-28.0 Gy) and external-beam radiation therapy (EBT) (total dose range, 12-30 Gy). Nine patients underwent radiation therapy with 40.2-50.0-Gy PDR brachytherapy only. The prescribed radiation dose was 0.5-1.0 Gy per pulse. Patients were examined for local tumor control and treatment-related side effects. Result(s): Twelve of 17 patients had no local tumor at a median follow-up time of 59 months (range, 20-84 months); two of these patients showed signs of having distant disease. One patient died after a cerebral stroke without evidence of tumor. Four women treated with combined EBT and brachytherapy had secondary local tumor recurrences 4, 8, 8, and 11 months after therapy and had to undergo mastectomy. Despite having undergone radiation therapy previously, patients had side effects limited to moderate (grade 1-2) fibrosis. Conclusion(s): Local tumor excision combined with PDR brachytherapy for small local-regional tumor recurrences after primary BCT is feasible and well tolerated and might obviate mastectomy. Preliminary experiences are encouraging. Further studies are required for appropriate patient selection. © RSNA, 2002.",Excluded

The first 6 patients received IMA950 (9 major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class I and 2 MHC class II peptides) intradermally and poly-ICLC intramuscularly (i.m.). After protocol amendment, IMA950 and poly-ICLC were mixed and injected subcutaneously (n = 7) or i.m. (n = 6). Primary endpoints were safety and immunogenicity. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival at 6 and 9 months, and vaccine-specific peripheral cluster of differentiation (CD)4 and CD8 T-cell responses.RESULTS: The IMA950/poly-ICLC vaccine was safe and well tolerated. Four patients presented cerebral edema with rapid recovery. For the first 6 patients, vaccine-induced CD8 T-cell responses were restricted to a single peptide and CD4 responses were absent.

Photon or near-infrared light therapy (NILT) may be an effective neuroprotective method to reduce behavioral dysfunction following an acute ischemic stroke. We evaluated the effects of continuous wave (CW) or pulse wave (P) NILT administered transcranially either 6 or 12 h following embolization, on behavioral outcome. For the studies, we used the rabbit small clot embolic stroke model (RSCEM) using three different treatment regimens: 1) CW power density of 7.5 mW/cm(2); 2) P1 using a frequency of 300 mus pulse at 1 kHz or 3) P2 using a frequency of 2 ms pulse at 100 Hz. Behavioral analysis was conducted 48 h after embolization, allowing for the determination of the effective stroke dose (P(50)) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits. Using the RSCEM, a treatment is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P(50) compared with the control group. Quantal dose-response analysis showed that the control group P(50) value was 1.01+/-0.25 mg (n=31). NILT initiated 6 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.06+/-0.59 mg (n=29, P=0.099); (P1) 1.89+/-0.29 mg (n=25, P=0.0248) and (P2) 1.92+/-0.15 mg (n=33, P=0.0024). NILT started 12 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.89+/-1.76 mg (n=29, P=0.279); (P1) 2.40+/-0.99 mg (n=24, P=0.134). At the 6-h post-embolization treatment time, there was a statistically significant increase in P(50) values compared with control for both pulse P1 and P2 modes, but not the CW mode. At the 12-h post-embolization treatment time, neither the CW nor the P1 regimens resulted in statistically significant effect, although there was a trend for an improvement.

Since the installation of the ARED in the International Space Station Expedition 18, high resistances can be applied during strength training on the ISS and the device allows about 29 different exercises. However, the ARED is very space-consuming and carries the potential risk of being temporarily unavailable due to technical faults (Hanson et al., 2014; Loehr et al., 2015), which motivates the search for and the exploration of smaller and technically simpler devices (Behringer et al., 2016). In addition, high training intensities are associated with an increased risk of injury to the musculoskeletal system (Gabbett, 2016), a fact to be taken seriously, as training-related injuries are the most common source of injury to astronauts on board the ISS (Scheuring et al., 2009). Therefore, the question arises whether BFR training can be a reasonable alternative or supplement for in-flight training sessions. In the following sections, the effects of primarily mechanical stimuli on the musculature are briefly presented and compared with those of more metabolically accentuated stimuli through BFR training.""

1088,"A comparison of two systems of patient immobilization for prostate radiotherapy. BACKGROUND: Reproducibility of different immobilization systems, which may affect set-up errors, remains uncertain. Immobilization systems and their corresponding set-up errors influence the clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-PTV) margins and thus may result in undesirable treatment outcomes. This study compared the reproducibility of patient positioning with Hipfix system and whole body alpha cradle with respect to localized prostate cancer and investigated the existing CTV-PTV margins in the clinical oncology departments of two hospitals.METHODS: Forty sets of data of patients with localized T1-T3 prostate cancer were randomly selected from two regional hospitals, with 20 patients immobilized by a whole-body alpha cradle system and 20 by a thermoplastic Hipfix system. Seven sets of the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC) and medial-lateral (ML) deviations were collected from each patient. The reproducibility of patient positioning within the two hospitals was compared using a total vector error (TVE) parameter. In addition, CTV-PTV margins were computed using van Herk's formula. The resulting values were compared to the current CTV-PTV margins in both hospitals.RESULTS: The TVE values were 5.1 and 2.8 mm for the Hipfix and the whole-body alpha cradle systems respectively. TVE associated with the whole-body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly less than the Hipfix system (p < 0.05). The CC axis in the Hipfix system attained the highest frequency of large (23.6%) and serious (7.9%) set-up errors. The calculated CTV to PTV margin was 8.3, 1.9 and 2.3 mm for the Hipfix system, and 2.1, 3.4 and 1.8 mm for the whole body alpha cradle in CC, ML and AP axes respectively. All but one (CC axis using Hipfix) margin calculated did not exceed the corresponding hospital protocol. The whole body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly better than the Hipfix system in terms of reproducibility (p < 0.05), especially in the CC axis.CONCLUSIONS: The whole body alpha cradle system was more reproducible than the Hipfix system. In particular, the difference in CC axis contributed most to the results and the current CC margin for the Hipfix system might be considered as inadequate.",Excluded
2728,"Time of Flight 3D Magnetic Resonance Angiography in the Follow-up of Coiled Cerebral Aneurysms. SUMMARY: The use of Guglielmi Detachable Coil (GDC) for the en do vascular treatment of intracerebral aneurysms is increasing, particularly in those aneurysms for which there is a high surgical morbidity and mortality. However, the long-term efficacy of GDC is not known. Until the natural history of GDC treatment is established longterm follow-up in this cohort of patients is required, of necessity involving repeated intraarterial angiography (IA DSA) with its known attendant risks and exposure to ionising radiation. Three dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D TOF MRA) is now readily accepted as a non-invasive screening tool for familial aneurysmal disease and has been used as an alternative to IA DSA in the surgical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. MRA in patients treated with GDC is safe, imparts no radiation dose and provides acceptable image quality. The aim of this study was to assess 3D TOP MRA source data, maximum intensity projection (MIP) and 3D isosurface reconstruction in comparison to IA DSA in the follow-up of 25 patients treated with GDC. Images were assessed for parent and branch artery flow, the presence of neck recurrence and aneurysm regrowth. There was good correlation for all these features when 3D isosurface MRA and source data were compared with IA DSA. The correlation between MIP MRA and IA DSA was less robust. Additional confidence can be obtained by performing plain films of the skull to demonstrate change in coil ball configuration. MRA has the potential to replace IA DSA in the follow- up of GDC treated cerebral aneurysms.",Excluded
2286,"Morphologic comparisons between rhodopsin-mediated and short-wavelength classes of retinal light damage. The histologic manifestations of rhodopsin-mediated versus short-wavelength classes of retinal phototoxicity were compared after spectral exposures of the albino rat retina. Animals were exposed to wave-bands of light centered at the peak of rhodopsin absorbance (green, 500 nm) or in the ultraviolet A (UVA; 360 nm). Intensity-damage curves generated for each wave-band indicated that UVA light was 50-80 times more effective than green light at causing photoreceptor cell losses. Examination of early ultrastructural changes in rod inner segments, outer segments, and retinal pigment epithelium revealed a remarkable degree of similarity between UVA and green light-induced damage. Furthermore, the two classes of damage were indistinguishable in terms of post-exposure recovery from threshold damage and regional distribution of photoreceptor cell loss along the vertical meridian. The finding of essentially identical histologic manifestations for the two classes of damage raises the possibility that they share a common biochemical etiology or pathway of cell destruction.",Excluded
1422,"Is autonomic modulation different between European and Chinese astronauts?. PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate autonomic control in groups of European and Chinese astronauts and to identify similarities and differences.METHODS: Beat-to-beat heart rate and finger blood pressure, brachial blood pressure, and respiratory frequency were measured from 10 astronauts (five European taking part in three different space missions and five Chinese astronauts taking part in two different space missions). Data recording was performed in the supine and standing positions at least 10 days before launch, and 1, 3, and 10 days after return. Cross-correlation analysis of heart rate and systolic pressure was used to assess cardiac baroreflex modulation. A fixed breathing protocol was performed to measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency power of systolic blood pressure variability.RESULTS: Although baseline cardiovascular parameters before spaceflight were similar in all astronauts in the supine position, a significant increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in vagal modulation occurred in the European astronauts when standing; spaceflight resulted in a remarkable vagal decrease in European astronauts only. Similar baseline supine and standing values for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory frequency were shown in both groups. Standing autonomic control was based on a balance of higher vagal and sympathetic modulation in European astronauts.CONCLUSION: Post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was observed in all European astronauts, whereas post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was significantly reduced in Chinese astronauts. The basis for orthostatic intolerance is not apparent; however, many possibilities can be considered and need to be further investigated, such as genetic diversities between races, astronaut selection, training, and nutrition, etc.",Excluded
2284,"The susceptibility of the retina to photochemical damage from visible light. The photoreceptor/RPE complex must maintain a delicate balance between maximizing the absorption of photons for vision and retinal image quality while simultaneously minimizing the risk of photodamage when exposed to bright light. We review the recent discovery of two new effects of light exposure on the photoreceptor/RPE complex in the context of current thinking about the causes of retinal phototoxicity. These effects are autofluorescence photobleaching in which exposure to bright light reduces lipofuscin autofluorescence and, at higher light levels, RPE disruption in which the pattern of autofluorescence is permanently altered following light exposure. Both effects occur following exposure to visible light at irradiances that were previously thought to be safe. Photopigment, retinoids involved in the visual cycle, and bisretinoids in lipofuscin have been implicated as possible photosensitizers for photochemical damage. The mechanism of RPE disruption may follow either of these paths. On the other hand, autofluorescence photobleaching is likely an indicator of photooxidation of lipofuscin. The permanent changes inherent in RPE disruption might require modification of the light safety standards. AF photobleaching recovers after several hours although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet clear. Understanding the mechanisms of phototoxicity is all the more important given the potential for increased susceptibility in the presence of ocular diseases that affect either the visual cycle and/or lipofuscin accumulation. In addition, knowledge of photochemical mechanisms can improve our understanding of some disease processes that may be influenced by light exposure, such as some forms of Leber's congenital amaurosis, and aid in the development of new therapies. Such treatment prior to intentional light exposures, as in ophthalmic examinations or surgeries, could provide an effective preventative strategy.",Excluded

1741,"""Soundmorphing"": a new approach to studying speech perception in humans. A problem in current studies of brain activation in speech perception is that most studies use stimuli that are sampled from different categories. This study presents a new approach in creating acoustic stimuli by filtering real words in different ways, thus this enables one to 'morph' the sounds gradually from something like tones to real words while preserving temporal characteristics (""soundmorphing""). This will make it possible to explore steps between tone and speech processing on a gradual scale. This study aimed to investigate more closely the network, involved in the perception of speech and the decoding of auditory (speech-)stimuli. Sets of auditory stimuli were created by dividing real words into several frequency-bands and creating a randomised rearrangement of these components. Four different sets of stimuli were used, containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 frequency bands (total range: 0-2500 Hz). Only the latter one contained intelligible words. During the fMRI session, these four trial types were presented pseudo-randomised. In all conditions, significant activations of auditory cortex were observed. The number of activated voxels and their significance increased over the four trial types. In addition, Broca's area, SMA, left thalamus, and right cerebellum were activated in the most complex and most speech-like condition. Comparing these complexes with the tone-like trials, only the left auditory cortex, left SMA, and cingulate gyrus became significant. These activations reflect the bilateral processing of the auditory stimuli, but only the left temporal areas demonstrated an increasing BOLD response with an increasing number of presented frequency components.",Excluded

RATIONALE: The clinical prognosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) patients is poor. Therefore, effective treatment is still a challenge at present. Moreover, little is known about the value of radiotherapy in the treatment of PTCL-NOS.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old male patient with eating difficulties and progressive exacerbation for 3 months was diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Airway compression occurred after 2 cycles of first line treatment with cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone regimen, radiotherapy (48Gy/24f) was given as the second line therapy.DIAGNOSIS: After radiotherapy, the patient complained that mild intermittent dysphagia still existed. Endoscopic biopsy of the upper digestive tract confirmed necrotic material and superficial squamous epithelial mucosa, suggesting esophageal stricture after radiotherapy, which was indistinguishable from tumor residue.INTERVENTIONS: The patient received anti-inflammatory treatment outside the hospital and did not receive any other special treatment.OUTCOMES: The symptoms of dysphagia disappeared and the focus showed complete response (CR). As of October 1, 2020, the patient has been diagnosed with PTCL-NOS for more than 57 months and the overall survival (OS) have not been achieved.LESSONS: Radiotherapy has obvious and rapid anti-tumor effect on cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone refractory PTCL-NOS.

Purpose: This study aims to identify the challenges in clinical use of the EXTENDTM relocatable head frame (RHF) and to qualitatively report the patient's experience. Materials/Methods: Patients and volunteers enrolled on two prospective clinical trials were fitted, positioned, and immobilized using the RHF. The RHF includes a patient-specific detachable front mouthpiece for dental and hard palate impression. A vacuum is applied to ensure tensionless fixation without the need for active patient cooperation. For positioning, a 1mm action threshold was used. To capture the tolerability of the RHF, subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire immediately after initial fitting, CT simulation, and at the end of their treatment. The questions addressed overall impression and discomfort during the various stages of the procedure. Result(s): Six volunteers completed study procedures without difficulty. Of 21 patients enrolled, one patient was aborted due to geometric constraints of the RHF colliding with his skull, and one patient withdrew from study participation. For the four patients treated on Perfexion the mean difference between CT and PFX position was less than 1mm.Patient anatomy including a high palate, short neck, and broad shoulders were identified as challenges to clinical use of the RHF. Gagging during fitting occurred in six patients and with one patient during positioning. Qualitative review of questionnaires revealed 5 themes: (1) patients have an overall positive impression of the process; (2) most find the dental imprint procedure distressing; (3) positioning was fairly tolerated; (4) overall discomfort during the time of immobilization is none to mild in the hard palate; (5) discomfort to the neck, shoulders and back is mild. Conclusion(s): The study result highlights challenges related to the dental impression procedure, and the importance of a careful patient selection. From the patients perspective the procedure is fairly well tolerated, and may improve by addressing discomforts during the fitting procedure.

529,"Tryptophan pet has a strong prognostic value in post-treatment high-grade gliomas. BACKGROUND: MRI has limited prognostic value in patients with previously treated high-grade gliomas. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT), a radiotracer tracking tryptophan transport and metabolism via the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway, can accurately differentiate glioma recurrence from radiation injury (J Nucl Med 2012;53:1058-64). We evaluated AMT uptake as a prognostic marker for survival in post-treatment patients with high-grade glioma. METHOD(S): AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients > 1 month (median: 325 days) after resection and chemoradiation of a grade III or IV astrocytic glioma. All patients were followed for at least 1 year or until death after PET. Maximum standardized uptake values (AMT-SUVmax) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor on MRI. Unidirectional AMT uptake (K) was also quantified from dynamic PETand blood radioactivity data (available in 34 cases). Optimal cutoff thresholds for prediction of 1-year survival were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and survival of patients with above vs. below threshold values was evaluated in thewhole group, and in two subgroups (glioblastoma [n = 33], no further surgical or radiation treatment after PET [n = 22]). RESULT(S): For 1-year survival, sensitivity/specificity was 84%/80% for AMT-SUVmax and 76%/88% for lesion/cortex K-ratio, when using ROC-defined cutoff thresholds. Both AMT-SUVmax and K-ratio were highly prognostic for survival in all patient groups. Estimated median survival after PET was 966 and 876 days in the low, vs. 177 days in both the high AMT-SUVmax and high K-ratio groups, respectively (log-rank: p, > 001). Age- and gradecorrected Cox regression analyses showed a robust association between high AMT values and shorter overall survival after the PET scan (SUVmax: OR= 6.2 [2.2-17.5], K-ratio: OR= 6.6 [2.3-18.6]; p<= > 001).

1608,"Hifu generated fast hyperthermia as a new option for glioblastoma treatment. Introduction: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, corresponding to grade IV of the World Health Organization histological classification (Louis et al., 2007). High grade gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, with an incidence of 3.1 per 100,000 person-year in the USA and the median survival times of 14.6 months (Stupp et al., 2005) after first occurrence and 11.9 after the first re-resection (Quick et al., 2014). Against to this pathology, we proposed (Borasi et al., 2014) the use of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Material(s) and Method(s): The first brain tumor ablation treatments with the magnetic resonance (MR) guided HIFU (Exablate Neuro), recently described (Coluccia et al., 2014), revealed the power limitation of the system in penetrating the skull bone so that only a small tumor volume could be ablated. We then concentrate ourselves on the use of this HIFU device for administering, on a larger possible volume, a low power ""fast hyperthermia"", coupled with a standard EBRT protocol. We simulated the combined effect of radiotherapy (EBRT) and fast hyperthermia (FH) in the mathematical frame of Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. A new formulation of the synergistic effect has been developed. Result(s): The EBRT plus FH should be able to overcome the main problem of GBM treatments, that is, the progressive modification to a more aggressive and resistant entity, due to a subset of glioma cells that share many characteristics with stem cells (Galli et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2004). These cells are generally resistant to RX and TMZ and are considered a cause of recurrence (Bao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012). Conclusion(s): The assumption that hyperthermia can sensitize glioma stemlike cells to radiation has been recently verified by Man et al. (2015). The EBRT plus (HIFU generated) FH treatments deserve, in our opinion, a large scale trial to give a new therapeutic perspective to this devastating pathology.",Excluded

OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been shown to be effective for treating many patients with brain metastasis. Some brain metastases demonstrate significant peritumoral edema; radiation may induce cerebral edema or worsening preexisting edema. This study was conducted to evaluate the imaging and neurobehavioral outcomes in patients with preexisting peritumoral edema who then undergo GKS.METHODS: Between August 2003 and January 2008, 63 cases of brain metastasis with significant peritumoral edema (> 20 cm(3)) were prospectively studied. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a single metastatic lesion with significant edema (perilesional edema signal volume on FLAIR > 20 cm(3)); and 2) inclusion of only 1 lesion > 20 cm(3) in the study (in cases of multiple lesions noted on FLAIR images). All patients received MR imaging with pulse sequences including T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR with or without contrast and T2-weighted imaging at an interval of 3 months. A neurological assessment and Brain Cancer Module (BCM-20) questionnaire were obtained every 2-3 months. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: This study represents the first step toward testing the hypothesis that hypergravity can be used as a unique resistance training modality for maintaining the health and function of skeletal muscle in microgravity. The primary objectives of this study were to use a human-powered short-arm centrifuge for the following: 1) to determine whether subjects could perform squats under hypergravity conditions without developing motion sickness or illusory motion; 2) to measure foot forces while performing squats under hypergravity conditions; and 3) to determine the mechanical power required to produce 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz (head to foot) at the feet.METHODS: Subjects (22 males and 19 females) performed 10 squats each at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz on a human-powered short-arm centrifuge, the space cycle. Foot forces during each squat were monitored using insole force sensors, and normalized to foot forces measured at 1 Gz (relative foot forces).RESULTS: Illusory motion was minimized using a visual focal point, and did not affect the ability of subjects to perform squats. The mean standing relative foot forces at 3.0 Gz were 2.3 and 2.4 for the male and female subjects, respectively. The work rate required to power the space cycle was a linear function of Gz, and is well within the aerobic scope of untrained individuals.DISCUSSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that hypergravity can be used as an effective modality for loading skeletal muscle and that subjects can perform squat resistance exercise without developing motion sickness or illusory motion.",Excluded

We investigated the temperature distribution, early histological changes, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and sequential changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) following hyperthermia ranging from 37 to 45 degrees C in a new rat model of radiofrequency-induced localized cerebral hyperthermia. Significant histological changes and BBB disruption were observed in brain regions heated to 43 degrees C and above. In the cortex heated to 41 degrees C, the CBF doubled 20 min after hyperthermia induction, and then returned gradually to the pre-hyperthermic level. In the cortex heated to 43 degrees C, the CBF increased to 134% of the baseline level 10 min after hyperthermia induction, and then fell gradually to reach its minimum level (31% of the baseline level). In the cortex heated to 45 degrees C, the CBF decreased immediately after hyperthermia induction to reach 10% of the baseline level. The results indicate that hyperthermia-induced cellular injury in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral ischaemia and the threshold temperature for such injury is 43 degrees C. This model is useful for investigating the effects of hyperthermia on various cerebral functions and the CBF changes demonstrated in the present study may provide key information for the analysis of other cerebral functions.",Excluded

Overall, no significant increase in incidences or numbers, either in the males or females, was detected in the EMF-exposed groups. In addition, no clear changes in tumor types in the brain were evident. Thus, under the present experimental conditions, exposure of heads of rats to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 for a 2-year period was not demonstrated to accelerate or otherwise affect ENU-initiated brain tumorigenesis.",Excluded
2154,"A histological and ultrastructural study of the skin of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) alevins exposed to different levels of ultraviolet B radiation. The current study was conducted to evaluate the effects of UV-B radiation on survival rate and histopathological changes in the skin structure and ultrastructure in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) alevins. In laboratory dark conditions, newly hatched rainbow trout alevins were exposed to two different doses of UV-B radiation (high dose: HD: 94.83 muW cm(-2)) and (low dose: LD: 68.75 muW cm(-2)) for 9 days (time of exposure: 15 min per day), whereas specimens kept in darkness served as a control group. At the end of the experiment, alevins exposed to HD-UVB had the lowest survival rate (43.9 +/- 0.9%), whereas fish exposed to LD-UVB showed intermediate values (73.6 +/- 0.4%) with regard to the control group (91.2 +/- 0.2%). Light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic studies revealed necrosis, sunburned cells, epidermis lifting of the epidermis, reduced number of mucous cells, degeneration of mucous cells and destruction of pavement cell microridges in both UV-B exposed groups. Hemorrhage and inflation in the meningeal layer of the brain were also observed in 17% and 42% of fish exposed to LD- and HD-UVB, respectively.",Excluded
2634,"Does the Gamma Knife dose rate affect outcomes in radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia?. OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN).METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months.RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479).CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded

A total of 22 NZW rabbits with VX2 squamous cell carcinomas transplanted into the auricles were intra-arterially (i.a.) embolized with radioactive or inactive holmium-labelled poly(L-lactic acid) (HoPLA) microspheres with a mean diameter of 38-80 microm. The effects on tumour growth, the efficiency of i.a. infusion, the efficacy of retention of microspheres in the primary tumour and the excretion of free holmium-166 were analyzed. Complete tumour remissions were obtained in 79% and 86% following embolization with radioactive and inactive microspheres, respectively. Over 95% of the microspheres were retained in the tumour and the leaching of holmium-166 in urine and faeces was less than 0.1% in 2 days. The injection efficiency was not optimal, as 40% of the microspheres were retained in the cannulation system. Arterio-arteriolar connections should be detected and closed prior to embolization to prevent stray emboli from entering the brain. It is concluded that 166HoPLA microspheres are promising candidates for further studies on radio-embolization of unresectable head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded
2755,"Measuring smoking-induced extrastriatal dopamine release: A [11C]FLB-457 pet study. Background: Preclinical studies indicate that nicotine can induce dopamine (DA) release in striatal and cortical brain regions, contributing to the reinforcing and cognitive effects respectively. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies using the D2/3 radiotracer [11C] raclopride to indirectly measure DA release via receptor occupancy have confirmed that tobacco smoking releases DA in striatal regions in humans. However, due to the low density of DA receptors in the cortex it was not possible to measure extrastriatal DA release in humans until the recent development of high affinity D2/3 radiotracers. In this study we used the high affinity D2/3 radiotracer [11C]FLB-457 to index tobacco-induced extrastriatal DA release in smokers. Method(s): Ten nicotine-dependent daily cigarette smokers underwent two high affinity [11C]FLB-457 PET scans: after overnight abstinence and smoking reinstatement (biochemically verified by expired carbon monoxide and plasma nicotine levels). Craving, withdrawal, mood and cognitive performance were assessed under both smoking conditions. Voxel-wise parameter estimation of binding potential (BPND) was performed using the basis function implementation of SRTM with the tissue time activity curve of the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Spatially normalized [11C]FLB-457 BPND maps were statistically investigated to assess significant changes between the two conditions at every voxel using paired-tests (SPM 8). Results from the whole-brain voxel-wise paired t-test (abstinence 4 smoking) were masked with a map of a-priori regions of interest and subjected to an uncorrected threshold of p<0.05, with a minimum 30-voxel cluster extent. Result(s): There was a reduction [11C]FLB-457 BPND following smoking (an indirect measure of DA release) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 323 voxels, peak t=3.38, p=0.004), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC / ACC; 1496 voxels, peak t=5.32, p<0.001), both of which survived a more stringent threshold of p<0.01, and the left insula (47 voxels, peak t=2.54 p=0.016). Exploratory analysis focused on limbic regions identified an effect in the bilateral amygdala (Left: 102 voxels, peak t=3.28, p=0.005; Right: 108 voxels, peak t =3.03, p=0.007). Extraction of values from these clusters revealed % changes in BPND in smoking versus abstinence conditions of -12.0% (SD=9.4) in the dlPFC, -11.5% (SD=12.8) in the dmPFC/ACC, -7.1% (SD=7.9) in the left insula and -13.1% in the bilateral amygdala. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of smoking-induced DA release in cortical regions such as the dlPFC, dmPFC and ACC. There was also some evidence for DA release in the insula and amygdala. The dmPFC, ACC, insula and amygdala are regions consistently associated with tobacco cue-presentaton, subjective craving and relapse susceptibility in fMRI studies, while the dlPFC appears to exert top-down control on tobacco craving and is involved in tobacco's pro-cognitive effects. As such [11C]FLB- 457 may be a useful tool to investigate individual differences in tobacco addiction severity and treatment response.",Excluded

Pretreatment hematologic markers (platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase) and other clinical characteristics were evaluated for correlation with brain metastases-free survival (BMFS). Cutoffs were established with receiver operating characteristics curves. Factors significant in univariate analysis were used to build a multivariate Cox model for BMFS. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 14.3 months. Brain metastases developed in 115 patients (39%)-32% of those with low pretreatment platelet counts (PPC) (<=270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and 46% of those with high PPC (>270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Median BMFS time for all patients was 27.9 months. Two-year BMFS rates were worse for patients with high PPC (14.6% vs. 22.1% low, P = 0.009). High PPC was independently associated with inferior BMFS (P = 0.038), as were receipt of TRT <45 Gy and no prophylactic cranial irradiation (both P < 0.001).

2128,"Dose-dependent effects of small-vessel disease MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and structural connectivity. Background: MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, and microbleeds are related to cognitive dysfunction in subjects with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Previous studies have usually focused on the location of these vascular markers and did not consider the concomitant effect by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this study, we aimed to find dose-dependent effects of these MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in VCI patients, considering the effect by concomitant AD pathology. Method(s): Participants consisted of 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI) and 69 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Conventional brain MRI scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and PIB PET were performed. WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and PIB retention amount were measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to elucidate the relationship between regional cortical thickness, DTI abnormalities, and each small vessel vascular marker, adjusting the effects by demographic factors and PIB retention amount. Result(s): Higher WMH volume was associated with cortical thinning in bilateral cingulate cortices, right insular cortex, and left lingual gyrus. More lacunes were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial and superior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Microbleeds were not related with regional cortical thinning. Higher PIB retention was associated with cortical thinning in left medial temporal lobe. Independent of other vascular markers and PIB retention amount, larger WMH volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread periventricular white matter region. Regardless of PIB retention amount, more lacunes were associated with decreased FA in bilateral posterior and anterior corona radiata, right anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, and bilateral precuneus. Microbleeds had association with decreased FA in the bilateral posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. PIB retention amount was not related with regional FA decrease. The association between neuropsychological scores and vascularmarkers were generally compatible with findings from cortical thickness and DTI analyses. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that small vessel vascular markers in VCI patients are related with regional cortical thinning and white matter abnormalities in a dosedependent manner regardless of AD pathology.",Excluded
91,"Bone Pain in Cancer Patients: Mechanisms and Current Treatment. The skeletal system is the third most common site for cancer metastases, surpassed only by the lungs and liver. Many tumors, especially those of the breast, prostate, lungs, and kidneys, have a strong predilection to metastasize to bone, which causes pain, hypercalcemia, pathological skeletal fractures, compression of the spinal cord or other nervous structures, decreased mobility, and increased mortality. Metastatic cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a type of chronic pain with unique and complex pathophysiology characterized by nociceptive and neuropathic components. Its treatment should be multimodal (pharmacological and non-pharmacological), including causal anticancer and symptomatic analgesic treatment to improve quality of life (QoL). The aim of this paper is to discuss the mechanisms involved in the occurrence and persistence of cancer-associated bone pain and to review the treatment methods recommended by experts in clinical practice. The final part of the paper reviews experimental therapeutic methods that are currently being studied and that may improve the efficacy of bone pain treatment in cancer patients in the future.",Excluded

Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the role of flattening filter-free (FFF) beams in volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy for patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC). Method(s): 13 patients with rNPC were replanned for FFF RapidArc<sup>-></sup> (RA-FFF) and conventional RapidArc (RA) (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Quantitative evaluation was performed for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Phantom dose verifications, treatment delivery time and monitor units (MUs) were also assessed. Result(s): Each technique delivered similar doses to the PTV. RA-FFF had a better sparing effect on the brain stem and normal tissue when compared with RA, whereas RA provided lower mean doses to the skin. No significant difference between the two techniques could be established for other OAR parameters. Both techniques showed equally good gamma scores in dosimetric verification. RAFFF required more MUs than RA, whereas the delivery time for RA-FFF was slightly shorter than for RA. Conclusion(s): Both treatment plans met the planning objectives. Dose measurements also showed good agreement with computed doses. In addition to slightly faster delivery times, RA-FFF produced better sparing of brain stem and normal tissue with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA. Advances in knowledge: FFF beams have recently been assembled for clinical use. Our findings show RA-FFF is useful in the salvage treatment of rNPC owing to better brain stem and normal tissue sparing with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA. This may be beneficial in the case of tumour invasion close to the brain stem. Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by the British Institute of Radiology.",Excluded

Background and Purpose - Patients with carotid occlusive disease and stage 2 cerebral hemodynamic failure, characterized by an increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and otherwise known as misery perfusion, have a high risk of cerebral ischemia and subsequent stroke. In clinical practice, the detection of patients with misery perfusion through the use of widely available, noninvasive, and cost-effective modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is extremely important. Methods - We evaluated the relationships between the regional hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation, measured with split-dose [<sup>123</sup>I] N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine SPECT (<sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT) and an acetazolamide challenge, and hemodynamic parameters, including OEF measured with PET, in 27 patients with both unilateral and bilateral carotid occlusive diseases. Results - A significant negative correlation was found between the SPECT-measured cerebrovascular reserve after acetazolamide administration and both the PET-measured OEF and cerebral blood volume. Neither the cerebrovascular reserve nor the cerebral blood flow index, when expressed as a SPECT-measured cerebrum-to-cerebellum ratio, was useful for detecting lesions with an elevated OEF. However, a combination of the cerebrovascular reserve and cerebral blood flow index showed high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the detection of misery perfusion. Conclusions - Our study suggests that split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT with an acetazolamide challenge could be useful for screening patients with misery perfusion in carotid occlusive diseases.",Excluded
1410,"A semianalytic model to investigate the potential applications of x-ray scatter imaging. Although x-ray scatter is generally regarded as a nuisance that reduces radiographic contrast (C) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in conventional images, many technologies have been devised to extract useful information from the scattered x rays. A systematic approach, however, for analyzing the potential applications of x-ray scatter imaging has been lacking. Therefore, we have formulated a simple but useful semianalytic model to investigate C and SNR in scatter images. Our model considers the imaging of a target object against a background material of the same dimensions when both are situated within a water phantom. We have selected biological materials (liver, fat, bone, muscle, blood, and brain matter) for which intermolecular form factors for coherent scattering were available. Analytic relationships between C and SNR were derived, and evaluated numerically as the target object thickness (0.01-40 mm) and photon energy (10-200 keV) were systematically varied. The fundamental limits of scatter imaging were assessed via calculations that assumed that all first-order scatter exiting the phantom, over 4pi steradians, formed the signal. Calculations for a restricted detector solid angle were then performed. For the task of imaging white brain matter versus blood in a 15 cm thick water phantom, the maximum SNR, over all energies, for images based on the detection of all forward scatter within the angular range 2degree- 12degreeis greater than that of primary images for target object thicknesses <= 23 mm. Use of the backscattered x rays within the range 158degree-178degreeto image objects 3 cm below the surface of a 25 cm thick water phantom allows the liver to be distinguished from fat with a SNR superior to that of primary imaging when the objects are <=22 mm thick. Our analysis confirms the usefulness of scattered x rays, and provides simple methods for determining the regimes of medical interest in which x-ray scatter imaging could outperform conventional imaging.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To compare temporal lobe dose delivered by three pituitary macroadenoma irradiation techniques: three-field three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), three-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (3F IMRT), and a proposed novel alternative of five-field IMRT (5F IMRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Computed tomography-based external beam radiotherapy planning was performed for 15 pituitary macroadenoma patients treated at New York University between 2002 and 2007 using: 3D-CRT (two lateral, one midline superior anterior oblique [SAO] beams), 3F IMRT (same beam angles), and 5F IMRT (same beam angles with additional right SAO and left SAO beams). Prescription dose was 45 Gy. Target volumes were: gross tumor volume (GTV) = macroadenoma, clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV, and planning target volume = CTV + 0.5 cm. Structure contouring was performed by two radiation oncologists guided by an expert neuroradiologist.RESULTS: Five-field IMRT yielded significantly decreased temporal lobe dose delivery compared with 3D-CRT and 3F IMRT. Temporal lobe sparing with 5F IMRT was most pronounced at intermediate doses: mean V25Gy (% of total temporal lobe volume receiving >=25 Gy) of 13% vs. 28% vs. 29% for right temporal lobe and 14% vs. 29% vs. 30% for left temporal lobe for 5F IMRT, 3D-CRT, and 3F IMRT, respectively (p < 10(-7) for 5F IMRT vs. 3D-CRT and 5F IMRT vs. 3F IMRT). Five-field IMRT plans did not compromise target coverage, exceed normal tissue dose constraints, or increase estimated brain integral dose.CONCLUSIONS: Five-field IMRT irradiation technique results in a statistically significant decrease in the dose to the temporal lobes and may thus help prevent neurocognitive sequelae in irradiated pituitary macroadenoma patients.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma entails uncertain long-term risk of tumor recurrence and delayed cranial neuropathies. In addition, the underlying histopathologic changes to the tumor bed are not fully characterized. We seek to understand the clinical and histologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiation therapy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Four patients who underwent microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma after primary stereotactic radiation therapy.INTERVENTION: Patients were treated primarily with gamma knife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy followed by salvage microsurgery. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was used in all cases.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathologic review. Preoperative and postoperative facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann scale.RESULTS: We observed highly inconsistent radiation changes in the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal. Fibrosis outside and within the tumor bed varied markedly, complicating microsurgical dissection. Light microscopy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in all cases. Histopathologic features were typical of vestibular schwannoma, and there was no significant scarring that could be attributed to radiation effect.CONCLUSIONS: The variable fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle and lack of radiation changes seen histopathologically in irradiated vestibular schwannoma suggest that a uniform treatment effect was not achieved in these cases. Although all four patients with preoperative cranial neuropathies were found intraoperatively to have fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle, excellent preservation of facial nerve anatomy and function was possible with salvage microsurgical resection. Additional analyses are needed to clarify the histopathologic and molecular characteristics associated with vestibular schwannoma growth after stereotactic radiation. [References: 58]",Excluded
2742,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and alzheimer's disease. Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy age-matched controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Rates of decline were -0.028 FA units per year in FTLD in the genu of the CC, and -0.017 FA units per year in AD in splenium of the CC. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded

D609 (tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate) is a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor that also has been reported to protect rodents against oxidative damage caused by lethal doses of ionizing radiation. We previously showed that D609 mimics glutathione. D609 has a free thiol group, which upon oxidation forms a disulfide. The resulting dixanthate is a substrate for glutathione reductase, regenerating D609. Recent studies from our laboratory have also shown that D609 reduces the Alzheimer amyloid beta-peptide (1-42)-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in neuronal cell culture. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that D609 would provide neuroprotection against free radical oxidative stress in vivo. Synaptosomes isolated from gerbils, previously injected intraperitoneally (ip) with D609, were treated with the oxidants Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or 2,2-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), which produce free radicals.

3129,"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional brain positron emission tomography. Reliable attenuation correction represents an essential component of the long chain of modules required for the reconstruction of artifact-free, quantitative brain positron emission tomography (PET) images. In this work we demonstrate the proof of principle of segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional (3D) brain PET. We have developed a method for attenuation correction based on registered T1-weighted MRI, eliminating the need of an additional transmission (TX) scan. The MR images were realigned to preliminary reconstructions of PET data using an automatic algorithm and then segmented by means of a fuzzy clustering technique which identifies tissues of significantly different density and composition. The voxels belonging to different regions were classified into air, skull, brain tissue and nasal sinuses. These voxels were then assigned theoretical tissue-dependent attenuation coefficients as reported in the ICRU 44 report followed by Gaussian smoothing and addition of a good statistics bed image. The MRI-derived attenuation map was then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to be used for correcting the emission (EM) data. The method was evaluated and validated on 10 patient data where TX and MRI brain images were available. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of differences between TX-guided and segmented MRI-guided 3D reconstructions were performed by visual assessment and by estimating parameters of clinical interest. The results indicated a small but noticeable improvement in image quality as a consequence of the reduction of noise propagation from TX into EM data. Considering the difficulties associated with preinjection TX-based attenuation correction and the limitations of current calculated attenuation correction, MRI-based attenuation correction in 3D brain PET would likely be the method of choice for the foreseeable future as a second best approach in a busy nuclear medicine center and could be applied to other functional brain imaging modalities such as SPECT.",Excluded

BACKGROUND/AIM: For treatment personalization in elderly cancer patients, survival prognoses should be considered. We developed an instrument to estimate survival of elderly patients with brain metastasis from gynecological cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 15 patients, whole-brain radiotherapy regimen, tumor site, age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), number of brain metastases, extra-cerebral metastases and interval from diagnosis of gynecological cancer until radiotherapy were retrospectively evaluated for survival.

107,"Neurocognitive deficits after radiation therapy for brain malignancies. Radiotherapy (RT) has proven to be an effective therapeutic tool in treatment of a wide variety of brain tumors; however, it has a negative impact on quality of life and neurocognitive function. Cognitive dysfunction associated with both the disease and adverse effects of RT is one of the most concerning complication among long-term survivors. The effects of RT to brain can be divided into acute, early delayed, and late delayed. It is, however, the late delayed effects of RT that lead to severe neurological consequences such as minor-to-severe cognitive deficits due to irreversible focal or diffuse necrosis of brain parenchyma. In this review, we discuss current and emerging data regarding the relationship between RT and neurocognitive outcomes, and therapeutic strategies to prevent/treat postradiation neurocognitive deficits.

1568,"Radiosurgical treatment for epilepsy associated with cavernomas. Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain, which often present with drug-resistant epilepsy. Microsurgical excision remains the preferred approach for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of Gamma Knife (GK) surgery in the management of drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs in a retrospective multicenter study. Forty-nine patients with cortical or subcortical CMs with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these GK procedures was 7.5 (+/-9.3) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 6.9/month (+/-14). The mean marginal radiation dose was 19.17 Gy. At the last follow-up examination, 53% were seizure free. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for another 20%. The remaining 26% of patients showed little or no improvement. The morbidity was low. Radiosurgery is a promising management modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome.

These two modes of repair were characterized and compared between the aforementioned EPF, A. niger and N. crassa using a physiological assay where per cent survival post-UV irradiation was scored as colony forming units.CONCLUSIONS: The results showed B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are the most UV-tolerant EPF. The DNA repair capabilities indicated that EPF do not have all DNA repair options available to fungi, such as A. niger and N. crassa.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A key factor detrimental to the survival of EPF in agro-ecosystems is UV light from solar radiation. The EPF literature pertaining to UV irradiation is varied with respect to methodology, UV source, and dose, which prevented comparisons. Here we have characterized the fungi by a standard method and established the repair capabilities of EPF under optimal conditions.",Excluded

Whole cell inward currents activated by intracellular photorelease of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were investigated in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones. The actions of two distinct types of caged cGMP (NPE-caged cGMP and a highly water-soluble caged cGMP) were compared. Rapidly activating inward currents were evoked by cGMP in a subpopulation (12.5%) of neurones and these currents may be due to activity of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. In contrast in 52% of DRG neurones intracellular photorelease of cGMP activated a delayed Ca(2+)-dependent inward current through the generation of cyclic ADPribose and mobilisation of Ca(2+) from ryanodine sensitive intracellular stores. Similar delayed inward currents were activated by both caged compounds but only NPE-caged cGMP evoked rapidly activating currents. Cyclic GMP appears to increase excitability in some DRG neurones by diverse mechanisms.,Excluded

Sensorimotor cortex (SMC) modifies spinal cord reflex function throughout life and is essential for operant conditioning of the H-reflex. To further explore this long-term SMC influence over spinal cord function and its possible clinical uses, we assessed the effect of long-term SMC stimulation on the soleus H-reflex. In freely moving rats, the soleus H-reflex was measured 24 h/day for 12 wk. The soleus background EMG and M response associated with H-reflex elicitation were kept stable throughout. SMC stimulation was delivered in a 20-day-on/20-day-off/20-day-on protocol in which a train of biphasic 1-ms pulses at 25 Hz for 1 s was delivered every 10 s for the on-days. The SMC stimulus was automatically adjusted to maintain a constant descending volley. H-reflex size gradually increased during the 20 on-days, stayed high during the 20 off-days, and rose further during the next 20 on-days. In addition, the SMC stimulus needed to maintain a stable descending volley rose steadily over days. It fell during the 20 off-days and rose again when stimulation resumed. These results suggest that SMC stimulation, like H-reflex operant conditioning, induces activity-dependent plasticity in both the brain and the spinal cord and that the plasticity responsible for the H-reflex increase persists longer after the end of SMC stimulation than that underlying the change in the SMC response to stimulation.",Excluded
1456,"[Rules of application and mode of action of transcranial direct current stimulation in neurorehabilitation: primary motor cortex]. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging technique of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been found useful in facilitating treatment of various neurological disorders, especially stroke. Currently available criteria for single application of several minutes-long stimulation at 1-2 mA have been considered safe. However, knowledge regarding safety parameters of repeated and long-term electrical stimulation is so far limited. Studies on the use of tDCS focus predominantly on the motor cortex. They demonstrate that weak direct current is capable of eliciting cortical excitability changes which occur during and after stimulation. The nature of these changes is specific for current polarity - anodal stimulation enhances excitability, and cathodal reduces it. Studies indicate that tDCS effects are generated by polarity-driven alterations of membrane potentials and efficacy modulations of specific neuronal receptors. According to interhemispheric competition models, possible mechanisms underlying functional improvements due to stimulation in patients with stroke are attributed to tDCS-induced modification of inappropriate interhemispheric inhibition.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an algorithm named AutoRef to delineate a reference region for quantitative PET amyloid imaging.METHODS: AutoRef sets the reference region automatically using a distinguishing feature in the kinetics of reference region. This is reflected in the shapes of the tissue time activity curve. A statistical shape recognition algorithm of the gaussian mixture model is applied with considering spatial and temporal information on a reference region. We evaluate the BP<sub>ND</sub> with manually set reference region and AutoRef using 86 cases (43 positive cases, 10 equivocal cases, and 33 negative cases) of dynamically scanned <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound-B.RESULTS: From the Bland-Altman plot, the difference between two BP<sub>ND</sub> is 0.099 +/- 0.21 as standard deviation, and no significant systematic error is observed between the BP<sub>ND</sub> with AutoRef and with manual definition of a reference region. Although a proportional error is detected, it is smaller than the 95% limits of agreement. Therefore, the proportional error is negligibly small.CONCLUSIONS: AutoRef presents the same performance as the manual definition of the reference region. Further, since AutoRef is more algorithmic than the ordinary manual definition of the reference region, there are few operator-oriented uncertainties in AutoRef. We thus conclude that AutoRef can be applied as an automatic delineating algorithm for the reference region in amyloid imaging.",Excluded

Method(s): The study included consecutive pregnant patients who underwent spinal surgery at five neurosurgical high-volume centers between 2010 and 2017. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were derived from medical records. Result(s): Overall, 23 pregnant patients were assigned to acute spinal surgery. Two of them underwent preoperative cesarian section in the 34th and 32th week. The other 21 patients underwent surgery during pregnancy. Three patients were operated upon twice or more during the same pregnancy. The median age was 33 years (min 22, max 41 years). The median gestational age was 13 completed weeks (min 7, max 34 weeks). The indications were: n = 14 lumbar herniated intervertebral discs presenting with cauda equina syndrome in 4 cases, high graded motor deficit in 7 cases, and acute pain in 3 cases; n = 4 unstable spine injuries; n = 1 intramedullary tumor with paraparesis; n = 1 paraspinal infection; n = 1 swann cell nerve root tumor presenting with higher graded paresis. Perioperative pregnancy monitoring was done with an ultrasound or ultrasound plus CTG after the 24th week of gestation in the majority of cases. All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia (balanced anaesthesia n = 12, total intravenous anaesthesia n = 9). Median duration of surgery was 90 min (min 41, max 240). 15 patients were placed in a prone position and 6 in a right or left lateral decubitus position depending on the gestational age and the type of surgery. In 9 cases no intraoperative fluoroscopy was done, in 12 cases fluoroscopic verficiation of spine level or guidance of instrumentation placement was performed with a median fluoroscopic time of 6 s (min 1, max 24 s). No postoperative neurosurgical complications occured. Two patients underwent medical abortion due to radiation exposure before the pregnancy was diagnosed. Among the other 19 patients, 2 suffered transient gestational diabetes, and one patient presented with vaginal bleeding without any signs for fetal complications. According to our current follow-up data, no miscarriages, stillbirths or other severe obstetric complications occured during the further courses of pregnancy. All patients improved neurologically after the surgery. Conclusion(s): Spinal surgical procedures during pregnancy seem to be generally safe.

Background: Even after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), many small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients succumb to brain metastasis. Brain metastasis after PCI is an unsolved issue in SCLC in terms of its dismal prognosis and the limitation of further treatment options. Regarding the treatment option, it is not determined whether re-whole brain radiotherapy (re-WBRT) is safe or gamma-knife surgery (GKS) has its role in SCLC. We investigated which treatment option could be recommended as the up-front therapy to improve survival for SCLC patients with brain metastasis who were previously treated with PCI. Method(s): The medical records were reviewed for SCLC patients who experienced brain metastases after receiving PCI from 2000 to 2010. We compared overall survival according to the modality of up-front therapy. Overall survival was determined as time from brain metastasis to death due to any cause. Result(s): In total, 245 patients had received PCI in a state of limited disease (n = 204) or extensive disease status (n = 41). Among them, 47 (19.2%) experienced brain metastases: 16.7% (34/204) in LD and 31.7% (13/41) in ED. At the time when brain metastasis developed, extracrainal disease was also on progressing state in 19 patients (40.4%). The modality of up-front therapy for brain metastasis was as follows: 17 (36.1%) got GKS, 14(29.8%) re-WBRT, 7 (14.9%) up-front chemotherapy without local therapy, and 9 (19.1%) did not receive any further treatment. The median overall survival after brain metastasis was 4.9 months.

The choice of local therapy depends on factors that involve the patient (performance status, expected survival, and age), the prior treatment history, and the tumor (type and subtype, number, size, location of metastases, and extracranial disease status). Multidisciplinary collaboration is required to facilitate an individualized plan to improve the outcome of disease in patients with this life-limiting complication.

A marked increase in research over the past few decades focusing on Nrf2 and its role in regulating glioblastoma has revealed the potential value of Nrf2 in the treatment of glioblastoma. In the present review, we discuss a novel framework of Nrf2 in the regulation of glioblastoma and the mechanisms regarding the downregulation of Nrf2 in treating glioblastoma. The candidate mechanisms include direct and indirect means. Direct mechanisms target tumor molecular pathways in order to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to inhibit proliferation, to block invasion and migration, to induce apoptosis, to promote differentiation, to enhance autophagy and to target glioblastoma stem cells. Indirect mechanisms target the reaction between glioblastoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, the value of the Nrf2 pathway in glioblastoma provides a promising opportunity for new approaches by which to treat glioblastoma.",Excluded

The paper presents the results of ultrasonic investigations of the heart, arterial and venous peripheral vessels in different parts of human body, and measurements of leg veins capacity with the use of occlusive plethysmograpy. It was shown that in the resting condition such prime hemodynamic parameters as the pumping function of the heart and blood supply of the brain, and integral parameters, i.e. arterial pressure and heat rate, were best ""protected"" as they demonstrated stability throughout long exposure in microgravity. In the absence of gravitational stimulation, arterial resistance went down in essentially all vascular regions below the heart level; to put it differently, the anti-gravity distribution of the vascular tone was annulled gradually as unneeded in microgravity. Compared with the data about arteries, venous hemodynamics was found to be particularly sensitive considering the early advent and significance of changes. Venous return slowed down, resistance of the lower body vessels declined and capacity of the leg venous net increased. Functional testing with the lower body negative pressure revealed degradation of the gravity-dependent reactions that became more conspicuous as flight duration extended further. Cardiovascular deconditioning showed itself clearly on return to Earth's gravity by decreased g-tolerance during re-entry and orthostatic instability post flight.

Here, we report on the logistics as well as the first 260 cases reviewed in one year of a pilot program at a community-based multi-location network of radiation oncology facilities. Materials/Methods: We implemented a departmental process at four network radiation facilities affiliated with an academic institution that no SBRT or SRS case could be treated without a second physician approving the contours and plan prior to delivery of the first fraction. Coincident with this process, we began an SBRT/SRS peer review rounds for 30-60 minutes per week. Ideally, cases were reviewed initially for contour approval including targets, organs at risk (OAR), image registration, and overall directive/modality selection. Cases approved in this phase progressed to planning and were reviewed the following week for final peer approval. Cases with more urgent turnaround times, particularly intracranial radiosurgery, were often required to be reviewed outside of rounds by a second physician. Recommendations for changes in both the contouring/directive review phase and the planning phase were collected prospectively. Changes were designated major changes retrospectively by the physician team if the change materially altered the final plan. Result(s): From March 2019 to February 2020, 260 cases were treated with SBRT or SRS in our network. 56 cases (21.5%) had a change recommendation. 19 (7%) cases had a major revision. 95% (53 cases) of changes detected by this program were during the contouring/intent phase of planning with only 5% (3 cases) requiring revision at the planning phase or at treatment delivery. Most common deviations detected tracked closely with cases reported in the ASTRO RO-ILS system such as OAR (35%) and target revisions (18%), minor prescription adjustments (25%) and prior radiation dose not accounted for (9%). Near universal prospective peer review of stereotactic cases (99.5%) was accomplished using this system. Conclusion(s): Here, we demonstrate that prospective peer review is both feasible and results in a significant number of changes - 21.5% of cases reviewed. Major changes that materially altered the plan occurred in 19 of 260 cases (7%). This system allowed for near universal prospective peer review of these cases with no significant delay in planning or treatment with a low burden on physicians and staff of approximately 1 hour per week per physician. Prospective peer review also resulted in very few re-planned cases in the post-planning phase including plan check and changes discovered at the time of treatment delivery (1% overall).

715,"Pilot pharmacokinetic and dosimetric studies of (18)F-FPPRGD2: a PET radiopharmaceutical agent for imaging alpha(v)beta(3) integrin levels. PURPOSE: To assess the safety, biodistribution, and dosimetric properties of the positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical agent fluorine 18 ((18)F) FPPRGD2 (2-fluoropropionyl labeled PEGylated dimeric RGD peptide [PEG3-E{c(RGDyk)}2]), which is based on the dimeric arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide sequence and targets alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, in the first volunteers imaged with this tracer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Five healthy volunteers underwent whole-body combined PET-computed tomography 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after tracer injection (mean dose, 9.5 mCi +/- 3.4 [standard deviation] [351.5 MBq +/- 125.8]; mean specific radioactivity, 1200 mCi/mmol +/- 714 [44.4 GBq/mmol +/- 26.4]). During this time, standard vital signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) readings, and blood sample values (for chemistry, hematologic, and liver function tests) were checked at regular intervals and 1 and 7 days after the injection. These data were used to evaluate tracer biodistribution and dosimetric properties, time-activity curves, and the stability of laboratory values. Significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values were evaluated by using a combination of population-averaged generalized estimating equation regression and exact paired Wilcoxon tests.RESULTS: The administration of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was well tolerated, with no marked effects on vital signs, ECG readings, or laboratory values. The tracer showed the same pattern of biodistribution in all volunteers: primary clearance through the kidneys (0.360 rem/mCi +/- 0.185 [0.098 mSv/MBq +/- 0.050]) and bladder (0.862 rem/mCi +/- 0.436 [0.233 mSv/MBq +/- 0.118], voiding model) and uptake in the spleen (0.250 rem/mCi +/- 0.168 [0.068 mSv/MBq +/- 0.046]) and large intestine (0.529 rem/mCi +/- 0.236 [0.143 mSv/MBq +/- 0.064]). The mean effective dose of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was 0.1462 rem/mCi +/- 0.0669 (0.0396 mSv/MBq +/- 0.0181). With an injected dose of 10 mCi (370 MBq) and a 1-hour voiding interval, a patient would be exposed to an effective radiation dose of 1.5 rem (15 mSv). Above the diaphragm, there was minimal uptake in the brain ventricles, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. Time-activity curves showed rapid clearance from the vasculature, with a mean 26% +/- 17 of the tracer remaining in the circulation at 30 minutes and most of the activity occurring in the plasma relative to cells (mean whole blood-plasma ratio, 0.799 +/- 0.096).CONCLUSION: (18)F-FPPRGD2 has desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties. The primary application is likely to be PET evaluation of oncologic patients-especially those with brain, breast, or lung cancer. Specific indications may include tumor staging, identifying patients who would benefit from antiangiogenesis therapy, and separating treatment responders from nonresponders early.",Excluded
1439,"Machine Friendly Machine Learning: Interpretation of Computed Tomography Without Image Reconstruction. Recent advancements in deep learning for automated image processing and classification have accelerated many new applications for medical image analysis. However, most deep learning algorithms have been developed using reconstructed, human-interpretable medical images. While image reconstruction from raw sensor data is required for the creation of medical images, the reconstruction process only uses a partial representation of all the data acquired. Here, we report the development of a system to directly process raw computed tomography (CT) data in sinogram-space, bypassing the intermediary step of image reconstruction. Two classification tasks were evaluated for their feasibility of sinogram-space machine learning: body region identification and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection. Our proposed SinoNet, a convolutional neural network optimized for interpreting sinograms, performed favorably compared to conventional reconstructed image-space-based systems for both tasks, regardless of scanning geometries in terms of projections or detectors. Further, SinoNet performed significantly better when using sparsely sampled sinograms than conventional networks operating in image-space. As a result, sinogram-space algorithms could be used in field settings for triage (presence of ICH), especially where low radiation dose is desired. These findings also demonstrate another strength of deep learning where it can analyze and interpret sinograms that are virtually impossible for human experts.",Excluded

2173,"Increased seroreactivity to glioma-expressed antigen 2 in brain tumor patients under radiation. BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation. Antigens that become immunogenic with an increased antibody response as result of radiation can serve as ideal targets for immunotherapy of human tumors.",Excluded
488,"Cerebellar Liponeurocytoma with an Unusually Aggressive Clinical Course: Case Report. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Liponeurocytomas are rare cerebellar neoplasms in adults, with benign histological features and a favorable clinical prognosis. Current clinical opinion is based on a total of less than 20 published cases and suggests that gross total resection and long-term follow-up monitoring, with possible additional surgery and radiotherapy for treatment of recurrent tumors, represent the best treatment approach for this relatively benign tumor type. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presented with worsening unsteady gait and headaches, suggesting increased intracranial pressure. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent subtotal resection of a cerebellar liponeurocytoma, followed by fractionated radiotherapy (total dose of 54 Gy). She experienced a local recurrence of the tumor 12 months later and underwent additional surgery for removal of the cerebellar mass. A second recurrent tumor was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging scans 3 months later and was surgically resected. The tumor histological findings were consistently devoid of atypical features, apart from leptomeningeal invasion noted in the first surgical specimen. CONCLUSION(S): This unusual case demonstrated an atypical clinical course of a highly aggressive and radiation-resistant tumor, despite the consistent absence of aggressive histological features. Cerebellar liponeurocytomas may not be as benign as the current literature and typical low-grade cytological and histological features suggest.",Excluded

Background: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who respond to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) seem to be at increased risk of central nervous system relapse, and may benefit from prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) more than other NSCLC patients. Method(s): This study investigates the safety and efficacy of combining PCI with EGFR TKIs in stage IV NSCLC. Patients with stage IV NSCLC, no evidence of brain metastases, and an indication for first or later line therapy with an EGFR TKI will be enrolled. Those with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) following 6 weeks of therapy and no evidence of brain metastases on MRI will be treated with PCI. Neurocognitive function, depression indices, quality of life, symptoms, and ability to function independantly will be assessed at baseline, before PCI, and at 6 week and then 3 month intervals following PCI. MRI will be repeated 6 weeks following PCI and at 3 month intervals, and serum markers of blood brain barrier permeability (neuron-specific enolase (NSE), protein S100 beta) will be assessed at all visits. Safety data will be formally reviewed after the first 10 patients. The primary endpoint for efficacy is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, site of progression, quality of life and neurological disability.

2822,"Physics of surgery with lasers. The characteristics of the principal lasers used in surgery are summarized in Table 1. Their diverse effects on biologic tissues permit the following generalizations: The CO2 laser is best suited for precise, visually controllable tissue removal by vaporization with minimal marginal damage. Hemostasis is excellent for bleeding from capillary vessels, but difficult for larger ones. The Nd:YAG laser is best suited for the coagulation of larger tissue volumes of the order of 10 mm3 or more. Tissue heating inherently extends for several millimeters, leading to excellent hemostasis. Radiation from this laser is well transmitted through flexible optical fibers and clear fluids. The argon ion laser emits radiation in the visible range and is ideally suited for treating the retina and other tissues in the eye without damage to its transparent structures. Radiation of this laser is strongly absorbed by pigmented tissues, scattered and reflected by others, and transmitted by fluids. Its radiation can be focused to very small spot sizes, leading to high precision and high-power densities. It has hemostatic properties intermediate between those of the CO2 and of the Nd:YAG laser radiations. It is well transmitted through optical fibers and clear fluids. It is used extensively in ophthalmology and dermatology. Selected applications to neurosurgery and otology are being investigated. These lasers have become indispensable adjuncts to the surgical armamentarium of several specialties. The very success of these lasers is leading to a critical examination of their shortcomings and to a search for improved systems. Examples are (1) the ongoing search for optical fibers to transmit the radiation of the CO2 laser; (2) the development of systems for the sequential delivery to tissues of several wavelengths from a single unit (Fig. 14); and (3) investigations of tissue effects of laser beams in the ultraviolet and in the infrared at wavelengths intermediate between those of the Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers. The use of lasers has already contributed to improved medical care in many surgical disciplines. Additional areas of application can be confidently anticipated.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to determine the responses of the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons to stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SSC). We hypothesized that direct stimulation of the SSC will inhibit the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons by activating the descending inhibitory system. Thirty-four wide dynamic range spinal dorsal horn neurons were recorded in response to graded mechanical stimulation (brush, pressure, and pinch) at their respective receptive fields while a stepwise electrical stimulation (300 Hz, 0.1 ms, at 10, 20, and 30 V) was applied in the SSC through a bipolar tungsten electrode. The responses to brush at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 16.0 +/- 2.3, 15.8 +/- 2.2, 14.6 +/- 1.8, 14.8 +/- 2.0, and 17.0 +/- 2.2 spikes/s, respectively. The responses to pressure at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 44.7 +/- 5.5, 37.0 +/- 5.6, 29.5 +/- 4.8, 31.6 +/- 5.2, and 43.2 +/- 5.7 spikes/s, respectively. The responses to pinch at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 58.1 +/- 7.0, 42.9 +/- 5.5, 34.8 +/- 3.9, 34.6 +/- 4.4, and 52.6 +/- 6.0 spikes/s, respectively. Significant decreases of the dorsal horn neuronal responses to pressure and pinch were observed during SSC stimulation.

The purpose of the study was to reveal parts of the body affected by radiation most of all in uneven microwave irradiation (current frequency of 2.4 GHz/s) by the destruction criterion taking account of some indicators of the absorbed power of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Uneven irradiation was achieved by the screening of some parts of the body with radiopaque material leaving unshielded parts subjected to irradiation. Control over the redistribution of absorbed energy was exercised by means of multichamber phantoms. In experiments on animals (female rats) within the range of specific absorbed power of 15-40 mWg the utmost affection of the cranial segment was revealed. The results show good correlation with a curve of the effect of 50% destruction criterion in total EMR irradiation.,Excluded

55,"Processing of modulated sounds in the zebra finch auditory midbrain: responses to noise, frequency sweeps, and sinusoidal amplitude modulations. The avian auditory midbrain nucleus, the mesencephalicus lateralis, dorsalis (MLd), is the first auditory processing stage in which multiple parallel inputs converge, and it provides the input to the auditory thalamus. We studied the responses of single MLd neurons to four types of modulated sounds: 1) white noise; 2) band-limited noise; 3) frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and 4) sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones (SAM) in adult male zebra finches. Responses were compared with the responses of the same neurons to pure tones in terms of temporal response patterns, thresholds, characteristic frequencies, frequency tuning bandwidths, tuning sharpness, and spike rate/intensity relationships. Most neurons responded well to noise. More than one-half of the neurons responded selectively to particular portions of the noise, suggesting that, unlike forebrain neurons, many MLd neurons can encode specific acoustic components of highly modulated sounds such as noise. Selectivity for FM sweep direction was found in only 13% of cells that responded to sweeps. Those cells also showed asymmetric tuning curves, suggesting that asymmetric inhibition plays a role in FM directional selectivity. Responses to SAM showed that MLd neurons code temporal modulation rates using both spike rate and synchronization. Nearly all cells showed low-pass or band-pass filtering properties for SAM. Best modulation frequencies matched the temporal modulations in zebra finch song. Results suggest that auditory midbrain neurons are well suited for encoding a wide range of complex sounds with a high degree of temporal accuracy rather than selectively responding to only some sounds.",Excluded
260,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro. Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K+ conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow after hyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (5 microM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow after hyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca(2+)-spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow after hyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded

103,"Metabolic therapy reduces expression of PECAM-1/CD31 and decreases peritumoral edema in a mouse model of malignant glioma. Patients with malignant brain tumors have a median survival of approximately one year following diagnosis, regardless of currently available treatments which include surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Improvement in the survival of brain cancer patients requires the design of new therapeutic modalities that take advantage of common phenotypes. One such phenotype is the metabolic dysregulation that is a hallmark of cancer cells. It has therefore been postulated that one approach to treating brain tumors may be by metabolic alteration such as that which occurs through the use of the ketogenic diet (KD). The KD is high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that induces ketosis and has been utilized for the non-pharmacologic treatment of refractory epilepsy. We and others have shown that this diet enhances survival and potentiates standard therapy in mouse models of malignant gliomas, yet the anti-tumor mechanisms are not fully understood. It has been previously shown that caloric restriction, which induces ketosis, reduces microvessel density in mouse and human brain tumor models, suggesting an anti-angiogenic effect. We now report that in animals fed KetoCal (KC) (4:1 fat:protein/carbohydrates) ad libitum, peritumoral edema is significantly reduced early in tumor progression when compared to those fed a standard rodent diet (SD). Western blot analysis showed a reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1/CD31) in tumors from animals maintained on KC. These results were supported by immunohistochemical staining for CD31 which also revealed abnormal vessel structure in the tumors from animals fed SD but not in those fed KC, suggesting a normalizing effect by the KC. Furthermore gene expression profiling demonstrated that KC decreases expression of a group of genes involved in angiogenesis and vessel structuring including the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) and angiopoetin 1 receptor (TEK), integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP1). Taken together our data suggests that KC alters the angiogenic processes involved in malignant progression of gliomas. A greater understanding of the effects of the ketogenic diet as an adjuvant therapy will allow for a more rational approach to its clinical use.",Excluded

Aim(s): We asked whether a similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter thalamic nuclei as an effect of intrathecal/subependymal inflammation. Method(s): We examined dorsomedial thalamic nuclei tissues and paired CSF samples from 41 post-mortem secondary progressive MS (SPMS) cases, counting MHC-classII+ microglia/ macrophages and NeuN+ neurons in 10 SPMS cases with meningeal tertiary- lymphoid-like structures(TLS+), 10 SPMS cases without meningeal TLS(TLS-) and 5 controls. Result(s): Thalamic demyelination was observed in 90% of cases, and active lesions in 40%. MS cases exhibited significant reduction in NeuN+ neuronal density compared to controls, and this damage exhibited a CSForiented gradient, greatest (26%) in subventricular locations with respect to 12% at 10 mm from the ependyma/ CSF boundary. The gradient was reversed for MHC-II+ microglia density, which was increased by over 50% at 2 mm from the ventricular surface vs 15% at 10 mm. Most of the periventricular MHC-II+ cells (70%) expressed the resident-homeostatic marker TMEM119.

23,"Patterns of Failure after Stereotactic Radiosurgery of the Resection Cavity Following Surgical Removal of Brain Metastases. BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT) is considered standard treatment for BM. However, exposing large volumes of normal brain tissue to irradiation can cause neurotoxicity. This study describes our experience with 100 consecutive patients with brain metastases who were managed with surgical extirpation followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity.METHODS: Patients with 1-3 brain metastases (BM), who underwent resection of 1-2 BM between June 2005 and December 2013, were treated with SRS directed to the tumor cavity and for any synchronous BM. Local and distant treatment failures were determined based on neuroimaging. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for local and distant failure rates and overall survival.RESULTS: One hundred and two resection cavities were treated with SRS in 100 consecutive patients. Thirty-two additional synchronous metastases were treated in 27 patients during the same session. The median overall survival was 18.9 months. Local control rate at 1 year was 84%. Longer delays between surgery and SRS were associated with increased risk of local failure (hazard ratio, -1.46; P = 0.02). Distant progression occurred in 44% of the patients at a mean of 8.8 +/- 6.6 months after SRS treatment. Ten cases of leptomeningeal spread occurred around the resection cavities (9.8%). Central nervous system failure was not significantly associated with survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that recursive partitioning analysis and active systemic disease were significantly associated with survival.CONCLUSION: The strategy described provides acceptable local disease control when compared with WBRT following surgery. This approach can delay and even annul WBRT in the majority of selected BM patients, especially recursive partitioning analysis class I patients.

1583,"Temperature dependence of radiation-induced DNA-protein crosslinks formed under hypoxic conditions. Recently, we demonstrated that the oxygen dependence of the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in irradiated mammalian cells measured by the alkaline elution technique is the mirror image of the oxygen dependence of radiation-induced cell killing. Consequently, these radiation-induced DPCs could be used to detect hypoxic cells or estimate the hypoxic fraction of cells in solid tumors. Although several techniques, including alkaline elution, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nitrocellulose filter binding, have been used to measure radiation-induced DPCs, the published reports suggest that the characteristics of these DPCs may depend on both the type of sample irradiated (cellular compared to model systems, oxygenated compared to hypoxic, etc.) and the technique used to measure these radiation-induced DPCs. In the present study, the radiation-induced DPCs measured by our alkaline elution technique with and without proteinase K in the lysis solution were characterized by studying the dependence of their formation on temperature in hypoxic rat 9L brain tumor cells. Exponentially growing 9L rat brain tumor cells were rendered hypoxic at 4degreeC or at 37degreeC and then irradiated with either 7.5 Gy or 15 Gy. The cells were trypsinized at 4degreeC, either immediately after the irradiation or after one half-time of strand break repair at 37degreeC. The results demonstrated that the radiation- induced DPCs produced in 9L cells under hypoxic conditions, measured by our alkaline elution technique after low to moderate radiation doses, required metabolism for their formation, unlike the radiation-induced DPCs reported by others using the GC/MS or nitrocellulose filter binding technique.",Excluded

2093,"Space motion sickness: incidence, etiology, and countermeasures. Space motion sickness is experienced by 60% to 80% of space travelers during their first 2 to 3 days in microgravity and by a similar proportion during their first few days after return to Earth. Space motion sickness symptoms are similar to those in other forms of motion sickness; they include: pallor, increased body warmth, cold sweating, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and anorexia. These are important because they may affect the operational performance of astronauts. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain space motion sickness: the fluid shift hypothesis and the sensory conflict hypothesis. The fluid shift hypothesis suggests that space motion sickness results from the cranial shifting of body fluids resulting from the loss of hydrostatic pressure gradients in the lower body when entering microgravity. The cranial fluid shifts lead to visible puffiness in the face, and are thought to increase the intracranial pressure, the cerebrospinal-fluid pressure or the inner ear fluid pressures, altering the response properties of the vestibular receptors and inducing space motion sickness. The sensory conflict hypothesis suggests that loss of tilt-related otolith signals upon entry into microgravity causes a conflict between actual and anticipated signals from sense organs subserving spatial orientation. Such sensory conflicts are thought to induce motion sickness in other environments. Space motion sickness is usually treated using pharmaceuticals, most of which have undesirable side effects. Further studies elucidating the underlying mechanism for space motion sickness may be required for developing new treatments. [References: 19]",Excluded
1837,"Comparing survival predicted by the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) to actual survival in patients with 1-10 brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple prognostic models for predicting survival after treatment for brain metastases have been developed. One of them, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA), has been developed to predict the median survival for brain metastases from the most frequent primary sites: lung carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal tumours. In this study we aim to compare the survival predicted by the DS-GPA to actual survival, and to assess this models performance on both population and individual levels.METHODS: We identified a consecutive cohort of patients treated with SRS for brain metastases in our institute. DS-GPA scores were calculated for each patient, and the median survival for each DS-GPA group was calculated. Differences in survival between DS-GPA groups were tested with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and log-rank tests.RESULTS: In total 367 patients were included in the analysis. Median survival in our cohort is largely comparable to corresponding DS-GPA cohorts, but some notable differences are present. There was a significantly shorter median survival (15.4months, compared to 26.5months) in the adenocarcinoma NSCLC subgroup with a GPA score of 2.3-3. We confirmed the significant differences in survival time for most cancer-specific subgroups.CONCLUSION: DS-GPA seems to be a reliable tool to classify patients with brain metastases treated with SRS into prognostic subgroups. However, we found some aberrations from predicted median survival times, which may be due to specific characteristics of the populations of patients treated with SRS versus other patients.",Excluded

BACKGROUND/AIM: The anticipation of radiotherapy can cause distress and sleep disorders, which may be aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated sleep disorders in a large cohort of patients with breast cancer before and during the pandemic.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three characteristics were retrospectively analyzed for associations with pre-radiotherapy sleep disorders in 338 patients. Moreover, 163 patients presenting before and 175 patients presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared for sleep disorders.RESULTS: Sleep disorders were significantly associated with age <=60 years (p=0.006); high distress score (p<0.0001); more emotional (p<0.0001), physical (p<0.0001) or practical (p<0.0001) problems; psycho-oncological need (p<0.0001); invasive cancer (p=0.003); chemotherapy (p<0.001); and hormonal therapy (p=0.006). Sleep disorders were similarly common in both groups (prior to vs. during the pandemic: 40% vs. 45%, p=0.38).CONCLUSION: Although additional significant risk factors for sleep disorders were identified, the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to have no significant impact on sleep disorders in patients scheduled for irradiation of breast cancer.",Excluded

Bleomycin, a radiomimetic glycopeptide, inhibits de novo DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia lymphoblastoid B cells to a markedly lesser extent than in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum lymphoid cells. This observation is similar to that following ionizing radiation; however, the effect is slower following the chemical treatment. Recovery of the normal cells occurs 15-18 hours after treatment, whereas the ataxia telangiectasia lines do not attain normal levels of DNA synthesis during the entire 24-hour observation period. Similar differences were not observed following treatment with mitomycin C, a bifunctional alkylating agent, indicating a specific effect of bleomycin on DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia cells.

Light-induced release of progonadal hormones involves a complex cascade of responses both inside and outside the brain. In this study, we used induction of early growth response 1 (Egr-1), the protein product of an immediate early gene, to evaluate the time course of such responses in male white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) exposed to a single long day. Induction of Egr-1 in the pars tuberalis began ~11h after dawn. This response was followed ~6h later by dramatic induction in the tuberal hypothalamus, including in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. At approximately the same time, Egr-1 was induced in dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus and in dopaminergic neurons of the premammillary nucleus. We noted no induction in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons until 2h after dawn the following morning. Overall, our results indicate that Egr-1 responses in GnRH neurons occur rather late during photostimulation, compared with responses in other cell populations, and that such induction may reflect new synthesis related to GnRH depletion rather than stimulation by light cues.",Excluded
1538,"Conventional radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide for malignant gliomas. High grade malignant gliomas are among the most radioresistant human tumors and total doses up to 80 Gy are inadequate to achieve long-term local control in most of the patients. Hypoxia has been demonstrated in primary brain tumors and may be one of the reasons for their radioresistance. In experimental models carbogen breathing and nicotinamide have been shown to act against hypoxia by different mechanisms and both modalities were tested in 16 patients with supratentorial malignant gliomas in combination with a conventional radiotherapy scheme (50 Gy in 25 daily fractions). The present study was performed to determine the feasibility and toxicity of conventional radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide.

251,"A novel high-resolution in vivo imaging technique to study the dynamic response of intracranial structures to tumor growth and therapeutics. We have successfully integrated previously established Intracranial window (ICW) technology (1-4) with intravital 2-photon confocal microscopy to develop a novel platform that allows for direct long-term visualization of tissue structure changes intracranially. Imaging at a single cell resolution in a real-time fashion provides supplementary dynamic information beyond that provided by standard end-point histological analysis, which looks solely at 'snap-shot' cross sections of tissue. Establishing this intravital imaging technique in fluorescent chimeric mice, we are able to image four fluorescent channels simultaneously. By incorporating fluorescently labeled cells, such as GFP+ bone marrow, it is possible to track the fate of these cells studying their long-term migration, integration and differentiation within tissue. Further integration of a secondary reporter cell, such as an mCherry glioma tumor line, allows for characterization of cell:cell interactions. Structural changes in the tissue microenvironment can be highlighted through the addition of intra-vital dyes and antibodies, for example CD31 tagged antibodies and Dextran molecules. Moreover, we describe the combination of our ICW imaging model with a small animal micro-irradiator that provides stereotactic irradiation, creating a platform through which the dynamic tissue changes that occur following the administration of ionizing irradiation can be assessed. Current limitations of our model include penetrance of the microscope, which is limited to a depth of up to 900 mum from the sub cortical surface, limiting imaging to the dorsal axis of the brain. The presence of the skull bone makes the ICW a more challenging technical procedure, compared to the more established and utilized chamber models currently used to study mammary tissue and fat pads (5-7). In addition, the ICW provides many challenges when optimizing the imaging.",Excluded

The volumes of the surgical cavity on computed tomography (CT) obtained one day after GTR (CT0), the first RT simulation CT (sim-CT1), and the second simulation CT for the boost RT plan (sim-CT2) were compared. The boost RT plan was based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT2 (boost RTP2) and was compared with that based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT1 (boost RTP1). The volume reduction ratios were 14.4%-51.3% (median, 29.0%) between CT0 and sim-CT1 and -7.9%-71.9% (median, 34.9%) between sim-CT1 and sim-CT2 (P < 0.001).

The link between many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the aberrant folding and aggregation of proteins has prompted a comprehensive search for small organic molecules that have the potential to inhibit such processes. Although many compounds have been reported to affect the formation of amyloid fibrils and/or other types of protein aggregates, the mechanisms by which they act are not well understood. A large number of compounds appear to act in a nonspecific way affecting several different amyloidogenic proteins. We describe here a detailed study of the mechanism of action of one representative compound, lacmoid, in the context of the inhibition of the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show that lacmoid binds Abeta(1-40) in a surfactant-like manner and counteracts the formation of all types of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates. On the basis of these and previous findings, we are able to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of action of nonspecific modulators of protein self-assembly in terms of hydrophobic attraction and the conformational preferences of the polypeptide.",Excluded
3531,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors enable two distinct forms of long-term depression in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo. The existence of long-term depression (LTD) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats, as well as the contribution of different types of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to this form of plasticity, has been the subject of much debate. Here, we describe two distinct forms of mGluR-dependent hippocampal LTD in the dentate gyrus of freely moving adult rats. LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of the medial perforant path (LFS-LTD), was prevented by antagonism of the phospholipase C-coupled receptors, mGluR1 but not mGluR5. Chemical LTD, induced by intracerebral application of the group I mGluR agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, was blocked by antagonism of both mGluR5 and mGluR1. Selective activation of mGluR5, using (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), also led to chemical LTD. To test whether LFS-LTD and chemical LTD share common induction mechanisms, we applied LFS following the induction of chemical LTD by CHPG (CHPG-LTD). Surprisingly, LFS impaired CHPG-LTD. Further analysis revealed that induction of CHPG-LTD led to altered calcium dynamics sufficient for its reversal by LFS. We found that LTD induced by (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, but not by CHPG, is impaired by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism. Both forms of chemical LTD strongly require calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This contrasts with previous findings that LFS-LTD in the dentate gyrus is both N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and voltage-gated calcium channel independent. LFS-LTD and LTD induced by group I mGluR agonists thus appear to comprise distinct forms of LTD that require the activation of specific group I mGluRs and recruit calcium from different sources.",Excluded
3501,"Automated image enhancement (clarityiq) to reduce radiation dosage without loss of image quality. Background: Excess radiation exposure is related with adverse events. Therefore the allowed radiation dosage for healthcare workers is regulated by governing agencies. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle still applies. ClarityIQ is an automated algorithm developed to reduce the radiation dosage used without loss of image quality. Method(s): Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure). Images were reviewed by three independent reviewers and scored on subjective image quality, good, fair, poor. Result(s): Our preliminary data demonstrate that 47 patients (mean age 62.8 +/- 11.1) were enrolled with a mean BMI of 26.6 kg/m2 +/- 3.7. All had normal kidney function (MDRD > 60) and no known previous myocardial infarction of the LCA. The image quality of the ClarityIQ images was of adequate diagnostic quality in all patients as assessed by the operator. Independent reviewers assessed the images as good in 29, fair in 18 and poor in none. Reduction in mean DAP was 58%, mean DAP of ClarityIQ was 1126 mGy.cm2 and 1955 mGy.cm2 for the standard image acquisition. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm, adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 58% of radiation dose. Thus resulting in less stochastic effects of radiation for the cath-lab personnel and also less deterministic effects for the patient. Further research is needed to assess whether ClarityIQ is also suitable for large patients and different angulations.",Excluded

Modifications are described for an innovative and widely used high-performance liquid chromatography technique that resolves a very broad spectrum of lipids for quantitation by evaporative light-scattering detection. Substitution of acetone for 2-propanol in a portion of the solvent gradient program yields consistent resolution of diacylglycerol and cholesterol without sacrificing baseline resolution of the remaining major lipid classes. Moreover, previously noted instabilities in triacylglycerol retention time are eliminated. The introduction of acetone also enables a 20% reduction in flow-rate without an increase in total run time. As a further modification of the mobile phase composition, acetic acid and ethanolamine are substituted for the serine-ethylamine combination that was originally shown to improve column performance. The combination of acetic acid and ethanolamine yields the same result but the increased volatility of these solutes over serine results in decreased baseline noise.

Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has traditionally been refractory to radiotherapy with conventional fractionation, although recent evidence suggests a response to higher doses per fraction. We evaluated local control of extra-cranial metastases from RCC treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Method(s): RCC patients with extracranial metastases treated with SABR were retrospectively enrolled from a single institution between 2005 and 2015. A total of 188 lesions were identified from 91 patients. Radiation (8-60Gy) was delivered in 1-5 fractions (fx) using stereotactic guidance. Local control (LC) was determined by imaging according to RECIST 1.1. Result(s): Median age at the time of treatment was 62.4 years. Metastases were detected in bone (39.9%), lung (14.9%), liver (9.6%), lymph nodes (11.7%) and other sites (23.9%). Ninety-seven (51.6%) lesions reached curative intent while 91 (48.4%) only reached palliative intent. The most common radiation regimens were 20Gy/1fx, 30Gy/3fx, and 40Gy/5fx. One-year overall survival was 76.5% with a median follow up of 10.7 months. Patients treated with curative SABR showed a 2-fold median survival as compared to those treated with palliative therapy (3.97 year vs 1.43 year, p<0.05). LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 91.4% and 89.7%, respectively. For the patients that failed, median time to local failure was 6.6 months. LC at 1 year significantly improved when treatment was curative (96.1% vs 84.9%, p<0.05), while it decreased in a re-irradiation setting (94.8% vs 46.7%, p<0.05). The median biological equivalent dose (BED) for the lesions that failed was 103Gy, corresponding to 6Gy x 5fx, and was significantly lowered compared to controlled lesions (BED 134Gy). Although 79% of patients developed new lesions within 1 year following SABR, 34.8% did not switch systemic therapy. Switching systemic therapy was delayed in patients treated with curative as compared to palliative SABR (13.4 vs 2.5 months, p<0.05).

The herpes simplex virus-1 deletion mutant HSV1716 is a conditionally- replicating oncolytic virus. The safety of HSV1716 has been demonstrated in phase 1 clinical trails with no toxicity attributable to the virus in any patients and provided proof of principle that the virus is capable of directly destroying human tumour cells while leaving normal cells intact (1).

Purpose/Objective(s): Currently, there is no consensus fractionation scheme for spine SBRT. We report mature outcomes for a cohort of patients with no prior radiation (de novo) treated with 24 Gy in 2 daily fractions, which represents an emerging Canadian standard. Purpose/Objective(s): The cohort consisted of 279 de novo spinal metastases in 145 consecutive patients treated with 24 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions, between 2009 and 2015, identified from a prospective database. All vertebral segments were treated with an institutionally standardized Linac-based approach using cone-beam CT image guidance and six degrees-of-freedom online setup correction. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and the rate of vertebral compression fractures (VCF). OS rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier methods and cumulative incidences of LC and VCF were obtained from competing risk analysis using death as a competing risk event. Evaluation of tumor control was based on serial spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per the SPIne response assessment in Neuro-Oncology (SPINO) criteria recommendations. Result(s): The median follow-up was 17.0 months (range, 0.1-71.6 months). The 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 73.1% and 60.7%, respectively.

The 1-year and 2-year LC rates were 90.3% and 82.4%, respectively, and the median time to local failure (LF) was 9.2 month (range, 0.4-31.3 months). Only the presence of epidural disease predicted for LF (P < 0.0001). The cumulative risk of VCF at 1 and 2 years were 8.5% and 13.8%, respectively.

Lymphocytopenia is one of the main toxicities of radiotherapy and its severity is related to the irradiation dose. The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number. Therefore, evidence of brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded

DNA from the colon cancer cells was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The patient had a germline-inactivating p53 mutation, confirming the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). The colon tumor and the lung tumor both conserved the mutant p53 allele but had lost the wild-type allele. This observation and the experimental data suggest an abnormal sensitivity of LFS patients to radiogenic carcinogenesis. The indications and extent of radiotherapy in patients with a clinical or molecular diagnosis of LFS should be discussed individually and should take into account the risk of secondary neoplasms arising in the radiation fields.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To investigate technical feasibilities of noncoplanar proton-beam therapy (PBT) on dose reduction to critical organs.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The degree of mechanical precision, rotational limitations of the gantry and the treatment couch were evaluated, and dose-volume histograms were compared for noncoplanar and coplanar PBT. Following these studies, three patients with tumors proximal to the optic nerve underwent noncoplanar PBT.RESULTS: Noncoplanar PBT offered advantage in dose reduction to the optic nerve when compared to coplanar therapy. This advantage was more significant if the tumor reduced in size during treatment. None experienced radiation injury to the optic nerve during a short follow-up time of 7-12 months.CONCLUSION: Noncoplanar PBT appears to reduce doses to organs at risk.",Excluded
3237,"Structural and enzymatic aspects of rhodopsin phosphorylation. Photoactivated rhodopsin (Rho*) is phosphorylated near the C terminus at multiple sites, predominantly at Ser334, Ser338, and Ser343. We systematically examined the sites of phosphorylation upon flash activation of Rho in rod outer segment (ROS) homogenates. Addition of an inhibitory antibody against rhodopsin kinase (RK) lowered phosphorylation at Ser334, Ser338, and Ser343, without changing the ratio between phosphorylation sites. In contrast, no effect of protein kinase C was detected after stimulation (by a phorbol ester), inhibition (with H7), or reconstitution of protein kinase C with purified ROS membranes. The stoichiometry and the ratio between different phosphorylation sites in purified Rho were also reproduced using RK, purified to apparent homogeneity from ROS or from an insect cell expression system. Thus, we conclude that light-dependent phosphorylation of Rho is mediated primarily by RK. Depalmitoylation of Rho at Cys322 and Cys323 altered the conformation of the C terminus of Rho, as observed by phosphorylation by casein kinase I, but did not affect phosphorylation by RK. The sites of phosphorylation were influenced, however, by the presence of four conserved amino acids at the C terminus of Rho. The accumulation of phosphorylated Ser334 observed in vivo could result from slower dephosphorylation of this site as compared with dephosphorylation of Ser338 and Ser343. These data provide a molecular mechanism for the site-specific phosphorylation of Rho observed in vivo.",Excluded
335,"The effects of PDT in primary malignant brain tumours could be improved by intraoperative radiotherapy. INTRODUCTION: GBM has a poor survival despite surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Cytoreduction and PDT have postulated to afford better local GBM-control. However, the interaction of PDT with newer novel therapies had not been fully investigated. This study reviewed the impact of PDT in conjunction with intraoperative radiotherapy.METHODS: Case note review of prospectively collected data of GBMs treated surgically by the senior author (SE). Patients received standard therapy (ST), ST+PDT or ST+PDT+IORT. ST involved maximum safe resection, PDT involved intracavity 100 J/cm2 630 nm laser and IORT involved intracavity 10-15 Gys using the PRS400 R. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically till death.RESULTS: There were 73 patients included in this analysis (42 males). The average age was 59years. Thirty received PDT and 43 did not. The mean survival of PDT-patients was significantly longer than those had ST alone (62.9 weeks vs. 20.6 weeks) (p=0.001). Patients < 65 year of age survived longer than those >= 65 year (p=0.033). IORT on its own did not make a significant difference to survival (p=0.111). However the average survival for patients who received PDT+IORT was substantially higher than those who received PDT alone (79 weeks vs. 39.7 weeks). Using a Cox regression covariant analysis, demonstrated that PDT was the only therapy to make a statistically significant difference to survival (p=0.018).CONCLUSIONS: PDT in high grade glioma was statistically significant therapeutic modality and its effects were further improved by IORT.",Excluded

This study evaluated the potential of iron oxide nanoparticle-loaded human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived spherical neural masses (SNMs) to improve the transportation of stem cells to the brain, ameliorate brain damage from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and recover the functional status after ICH under an external magnetic field of a magnet attached to a helmet. At 24 h after induction of ICH, rats were randomly separated into three experimental groups: ICH with injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS group), ICH with intravenous injection of magnetosome-like ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes (FION)-labeled SNMs (SNMs* group), and ICH with intravenous injection of FION-labeled SNMs followed by three days of external magnetic field exposure for targeted delivery by a magnet-embedded helmet (SNMs*+Helmet group). On day 3 after ICH induction, an increased Prussian blue-stained area and decreased swelling volume were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the other groups. A significantly decreased recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by improved neurological function three days after ICH were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group. Hemispheric atrophy at six weeks after ICH was significantly decreased in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the PBS group. In conclusion, we have developed a targeted delivery system using FION tagged to stem cells and a magnet-embedded helmet. The targeted delivery of SNMs might have the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ICH.",Excluded
1434,"Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation for the treatment of advanced-stage endometrial cancer. Introduction Ccombination chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used for adjuvant treatment of stage III-IV endometrial cancer. The goal of this study was to review the treatment duration, toxicity, and survival for patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Methods Women with stage III-IV endometrial cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation between 2006 and 2013 were included. Toxicities were classified per CTCAE v3.0 and RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify treatment and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Results Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 (range 33-85). Thirty-six patients (70.6%) had endometrioid histology, 13 patients (25.5%) had serous, clear cell, or mixed histology, and 2 women (3.9%) had carcinosarcoma. Forty-eight patients had stage III disease and three patients were stage IVB. Mean treatment duration was 107 +/- 19 days. Forty-two patients received all planned chemotherapy, and 16 patients required a dose reduction. Thirty-four patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, the majority of which were hematologic. There were no deaths related to therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received leukocyte growth factors, and 25% of patients received a blood transfusion. Seven late grade 3-4 complications occurred: four gastrointestinal and two genitourinary, and one patient had ongoing neuropathy. Median progression-free survival was 42.8 months (range 4.4-81.5 months) and median overall survival was 44.9 months (range 5.1-82.6 months). Three-year overall survival was 80%.

821,"An attempt to influence DNA content in postmitotic Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Feulgen-DNA content has been measured cytophotometrically in granule and Purkinje cells of the rat and mouse cerebellum. The study has confirmed that under normal conditions a very small part of the P. cell population in rats (less than 3%) possesses a Feulgen-DNA surplus ranging from 2C to 4C. In mice, the hyperdiploid (H2C) P. cells are even more rare. The occurrence of H2C-P. cells in rats and probably also in mice has not been substantially changed in animals exposed to factors interfering with chromatin structure and/or its template activity; the H2C-P. cells seem to be slightly more frequent after injecting mice with corticoids (Urbason) or in animals suffering from ectromelia or hereditary Purkinje cell degeneration. The incidence of H2C-P. cells has neither been substantially affected by experimental conditions which are known to lead to functional and/or metabolic stimulation of the cerebellum. Functional changes in the number of H2C-P. cell nuclei may, however, be short-term or transient in character and therefore might have excaped detection in our models.

The functions of the diverse retinal ganglion cell types in primates and the parallel visual pathways they initiate remain poorly understood. Here, unusual physiological and computational properties of the ON and OFF smooth monostratified ganglion cells are explored. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings from 48 macaque retinas revealed that these cells exhibit irregular receptive field structure composed of spatially segregated hotspots, quite different from the classic center-surround model of retinal receptive fields. Surprisingly, visual stimulation of different hotspots in the same cell produced spikes with subtly different spatiotemporal voltage signatures, consistent with a dendritic contribution to hotspot structure. Targeted visual stimulation and computational inference demonstrated strong nonlinear subunit properties associated with each hotspot, supporting a model in which the hotspots apply nonlinearities at a larger spatial scale than bipolar cells. These findings reveal a previously unreported nonlinear mechanism in the output of the primate retina that contributes to signaling spatial information.",Excluded

Over the last two decades enormous advances in this area have been made allowing noninvasive evaluation of the orbit and brain. The idea of using nuclear magnetic resonance technology to produce images rather than the ionizing radiation of computed tomography (CT) began to emerge clinically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although the quality of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was not much better than CT images, by the early 1990s, it became obvious that MRI had particular strength in identifying lesions in the posterior fossa, and demyelinating plaques. With advances in magnetic strength, computer software, surface coils, contrast medium, and more attention to the basic physics of magnet technology, the clarity of MR images improved dramatically. Recent advances in CT scanning (spiral and three-dimensional CT) and MRI (functional MRI and cine MRI) continue to affect significant changes in the discipline of neuro-ophthalmology. Furthermore, advances in MR angiography promise to allow excellent and noninvasive analysis of the cerebral vasculature. This review highlights the recent advances in neuro-imaging.

However, in a number of previous papers in the literature on applications of this equation, the term (R) expressing the 'External Radiotherapy effect' was incorrectly derived. In this note we derive an analytical expression for this term in the correct form to be included in the reaction-diffusion equation.METHODS: The R term has been derived starting from the Linear-Quadratic theory of cell killing by ionizing radiation. The correct definition of R was adopted and the basic principles of differential calculus applied.RESULTS: The compatibility of the R term derived here with the reaction-diffusion equation was demonstrated.

Absorbed radiation doses to the spinal cord and nerve roots were calculated for each radioactive DTPA compound, employing appropriate cylindrical geometry and reduction coeffients for the dose contributions from the electrons of each radionuclide. Doses are maximal at the surface and decrease rapidly with distance from the surface.

2306,"Electromagnetic field exposure and health among RF plastic sealer operators. Operators of RF plastic sealers (RF operators) are an occupational category highly exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. The aim of the present study was to make an appropriate exposure assessment of RF welding and examine the health status of the operators. In total, 35 RF operators and 37 controls were included. The leakage fields (electric and magnetic field strength) were measured, as well as induced and contact current. Information about welding time and productivity was used to calculate time integrated exposure. A neurophysiological examination and 24 h ECG were also carried out. The participants also had to answer a questionnaire about subjective symptoms. The measurements showed that RF operators were exposed to rather intense electric and magnetic fields. The mean values of the calculated 6 min, spatially averaged E and H field strengths, in line with ICNIRP reference levels, are 107 V/m and 0.24 A/m, respectively. The maximum measured field strengths were 2 kV/m and 1.5 A/m, respectively. The induced current in ankles and wrists varied, depending on the work situation, with a mean value of 101 mA and a maximum measured value of 1 A. In total, 11 out of 46 measured RF plastic sealers exceeded the ICNIRP reference levels. RF operators, especially the ready made clothing workers had a slightly disturbed two-point discrimination ability compared to a control group. A nonsignificant difference between RF operators and controls was found in the prevalence of subjective symptoms, but the time integrated exposure parameters seem to be of importance to the prevalence of some subjective symptoms: fatigue, headaches, and warmth sensations in the hands.

3058,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies. Purpose/Objective(s): In this study, we present our experience with robotic radiosurgical SBRT for patients with primary gynecologic malignancies who have experienced either local, regional, or distant metastases after primary treatment and for those patients where SBRT was used as a boost if brachytherapy was not possible. Materials/Methods: Patients treated with SBRT from June 2007 to November 2011 for metastases from primary gynecologic cancers (n=18) or as a boost when brachytherapy was not possible (n=3) with at least 6 months follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. The PTV included a 0.0 - 5.0 mm margin, depending on normal tissue proximity. For tumors where respiratory motion was present and bony anatomy could not be used for motion tracking, 1 to 3 gold fiducial markers were used. Extra-cranial body treatments to tumors, particularly lymph nodes, near the spine were tracked using the Xsight Spine Tracking System or, if fiducials were placed the Synchrony Tracking System was used. PET/ CT (preferred), CT or MRI imaging was used to assess local control after SBRT. Result(s): Twenty-one patients with 28 tumors received a median SBRT dose of 30 Gy (range, 12-60 Gy) delivered in a median of 5 fractions (range, 1-5). Median patient age was 62 years (range, 46-86 years). Primary tumor sites were cervical (42%), uterine (54%), and ovarian (4%). Tumor locations were 32% paraortic (PA), 11% pelvic sidewall (PS) and 11% central pelvic (CP) or 46% distant (DM). Distant metastases included bone (n=5), lymph nodes-not PA (n=4), lung (n=2) and brain (n=2). Most (62%) patients received chemotherapy prior to SBRT and 50% had prior radiation to the SBRT target site, most commonly external beam radiation delivered to the pelvis or paraortic region. Sixteen (76%) of patients remain alive with a median 21 months follow-up (range, 8 to 41 months) from time of SBRT. The actuarial 2-year survival rate from SBRT is 70%. Local failures occurred in 7 tumors at a median 9 months (range, 4 to 13 months) after SBRT resulting in a 2-year actuarial local control rate of 71%. The median duration of local control was 19 months (range, 8-41). No significant difference was found in local control rates between DM, PA, PS and CP tumors (p=0.6). Toxicities were limited with only 1 grade 3 (proctitis). Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgical SBRT is an attractive radiation option for gynecologic malignancies with limited metastatic disease, paraortic or pelvic recurrence.

The avian pineal gland is a photoreceptive organ that has been shown to contain postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors that inhibit melatonin synthesis and/or release upon receptor activation. Physiological response and [32P]ADP ribosylation experiments were performed to investigate whether pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) were involved in the transduction of the alpha 2-adrenergic signal. For physiological response studies, the effects of pertussis toxin on melatonin release in dissociated cell cultures exposed to norepinephrine were assessed. Pertussis toxin blocked alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin-induced blockade appeared to be noncompetitive. One and 10 ng/ml doses of pertussis toxin partially blocked and a 100 ng/ml dose completely blocked norepinephrine-induced inhibition. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of G-proteins in chick pineal cell membranes was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Membranes were prepared from cells that had been pretreated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. In the absence of pertussis toxin pretreatment, two major proteins of 40K and 41K mol wt (Mr) were labeled by [32P]NAD. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of pineal cells abolished [32P] radiolabeling of the 40K Mr G-protein in a dose-dependent manner. The norepinephrine-induced inhibition of both cAMP efflux and melatonin release, as assessed by RIA of medium samples collected before membrane preparation, was also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by pertussis toxin. Collectively, these results suggest that a pertussis toxin-sensitive 40K Mr G-protein labeled by [32P]NAD may be functionally associated with alpha 2-adrenergic signal transduction in chick pineal cells.",Excluded
820,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007. What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know.

1783,"Cortical activation with deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus for epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: We studied the relation between thalamic stimulation parameters and the morphology, topographic distribution and cortical sources of the cerebral responses in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus.METHODS: Bipolar and monopolar stimuli were delivered at a rate of 2 Hz to the anterior (AN, four patients), the dorsomedian (DM, four patients), and the centromedian nucleus (CM, one patient) using the programmable stimulation device (Medtronic ITREL II). Source modeling was carried out by using statistical non-parametric mapping of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) values.RESULTS: All patients demonstrated reproducible time-locked cortical responses (CRs) consisting of a sequence of components with latencies between 20 and 320 ms. The morphology of these CRs, however, was very heterogeneous, depending primarily on the site of stimulation. Following AN stimulation, cortical activation was most prominent in ipsilateral cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and lateral neocortical temporal structures. Stimulation of the DM mainly showed activation of the ipsilateral orbitofrontal and mesial and lateral frontal areas, but also involvement of mesial temporal structures. Stimulation of the CM showed a rather diffuse (though still mainly ipsilateral) increase of cortical activity. The magnitude of cortical activation was positively related to the strength of the stimulus and inversely related to the impedance of the electrode.CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cortical activation corresponded with the hodology of the involved structures and may underscore the importance of optimal localization of DBS electrodes in patients with epilepsy.SIGNIFICANCE: The method of analyzing sources of CRs could potentially be a useful tool for titration of DBS parameters in patients with electrode contacts in clinically silent areas. Furthermore, the inverse relation of the cortical activation and the impedance of the electrode contacts might suggest that these impedance measurements should be taken into consideration when adjusting DBS parameters in patients with epilepsy.",Excluded

No complications relating to radiation exposure, contrast medium use, or IVR procedures were observed. CT perfusion was useful for detecting cerebral perfusion impairment during IVR procedures. This was helpful in deciding the postoperative management. Because patients do not need to be transported to another radiographic suite to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion, the IVR-CT/angio system is ideal for safely and simply detecting cerebral perfusion defects during IVR procedures. However, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient indication for the procedure, because radiation exposure and the amount of contrast medium use are increased if the IVR procedures become difficult.",Excluded
3415,"A novel TNFRSF member, TROY (TNFRSF19), is upregulated in glioblastoma and mediates glioblastoma cell invasion and survival. Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant form of all primary adult brain tumors. Of the features that characterize GB, arguably none is more clinically significant than the propensity of glioma cells to aggressively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible and confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. To improve treatment of malignant glioma, we must find a way to stop the dispersing tumor cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their cognate receptors regulate various cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TROY gene (TNFRSF19) encodes an orphan member of the TNFR superfamily: a type I cell-surface receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic death domain but contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site. We demonstrate that TROY expression correlates inversely with patient survival and drives GB cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that TROY overexpression in glioma cells activated Rac1 signaling in a Pyk2-dependent manner to drive invasion and migration. Knockdown of TROY in a primary GB xenograft significantly prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when we activated expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using an RCAS vector system for glial-specific gene transfer in G-tva transgenic mice, astrocyte migration was induced within the brain, corroborating the in vitro importance of the TROY signaling cascade in GB invasion. TROY expression significantly increased resistance of GB cells to both IRand TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro via the Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-kappaB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings suggest that the aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY contributes to, and possibly drives, the malignant dispersion of glioma cells.",Excluded
1531,"Range modulation in proton therapy planning: a simple method for mitigating effects of increased relative biological effectiveness at the end-of-range of clinical proton beams. BACKGROUND: The increase in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of proton beams at the distal edge of the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) is a well-known phenomenon that is difficult to quantify accurately in vivo. For purposes of treatment planning, disallowing the distal SOBP to fall within vulnerable tissues hampers sparing to the extent possible with proton beam therapy (PBT). We propose the distal RBE uncertainty may be straightforwardly mitigated with a technique we call ""range modulation"". With range modulation, the distal falloff is smeared, reducing both the dose and average RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP.METHODS: One patient plan was selected to serve as an example for direct comparison of image-guided radiotherapy plans using non-range modulation PBT (NRMPBT), and range-modulation PBT (RMPBT). An additional plan using RMPBT was created to represent a re-treatment scenario (RMPBTrt) using a vertex beam. Planning statistics regarding dose, volume of the planning targets, and color images of the plans are shown.RESULTS: The three plans generated for this patient reveal that in all cases dosimetric and device manufacturing advantages are able to be achieved using RMPBT. Organ at risk (OAR) doses to critical structures such as the cochleae, optic apparatus, hypothalamus, and temporal lobes can be selectively spared using this method. Concerns about the location of the RBE that did significantly impact beam selection and treatment planning no longer have the same impact on the process, allowing these structures to be spared dose and subsequent associated issues.CONCLUSIONS: This present study has illustrated that RMPBT can improve OAR sparing while giving equivalent coverage to target volumes relative to traditional PBT methods while avoiding the increased RBE at the end of the beam. It has proven easy to design and implement and robust in our planning process. The method underscores the need to optimize treatment plans in PBT for both traditional energy dose in gray (Gy) and biologic dose (RBE).",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Pts with pathologically confirmed metastatic pNETs, complete survival data, and were alive >30 days after diagnosis were included (N=2560). Overall survival (OS) was analyzed utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank tests were used for comparison. Cox proportional hazards was performed to control for age, sex, race, grade, insurance, Charlson/Deyo Score, facility type and location, insurance, primary tumor location, tumor functional status, primary site(PSR), non-primary site(NPSR) and metastasis resection(MS), chemotherapy(CHT), radiation(RT), and year of diagnosis. Result(s): The cohort male to female ratio was 1.27. 839, 699, and 456 pts underwent PSR, NPSR, and MS respectively. The median OS was 34.3 months for the entire cohort (95% CI: 18.5-36.6), 76.6 for resected pancreatic tumors (95% CI: 71.3-86.4), and 20.4 for unresected pancreatic tumors (95% CI: 18.5-22.3), log-rank test <0.0001. In a multivariate analysis, low grade, age <60, body and tail location, and PSR, were favorable predictors for mortality. PSR HR 0.33 (p=<0.0001; 95% CI 0.26-0.42). NPSR, MS, CHT and RT were not correlated with prognosis. Conclusion(s): Patients with metastatic pNET may benefit from primary tumor resection, independently from CT or RT.",Excluded
2305,"Role of immediate-release morphine (MIR) in the treatment of predictable pain in radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is crucial in the management of cancer patients in both the curative and palliative settings. However, patients often report pain both during positioning for, and execution of, radiotherapy and this may be a reason for interrupting the radiotherapy session. This observation is common even if the patient is undergoing baseline drug therapy for cancer pain. Recent data suggest that orally administrated immediate-release morphine (MIR) is able to reduce pain in patients with predictable pain. The authors tested a rescue dose of MIR 10 or 20 mg, 20 to 60 minutes before radiotherapy, to verify the effectiveness of MIR in this setting and also to assess the patient's ability to receive the full course of radiotherapy. One hundred forty consecutive patients were evaluated during radiotherapy treatment and visual analogue scale (VAS) and positioning VAS scores were assessed. All patients completed the course of scheduled radiotherapy and pain was well controlled, despite the fact that previous pharmacological treatment had not been able to completely control chronic cancer pain. These data strongly suggest a role for MIR pretreatment in patients with pain due to positioning during radiotherapy.",Excluded
2976,"5-Aminolevulinic acid strongly enhances delayed intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by ionizing irradiation: quantitative analyses and visualization of intracellular ROS production in glioma cells in vitro. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has important roles in multimodal treatment for highly aggressive malignant gliomas. Previously, we demonstrated that multi-dose ionizing irradiation with repetitive administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) enhanced the host antitumor response and strongly inhibited tumor growth in experimental glioma. However, the mechanism of the radiosensitizing effect of 5-ALA is not known. Ionizing irradiation not only causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation initially by water radiolysis but also induces delayed production of mitochondrial ROS for mediating the long-lasting effects of ionizing irradiation on tumor cells. 5-ALA leads to high accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the mitochondria of tumor cells, yet can also improve dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in tumor cells. Here, we assessed the effect of 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis and delayed production of intracellular ROS after ionizing irradiation with 5-ALA in glioma cells in vitro. Temporal changes in intracellular 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis after ionizing irradiation in glioma cell lines were evaluated using flow cytometry (FCM). Then, the effect of 5-ALA on delayed production of intracellular ROS 12 h after ionizing irradiation in glioma cells was evaluated by FCM and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Ionizing irradiation had no effect on 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis in glioma cells. Delayed intracellular production of ROS was significantly higher than that just after ionizing irradiation, but 5-ALA pretreatment strongly enhanced the delayed intracellular production of ROS, mainly in the cytoplasm of glioma cells. This 5-ALA-induced increase in the delayed production of ROS tended to be higher in the case of 5-ALA treatment before rather than after ionizing irradiation. These results suggest that 5-ALA can affect tumor cells under ionizing irradiation, and greatly increase secondary intracellular production of ROS long after ionizing irradiation, thereby causing a radiosensitizing effect in glioma cells.",Excluded
2380,"Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy as a boost treatment for tumors in the head and neck region. The objective of this retrospective study was to report initial results of CyberKnife stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) boost for tumors in the head and neck area. Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose. Although a small volume high dose area within the normal structure could be observed in several patients, results of the present study showed potential benefits of the CyberKnife SRT boost.",Excluded

Objective : To investigate the risks and pattern of evolution of peritumoral brain edema (PTE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas. Methods : A retrospective study was conducted on 320 patients (median age 56 years, range 24-87 years) who underwent primary Gamma Knife radiosurgery for asymptomatic meningiomas between 1998 and 2012. The median tumor volume was 2.7 cc (range 0.2-10.5 cc) and the median follow-up was 48 months (range 24-168 months). Volumetric data sets for tumors and PTE on serial MRIs were analyzed. The edema index (EI) was defined as the ratio of the volume of PTE including tumor to the tumor volume, and the relative edema indices (rEIs) were calculated from serial EIs normalized against the baseline EI. Risk factors for PTE were analyzed using logistic regression. Results : Newly developed or increased PTE was noted in 49 patients (15.3%), among whom it was symptomatic in 28 patients (8.8%). Tumor volume larger than 4.2 cc (p<0.001), hemispheric tumor location (p=0.005), and pre-treatment PTE (p<0.001) were associated with an increased risk of PTE. rEI reached its maximum value at 11 months after SRS and decreased thereafter, and symptoms resolved within 24 months in most patients (85.7%). Conclusion : Caution should be exercised in decision-making on SRS for asymptomatic meningiomas of large volume (>4.2 cc), of hemispheric location, or with pre-treatment PTE. PTE usually develops within months, reaches its maximum degree until a year, and resolves within 2 years after SRS. Copyright © 2015 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
1215,"Establishment and characterization of a chemoresistant glioblastoma cell line from an Iraqi patient. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumour in humans, and has a very poor prognosis. As it is a well known fact that environmental factors especially radiation exposure is a major risk for glioblastoma multiforme and Iraq had been exposed in a relatively short period to 2 international wars with documented radiation exposure, so this paper might give justification for establishment of a new glioblastoma cell line. This cell line has been established from a cerebral glioblastoma multiforme in a 72-year-old Iraqi man who underwent surgery for an intracranial tumour in 2005. The morphology, growth kinetics, karyotype, immunocytochemistry and angiogenesis factor expression profile of this ANGM5 cell line were studied. The cell line has been grown continuously for more than 200 serial passages in standard culture media presenting no sign of cell senescence. The cultured cells are elongated or multipolar in shape and the population doubling time is 28 hours. The karyotype is complex and the chromosomal number varied between 46 and 48. The cell line is resistant to Temozolomide, cisplatin, vincristine and etoposide. This chemoresistance could be explained by the overexpression of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which found to be overexpressed by this cell line. Immunocytochemistry also showed that this cell line exhibited several characteristic features of glioblastomas, analysis of glial markers demonstrated that cells are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and negative for nestin and calbindin. Protein microarray analysis showed very high production of TIMP2 as well as other factors that are important for the invasiveness and aggressiveness of glioblastoma. This glioblastoma cell line is a useful addition to the cell lines currently available for study of the pathobiology and chemoresistance properties of glioblastoma multiforme as well as for antitumour drug discovery.",Excluded
331,Late neoplastic complications after radiation treatments for benign intracranial tumors. There is increasing interest in the use of radiation treatment as an adjunct or an alternative to microsurgery in the management of a range of intracranial tumors. Most of these treatments are performed with linear accelerator or Gamma Knife systems. Precise targeting with stereotactic localization minimizes the volume of tissue being irradiated for single and multiple fraction irradiation. The incidence of secondary neoplasms after radiosurgery may be significantly less than that reported after whole-brain or two- or three-field radiotherapy. [References: 19],Excluded

PURPOSE: To analyze the factors that affect survival in patients with brain metastases (BM) from breast cancer who were treated with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 116 women with breast cancer who were treated with WBRT alone between February 1984 and September 2000. All patients had treatment and follow-up data available in their medical charts, which we extracted for this retrospective study. We evaluated a number of potential predictors of survival after WBRT: age, primary tumor stage, control of primary tumor, presence of other systemic metastases, site of systemic metastases, Karnofsky performance status, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis class, total dose of WBRT, and number of BM. Eighteen patients received a total dose >3000 cGy and 7 received a partial brain boost.RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the median survival from the start of WBRT was 4.2 months. The 1-year survival rate was 17%, and the 2-year survival rate was 2%. Using univariate analysis, only Karnofsky performance status (p = 0. 0084), recursive partitioning analysis class (p = 0. 0147), and total WBRT dose (p = 0.0001) were predictive of longer survival. In multivariate analysis, Karnofsky performance status was the only significant predictor.CONCLUSION: Overall survival in breast cancer patients with BM treated with WBRT is poor. We recommend breast cancer patients with BM be enrolled in prospective trials to improve results.",Excluded
980,"Recommendations for measuring non-image-forming effects of light: A practical method to apply on cognitive impaired and unaffected participants. Background: The non-image-forming effects of luminous radiation on people with intellectual disabilities or dementia received attention from researchers. Such studies, however, have generally been conducted using disparate methodologies which precludes generalization and reproducibility. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study was to determine the practical applicability of measurement devices for studies investigating non-image-forming effects of luminous radiation, specifically for people with intellectual disabilities or dementia. METHOD(S): In three experiments, ten cognitive impaired people and thirty-nine unaffected subjects participated by wearing one or more portable devices. Six devices were assessed in total. Measurement data was accompanied with user experiences obtained from questionnaires, interviews and observations in order to assess the devices on practical and comfort issues. RESULT(S): On average, the devices worn by the cognitive impaired subjects were not experienced as annoying or irritating. No significant differences are found between genders and for one of the portable devices significantly less annoyance was reported by the cognitive impaired participants compared to the unaffected group of participants. INNOVATIVE SOLUTION: The three phases of the research process in towards measuring personal luminous exposures are: selection of the most suitable portable device, application of the assessment method, and the application of the device in the (pilot) study. CONCLUSION(S): However, the findings of this study suggest that inaccuracies potentially caused by practical and comfort issues associated with the portable devices need to be considered.

1405,"Differential target dependence in the developing brain: implications for mental retardation. During development of the brain, many neurons exhibit a dependence on other neuronal populations for their survival and differentiation (target dependence). Evidence suggests that some neural pathways are much more dependent on single target neuronal populations for their survival than are others (differential target dependence). This phenomenon has important implications both for animal models of congenital human brain damage and for ideas concerning the aetiology of behavioural abnormalities associated with human mental retardation. Predictions of the neuronal deficits likely to arise from exposure to cytotoxic agents (e.g. ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, viral infection) at a particular time must take differential target dependence into account. It is known that target dependence affects corticopetal pathways involved with the discriminative senses (e.g. vision), more than monoaminergic and cholinergic corticopetal pathways which are believed to be involved with arousal, selective sensory attention, sleep, memory and cortical vasomotor function. Following prenatal damage to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, this effect of differential target dependence leads not only to a relative hyperinnervation of the cortex with monoaminergic and cholinergic projections, but a specific deficit in visual pathways. The implications of this combined deficit for the behaviour and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded are considered.",Excluded
1730,"Defining survival for patients with breast cancer with brain metastases. Background: Brain metastases account for 100,000 to 170,000 cases per year in the U.S, the bulk being from breast and lung primaries. About 10-15% of breast cancer patients develop brain metastases and historically, their survival has been poor. Introduction of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents and newer radiation techniques in the past decade has led to better control of systemic disease raising the possibility of increasing incidence of brain metastases as well as better control of CNS disease. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases in our practice in the last 10 years. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart analysis and we analyzed the charts of 18 patients with breast cancer who had developed brain metastases. The parameters analyzed included patient age at diagnosis of breast cancer and at development of brain metastases, receptor status and various treatment modalities used to control local as well as Metastatic disease. Result(s): The median survival time after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and the number of brain metastases was 55 months. The time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age and number of brain metastases. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significant with a p-value of 0.007 and the number of brain metastases was not significant with a p-value of 0.55. Using the Log Rank test, median survival for Her2neu positive patients was 71 months and for Her2neu negative patients was 58 months with a non-significant p value of 0.86. Review of treatment modalities revealed that six patients underwent surgical removal of metastases and 12 patients received WBRT. Average number of systemic treatments used was 6.7 including chemotherapeutic, biological and hormonal agents. Conclusion(s): In our practice, the overall survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases was found to be 55 months after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and number of brain metastases. Overall survival did not vary significantly with the number of brain metastases and Her2neu receptor status.",Excluded
242,"Biomedical applications of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectroscopy is the most straightforward-to-use technique for studying free radicals and other paramagnetic species and has therefore established itself in biomedical research and for clinical applications. EPR found its applications in oximetry, where this technique allows repeated measurements of oxygen in tissues-also in vivo and in combination with imaging techniques. The direct detection of paramagnetic species like transition metal ions by EPR allows elucidation of their specific roles in disease, for example how copper ions might be involved in the formation of amyloid- or amyloid-like fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases. For investigations on the structures of this protein aggregates, but also of other proteins or protein complexes with medical relevance the technique of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL)-the site-specific introduction of paramagnetic reporter groups into proteins or nucleic acids-is nowadays frequently used, especially in cases where other structural techniques are not applicable. Moreover, by direct detection of free radicals-also in combination with spin trapping methods, or application of SDSL, EPR spectroscopy can be also used for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in cancer diagnostics. This review gives an up-to-date overview about how EPR spectroscopy is currently used in biomedical research and clinical applications, with special emphasis on biomedical applications of SDSL EPR.

Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to gamma-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed. The Significance Analysis of Microarray algorithm indicated 196 significant expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.42%): 67 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated genes, which belong to several classes: metabolism, adhesion/cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell cycle/apoptosis, membrane transport, DNA repair/DNA damage signaling, transcription factor, intracellular signaling, and RNA processing. Differential expression patterns of five selected genes (HSPA9B, INPP5A, PIP5K1A, FANCG, and TPP2) observed by the microarray analysis were further confirmed by the quantitative real time RT-PCR method, which demonstrated an up-regulation status of those genes.

1722,"Surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies in patients with metastatic melanoma. OBJECTIVES: To describe treatment patterns with surgery, radiation, and systemic (drug) therapies in patients with metastatic melanoma in the United States. METHOD(S): Using a large US medical claims database, patients were identified between 2005 and 2010 using =2 melanoma diagnoses (ICD-9-CM: 172.xx, V10.82) and=2 diagnoses for metastasis (ICD-9-CM: 197.xx, 198.xx). The index date was the first date of metastasis diagnosis. Patients were followed from the index date to death, disenrollment, or end of the study period (6/30/2010), whichever occurred first. Surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies were examined descriptively. Factors influencing treatment were examined using a logistic regression separately for surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy. RESULT(S): A total of 2546 patients with metastatic melanoma were included in the analyses. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 60.6 (+/- 14.0) years old with 22.8% under 50 and 36.5% were female. Overall, 66.8% of patients had cancer treatment related surgery, 38.7% received systemic therapies, 44.7% received radiation, and 17.7% of patients received all three treatments. Logistic regressions revealed that patients with lung (p <0.0001), brain (p <0.0001), liver (p <0.0001), or bone (p <0.0001) metastases were less likely to have surgeries; patients with lung (p = 0.04), brain (p < 0.001), or liver metastases (p = 0.03) were more likely to receive systemic therapies; as expected patients with brain (p < 0.0001) or bone metastases (p < 0.0001) were more likely to have radiation therapy. Patients being treated by oncologists were more likely to receive systemic therapy (p < 0.0001) or radiation (p < 0.0001) while patients being treated by dermatologists were more likely to receive surgery subsequently (p = 0.002).

PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between neurocognitive function (NCF) and quality of life (QOL) in patients with brain metastases after whole-brain radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 208 patients from the whole-brain radiotherapy arm of a Phase III trial (PCI-P120-9801), who underwent regular NCF and QOL (ADL [activities of daily living] and FACT-Br [Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain-specific]) testing, were analyzed. Spearman's rank correlation was calculated between NCF and QOL, using each patient's own data, at each time point. To test the hypothesis that NCF declines before QOL changes, the predictive effect of NCF from previous visits on QOL was studied with a linear mixed-effects model. Neurocognitive function or QOL deterioration was defined relative to each patient's own baseline. Lead or lag time, defined as NCF deterioration before or after the date of QOL decline, respectively, was computed.RESULTS: At baseline, all NCF tests showed statistically significant correlations with ADL, which became stronger at 4 months. A similar observation was made with FACT-Br. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits predicted ADL (p < 0.05 for seven of eight tests) or FACT-Br. Scores on all eight NCF tests deteriorated before ADL decline (net lead time 9-153 days); and scores on six of eight NCF tests deteriorated before FACT-Br (net lead time 9-82 days).CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive function and QOL are correlated. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits are predictive of QOL. Neurocognitive function deterioration precedes QOL decline. The sequential association between NCF and QOL decline suggests that delaying NCF deterioration is a worthwhile treatment goal in brain metastases patients.",Excluded

The action of 550 W/m2 (mean) 3100 MHz pulsed radiation on the rabbit retina in vivo was investigated by fundus photography, blood-retinal barrier tracers, light and electron microscopy, either after a single 1--1.5 h exposure or after a series of repeated 1 h exposures for up to 53 h during about 100 days. The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers.

3438,"Characterization of Na+-activated K+ currents in larval lamprey spinal cord neurons. Potassium channels play an important role in controlling neuronal firing and synaptic interactions. Na(+)-activated K(+) (K(Na)) channels have been shown to exist in neurons in different regions of the CNS, but their physiological function has been difficult to assess. In this study, we have examined if neurons in the spinal cord possess K(Na) currents. We used whole cell recordings from isolated spinal cord neurons in lamprey. These neurons display two different K(Na) currents. The first was transient and activated by the Na(+) influx during the action potentials, and it was abolished when Na(+) channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin. The second K(Na) current was sustained and persisted in tetrodotoxin. Both K(Na) currents were abolished when Na(+) was substituted with choline or N-methyl-D-glucamine, indicating that they are indeed dependent on Na(+) influx into neurons. When Na(+) was substituted with Li(+), the amplitude of the inward current was unchanged, whereas the transient K(Na) current was reduced but not abolished. This suggests that the transient K(Na) current is partially activated by Li(+). These two K(Na) currents have different roles in controlling the action potential waveform. The transient K(Na) appears to act as a negative feedback mechanism sensing the Na(+) influx underlying the action potential and may thus be critical for setting the amplitude and duration of the action potential. The sustained K(Na) current has a slow kinetic of activation and may underlie the slow Ca(2+)-independent afterhyperpolarization mediated by repetitive firing in lamprey spinal cord neurons.",Excluded
2931,"Initial Gamma Knife radiosurgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. OBJECT: Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and, when symptomatic, typically require surgical removal as an initial means of management. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients whose comorbidities substantially increase the risks of resection. In this report, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial GKRS for NFAs.METHODS: An international group of three academic Gamma Knife centers retrospectively reviewed outcome data in 569 patients with NFAs.RESULTS: Forty-one patients (7.2%) underwent GKRS as primary management for their NFAs because of an advanced age, multiple comorbidities, or patient preference. The median age at the time of radiosurgery was 69 years. Thirty-seven percent of the patients had hypopituitarism before GKRS. Patients received a median tumor margin dose of 12 Gy (range 6.2-25.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. The overall tumor control rate was 92.7%, and the actuarial tumor control rate was 94% and 85% at 5 and 10 years postradiosurgery, respectively. Three patients with tumor growth or symptom progression underwent resection at 3, 3, and 96 months after GKRS, respectively. New or worsened hypopituitarism developed in 10 patients (24%) at a median interval of 37 months after GKRS. One patient suffered new-onset cranial nerve palsy. No other radiosurgical complications were noted. Delayed hypopituitarism was observed more often in patients who had received a tumor margin dose > 18 Gy (p = 0.038) and a maximum dose > 36 Gy (p = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, GKRS resulted in long-term control of NFAs in 85% of patients at 10 years. This experience suggests that GKRS provides long-term tumor control with an acceptable risk profile. This approach may be especially valuable in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities, and those who have endocrine-inactive tumors without visual compromise due to mass effect of the adenoma.",Excluded

Purpose To explore the use of PINS radiofrequency (RF) pulses to reduce RF power deposition in multiband/simultaneous multislice imaging with the RARE/turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence at 3T and 7T. Methods A PINS-TSE sequence was implemented and combined with blipped CAIPI to improve the reconstruction of superposed slices. Whole brain imaging of healthy volunteers was performed at both 3T and 7T using a 32-channel coil for signal reception. Results A considerable reduction in power deposition was achieved compared with a standard sequence of the manufacturer. At 3T, the reduction in specific absorption rate (SAR) made short pulse repetition times (TRs) possible, however, in order to obtain a good T2 contrast, it is advisable to maintain TR while extending the echo train length. At 7T, whole brain coverage with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 2 mm<sup>3</sup> was achieved in an acquisition time of 150 s. Furthermore, it could be shown that pulse sequences that use PINS pulses do not suffer from having additional magnetization transfer contrast. Conclusion PINS RF pulses combined with multiband imaging reduce SAR sufficiently to enable routine TSE imaging at 7T within clinically acceptable acquisition times. In general, the combination of multiband imaging with PINS RF pulses represents a method to reduce total RF power deposition. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Results obtained by IPA SPET were retrospectively compared with histopathology, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Tumour lesions were clearly demonstrated by IPA SPET at 30 min, 1 h and 4.5 h post-injection, even in patients with low grade gliomas. In patients with glioblastoma, excellent visualization of the tumour was possible even at 7 h p.i., indicative of the high retention of the radiopharmaceutical in cerebral gliomas. Analysis of the radioactivity in plasma and urine attested to the high in vivo stability of IPA. Blood clearance was rapid (> 65% after 10 min) and IPA was excreted predominantly by the kidneys, the urinary radioactivity excretion ranging from 27% at 1 h to 54% of injected doses at 5 h p.i. The average effective dose for adults was estimated to be 0.0152 mSv.MBq<sup>-1</sup>, leading to an effective dose of 3.8 mSv in a typical brain SPET investigation with 250 MBq IPA. This result strongly suggests that IPA is a potentially valuable brain tumour imaging agent for widespread clinical studies with SPET. Its high specific tumour uptake and retention even in low grade gliomas represent a major advantage compared to presently available SPET radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, the radiation dose estimates indicate that clinical use of IPA will result in acceptable radiation dose levels in humans. (© 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).",Excluded

PURPOSE: Neurotoxic effects of brain irradiation include cognitive impairment in 50% to 90% of patients. Prior studies have suggested that donepezil, a neurotransmitter modulator, may improve cognitive function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 198 adult brain tumor survivors >= 6 months after partial- or whole-brain irradiation were randomly assigned to receive a single daily dose (5 mg for 6 weeks, 10 mg for 18 weeks) of donepezil or placebo. A cognitive test battery assessing memory, attention, language, visuomotor, verbal fluency, and executive functions was administered before random assignment and at 12 and 24 weeks. A cognitive composite score (primary outcome) and individual cognitive domains were evaluated.RESULTS: Of this mostly middle-age, married, non-Hispanic white sample, 66% had primary brain tumors, 27% had brain metastases, and 8% underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation. After 24 weeks of treatment, the composite scores did not differ significantly between groups (P = .48); however, significant differences favoring donepezil were observed for memory (recognition, P = .027; discrimination, P = .007) and motor speed and dexterity (P = .016). Significant interactions between pretreatment cognitive function and treatment were found for cognitive composite (P = .01), immediate recall (P = .05), delayed recall (P = .004), attention (P = .01), visuomotor skills (P = .02), and motor speed and dexterity (P < .001), with the benefits of donepezil greater for those who were more cognitively impaired before study treatment.CONCLUSION: Treatment with donepezil did not significantly improve the overall composite score, but it did result in modest improvements in several cognitive functions, especially among patients with greater pretreatment impairments.",Excluded
3300,"Comparison of aberrant DNA methylation in rectal tissues before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Aim: Aberrant DNA methylation is implicated in the pathogenesis of rectal cancer. In studies investigating methylation and the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the effect of this treatment upon the methylation itself is not well understood. We aimed to investigate any differences in methylation before or after treatment. Method(s): Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer were identified. Tumour tissue from pretreatment biopsies and post treatment resections for the same patients was subjected to DNA extraction. This was also modelled in vitro by administering ionizing radiation (7-15 Gy) to a colorectal cancer cell line and extracting DNA 48 hour later. Methylation specific PCR was used to characterize the methylation status of CpG islands in the promoter regions of 8 genes associated with rectal cancer. PCR band size and intensity was measured to give a semiquantiative analysis of methylation intensity in the cell line experiment. Result(s): 17 patients underwent analysis. Methylation was seen less frequently in post treatment specimens for all 8 markers, however, this difference was significant for one marker (ADAMTS1, 10/17 methylated pre vs 0/17 post, P = 0.001) and approached significance for another (hMLH1, 6/17 vs 1/17, P = 0.08). In the cell line study, methylation band intensity was significantly reduced above a dose of 10 Gy for both ADAMTS1 (P = 0.05) and NEUROG1 (P < 0.05) markers. Conclusion(s): Ionizing radiation appears to affect rectal cancer DNA methylation in patients and in an in vitro model. Further studies into this phenomenon are indicated, however, investigators should consider this when studying DNA methylation in patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Excluded
1306,"Reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol in the outer segments of frog and mouse rod photoreceptors. The first step in the Visual Cycle, the series of reactions that regenerate the vertebrate visual pigment rhodopsin, is the reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol, a reaction that requires NADPH. We have used the fluorescence of all-trans retinol to study this reduction in living rod photoreceptors. After the bleaching of rhodopsin, fluorescence (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 457 or 540 nm) appears in frog and wild-type mouse rod outer segments reaching a maximum in 30-60 min at room temperature. With this excitation and emission, the mitochondrial-rich ellipsoid region of the cells shows strong fluorescence as well. Fluorescence measurements at different emission wavelengths establish that the outer segment and ellipsoid signals originate from all-trans retinol and reduced pyridine nucleotides, respectively. Using outer segment fluorescence as a measure of all-trans retinol formation, we find that in frog rod photoreceptors the NADPH necessary for the reduction of all-trans retinal can be supplied by both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways. Inhibition of the reduction reaction, either by retinoic acid or through suppression of metabolic activity, reduced the formation of retinol. Finally, there are no significant fluorescence changes after bleaching in the rod outer segments of Rpe65(-/-) mice, which lack 11-cis retinal.",Excluded
182,"Mechanism of magnetization transfer during on-resonance water saturation. A new approach to detect mobile proteins, peptides, and lipids. The mechanism of magnetization transfer (MT) between water and components of the proton spectrum was studied ex vivo in a perfused cell system and in vivo in the rat brain (n = 5). Water was selectively labeled and spectral buildup consequential to transfer of longitudinal magnetization was followed as a function of time. At short mixing time (T(m)), nitrogen-bound solvent-exchangeable protons were observed, predominantly assigned to amide groups of proteins and peptides. At longer T(m), intramolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) was observed in the aliphatic proton region, leading to a mobile-macromolecule-weighted spectrum that resembles typical protein spectra described in the literature. This effect on the proton spectrum is distinct from that of classical off-resonance MT, which has been shown to be due to the immobile solid-like proton pool. When studying a solution of major brain metabolites under physiological concentrations and conditions (pH), no transfer effects were observed, in line with expectations based on reduced NOE effects in rapidly tumbling molecules and the fast proton exchange rates of amino, amine, SH, and OH groups. The spectral intensities of the amide protons may serve as indicators for pH and cellular levels of mobile proteins and peptides, while the aliphatic components are representative of several types of mobile macromolecules, including proteins, peptides, and lipids.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to quantify the reduction in patient radiation dose by X-ray imaging technology using image noise reduction and system settings for neuroangiography and to assess its impact on the working habits of the physician.METHODS: Radiation dose data from 190 neuroangiographies and 112 interventional neuroprocedures performed with state-of-the-art image processing and reference system settings were collected for the period January-June 2010. The system was then configured with extra image noise reduction algorithms and system settings, which enabled radiation dose reduction without loss of image quality. Radiation dose data from 174 neuroangiographies and 138 interventional neuroprocedures were collected for the period January-June 2012. Procedures were classified as diagnostic or interventional. Patient radiation exposure was quantified using cumulative dose area product and cumulative air kerma. Impact on working habits of the physician was quantified using fluoroscopy time and number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images.RESULTS: The optimized system settings provided significant reduction in dose indicators versus reference system settings (p<0.001): from 124 to 47 Gy cm(2) and from 0.78 to 0.27 Gy for neuroangiography, and from 328 to 109 Gy cm(2) and from 2.71 to 0.89 Gy for interventional neuroradiology. Differences were not significant between the two systems with regard to fluoroscopy time or number of DSA images.CONCLUSION: X-ray imaging technology using an image noise reduction algorithm and system settings provided approximately 60% radiation dose reduction in neuroangiography and interventional neuroradiology, without affecting the working habits of the physician.",Excluded
475,"Effect of Pregabalin on Radiotherapy-Related Neuropathic Pain in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial. PURPOSE: Neuropathic pain is an unavoidable treatment-related adverse event among patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of pregabalin versus placebo in the treatment of radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in four centers in China. Eligible patients with a mean pain intensity score of 4 or more on an 11-point numeric rating scale were randomly assigned to receive either active treatment with a flexible dose of pregabalin or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was pain reduction measured on the numeric rating scale.RESULT: There were 128 patients who received treatment as randomly assigned. Pain intensity reduction was 2.44 in the pregabalin arm and 1.58 in the placebo arm at week 16, yielding an adjusted mean difference of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.44; P = .003). In the pregabalin arm, 38 patients (59.4%) achieved at least 30% pain relief versus 21 (32.8%) in the placebo arm ( P = .006). Nineteen patients (29.7%) in the pregabalin group and five (7.8%) in the placebo group achieved 50% or greater pain relief ( P = .003). Total scores on the Profile of Mood States-Short Form, pain severity and functional interference of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, as well as the physiology and psychology domain of the WHO Quality of Life-BREF all were reduced significantly at week 16 in patients who received pregabalin compared with those who received placebo. There was no significant difference ( P = .29) in the incidence of experiencing at least one adverse event in the pregabalin arm (n = 35; 54.7%) versus the placebo arm (n = 29; 45.3%).CONCLUSION: Patients treated with pregabalin with radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain had greater pain alleviation, better mood states, and higher quality of life compared with patients in the placebo group, with a good tolerability.",Excluded

Background: This study aims to investgate the effect of reference dose calculaton grid size (RDCGS) on gamma passing rate (GPR) for patent-specific quality assurance of intensity-modulated radiaton therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 20 patents were retrospectvely selected. Both IMRT and VMAT plans were generated for each patent. Reference dose distributons for gamma analysis were calculated with RDCGS of 1-5 mm at intervals of 1 mm. Dose distributons were measured using MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK dosimeters. Both global and local gamma analyses with gamma criteria of 3%/3 mm, 2%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, and 2%/1 mm were performed with various RDCGS. Result(s): As the RDCGS increased from 1 mm to 5 mm, the average global GPRs with 2%/2 mm for VMAT with MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK decreased by 9.3% and 5.9%, respectvely. The average local GPRs decreased by 14% and 11.7%, respectvely. For IMRT, the global GPRs decreased by 4.8% and 6%, respectvely, whereas the local GPRs decreased by 10.5% and 8.6%, respectvely. The effect of the RDCGS on the GPRs became larger when performing local gamma analysis as well as when applying small distance-to-agreement (DTA). As the RDCGS increased, the average changes in the GPR per mm of DTA change increased regardless of the type of radiotherapy, detector, or gamma analysis. Conclusion(s): For an accurate verificaton of the IMRT and VMAT plans, it is recommended that the reference dose distributon must be calculated with the smallest possible RDCGS.

2985,"Hippocampal-sparing and target volume coverage in treating 3 to 10 brain metastases: A comparison of Gamma Knife, single-isocenter VMAT, CyberKnife, and TomoTherapy stereotactic radiosurgery. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate hippocampal doses and target volume coverage with and without hippocampal sparing when treating multiple brain metastases using various stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) platforms.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We selected 10 consecutive patients with 14 separate treatments who had been treated in our department for 3 to 10 brain metastases and added hippocampal avoidance contours. All 14 treatments were planned with GammaPlan for Gamma Knife, Eclipse for single isocenter volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), TomoTherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS) for TomoTherapy, and MultiPlan for CyberKnife. Initial planning was performed with the goal of planning target volume coverage of V100 >=95% without hippocampal avoidance. If the maximum hippocampal point dose (Dmax) was <6.6 Gy in a single fraction and <40% of the hippocampi received <=4.5 Gy, no second plan was performed. If either constraint was not met, replanning was performed with these constraints.RESULTS: There was a median of 6 metastases per plan, with an average total tumor volume of 7.32 mL per plan. The median hippocampal Dmax (in Gy) without sparing averaged 1.65, 9.81, 4.38, and 5.46, respectively (P < .0001). Of 14 plans, 3 Gamma Knife and CyberKnife plans required replanning, whereas 13 VMAT and 8 TomoTherapy plans required replanning. The hippocampal constraints were not achievable in 1 plan on any platform when the tumor was bordering the hippocampus. The mean volume of brain receiving 12 Gy (in mL), which has been associated with symptomatic radionecrosis, was 23.57 with Gamma Knife, 76.77 with VMAT, 40.86 with CyberKnife, and 104.06 with TomoTherapy (P = .01). The overall average conformity indices for all plans ranged from 0.36 to 0.52.CONCLUSIONS: Even with SRS, the hippocampi can receive a considerable dose; however, if the hippocampi are outlined as organs of risk, sparing these structures is feasible in nearly all situations with all 4 platforms, without detriment to target coverage, and should be considered in all patients undergoing SRS for multiple brain metastases.SUMMARY: Hippocampi play an important role in memory, and sparing of these structures in whole brain radiation can improve neurocognitive outcomes. The hippocampi are not routinely spared when using stereotactic radiosurgery. We evaluated the incidental dose to the hippocampi when treating multiple brain metastases and sought to examine if hippocampal sparing is feasible without detriment to target coverage. We found that hippocampal sparing is possible without affecting coverage or conformality in most cases across treatment platforms.",Excluded

The outcome of our research is important for (1) promoting the evidence-based radiotherapy and (2) clarifying the radiation risk in space. We are currently conducting the following experiments; LET-RBE relationship for cell kills, chromatin damages and mutation induction, mitochondrial damages, brain damages at cellular and behavioral level, and fractionated irradiation to skin, gut and tumors. Capacity of cells to repair DNA damages may play an important role in space radiation environment that is characterized as a long-term exposure at low dose rates with mixed LET radiation. Experiments using cells deficient of DNA repair suggested that a process of damage recognition is critical for biological effectiveness of high LET radiation.

1294,"Short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy before total mesorectal excision (TME) versus preoperative chemoradiotherapy, TME, and optional adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (RAPIDO): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Systemic relapses remain a major problem in locally advanced rectal cancer. Using short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy and delayed surgery, the Rectal cancer And Preoperative Induction therapy followed by Dedicated Operation (RAPIDO) trial aimed to reduce distant metastases without compromising locoregional control.METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, participants were recruited from 54 centres in the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Slovenia, Denmark, Norway, and the USA. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, had a biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, primary, locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, which was classified as high risk on pelvic MRI (with at least one of the following criteria: clinical tumour [cT] stage cT4a or cT4b, extramural vascular invasion, clinical nodal [cN] stage cN2, involved mesorectal fascia, or enlarged lateral lymph nodes), were mentally and physically fit for chemotherapy, and could be assessed for staging within 5 weeks before randomisation. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a management system with a randomly varying block design (each block size randomly chosen to contain two to four allocations), stratified by centre, ECOG performance status, cT stage, and cN stage, to either the experimental or standard of care group. All investigators remained masked for the primary endpoint until a prespecified number of events was reached. Patients allocated to the experimental treatment group received short-course radiotherapy (5 x 5 Gy over a maximum of 8 days) followed by six cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy (capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily on days 1-14, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 15-21) or nine cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, leucovorin [folinic acid] 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1 and 2, followed by bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously and fluorouracil 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for 22 h on days 1 and 2, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 3-14) followed by total mesorectal excision. Choice of CAPOX or FOLFOX4 was per physician discretion or hospital policy. Patients allocated to the standard of care group received 28 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy up to 50.4 Gy or 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy up to 50.0 Gy (per physician discretion or hospital policy), with concomitant twice-daily oral capecitabine 825 mg/m<sup>2</sup> followed by total mesorectal excision and, if stipulated by hospital policy, adjuvant chemotherapy with eight cycles of CAPOX or 12 cycles of FOLFOX4. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-related treatment failure, defined as the first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new primary colorectal tumour, or treatment-related death, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed by intention to treat. This study is registered with the EudraCT, 2010-023957-12, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01558921, and is now complete.FINDINGS: Between June 21, 2011, and June 2, 2016, 920 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment, of whom 912 were eligible (462 in the experimental group; 450 in the standard of care group). Median follow-up was 4.6 years (IQR 3.5-5.5). At 3 years after randomisation, the cumulative probability of disease-related treatment failure was 23.7% (95% CI 19.8-27.6) in the experimental group versus 30.4% (26.1-34.6) in the standard of care group (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95; p=0.019). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event during preoperative therapy in both groups was diarrhoea (81 [18%] of 460 patients in the experimental group and 41 [9%] of 441 in the standard of care group) and neurological toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy in the standard of care group (16 [9%] of 187 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 177 (38%) of 460 participants in the experimental group and, in the standard of care group, in 87 (34%) of 254 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy and in 64 (34%) of 187 with adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four participants in the experimental group (one cardiac arrest, one pulmonary embolism, two infectious complications) and in four participants in the standard of care group (one pulmonary embolism, one neutropenic sepsis, one aspiration, one suicide due to severe depression).INTERPRETATION: The observed decreased probability of disease-related treatment failure in the experimental group is probably indicative of the increased efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy as opposed to adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting. Therefore, the experimental treatment can be considered as a new standard of care in high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.FUNDING: Dutch Cancer Foundation, Swedish Cancer Society, Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and Spanish Clinical Research Network.",Excluded
2474,"Optimizing cancer radiotherapy with 2-deoxy-D-glucose: Dose escalation studies in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Background and Purpose: Higher rates of glucose utilization and glycolysis generally correlate with poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors. Own earlier studies on model systems demonstrated that the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner by selectively sensitizing cancer cells while protecting normal cells. Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that the combination of 2-DG, at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), with large fractions of gamma-radiation was well tolerated in cerebral glioma patients. Since higher 2-DG doses are expected to improve the therapeutic gain, present studies were undertaken to examine the tolerance and safety of escalating 2-DG dose during combined treatment (2-DG + radiotherapy) in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme (WHO criteria) were included in the study. Seven weekly fractions of <sup>60</sup>Co gamma-rays (5 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor volume (presurgical CT/MRI evaluation) plus 3 cm margin. Escalating 2-DG doses (200-250-300 mg/kg BW) were administered orally 30 min before irradiation after overnight fasting. Acute toxicity and tolerance were studied by monitoring the vital parameters and side effects. Late radiation damage and treatment responses were studied radiologically and clinically in surviving patients. Result(s): Transient side effects similar to hypoglycemia were observed in most of the patients. Tolerance and patient compliance to the combined treatment were very good up to a 2-DG dose of 250 mg/kg BW. However, at the higher dose of 300 mg/kg BW, two out of six patients were very restless and could not complete treatment, though significant changes in the vital parameters were not observed even at this dose. No significant damage to the normal brain tissue was observed during follow-up in seven out of ten patients who received complete treatment and survived between 11 and 46 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Oral administration of 2-DG combined with large fractions of radiation (5 Gy/fraction/week) is safe and could be tolerated in glioblastoma patients without any acute toxicity and late radiation damage to the normal brain. Further clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the combined treatment are warranted. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
2589,"Neuromagnetic responses to chords are modified by preceding musical scale. Previous psychological studies have shown that musical chords primed by Western musical scale in a tonal and modal schema are perceived in a hierarchy of stability. We investigated such priming effects on auditory magnetic responses to tonic-major and submediant-minor chords preceded by major scales and tonic-minor and submediant-major chords preceded by minor scales. Musically trained subjects participated in the experiment. During MEG recordings, subjects judged perceptual stability of the chords. The tonic chords were judged to be stable, whereas the submediant chords were judged to be unstable. Dipole moments of N1m response originating in the auditory cortex were larger in the left hemisphere for the submediant chords than for the tonic chords preceded by the major but not minor scales. No difference in the N1m or P2m moment was found for the chords presented without preceding scales. These results suggest priming effects of the tonal schema, interacting with contextual modality, on neural activity of the auditory cortex as well as perceptual stability of the chords. It is inferred that modulation of the auditory cortical activity is associated with attention induced by tonal instability and modality shift, which characterize the submediant chords.",Excluded

2398,"X-ray and optical stereo-based 3D sensor fusion system for image-guided neurosurgery. Purpose: In neurosurgery, an image-guided operation is performed to confirm that the surgical instruments reach the exact lesion position. Among the multiple imaging modalities, an X-ray fluoroscope mounted on C- or O-arm is widely used for monitoring the position of surgical instruments and the target position of the patient. However, frequently used fluoroscopy can result in relatively high radiation doses, particularly for complex interventional procedures. The proposed system can reduce radiation exposure and provide the accurate three-dimensional (3D) position information of surgical instruments and the target position. Method(s): X-ray and optical stereo vision systems have been proposed for the C- or O-arm. Two subsystems have same optical axis and are calibrated simultaneously. This provides easy augmentation of the camera image and the X-ray image. Further, the 3D measurement of both systems can be defined in a common coordinate space. Result(s): The proposed dual stereoscopic imaging system is designed and implemented for mounting on an O-arm. The calibration error of the 3D coordinates of the optical stereo and X-ray stereo is within 0.1 mm in terms of the mean and the standard deviation. Further, image augmentation with the camera image and the X-ray image using an artificial skull phantom is achieved. Conclusion(s): As the developed dual stereoscopic imaging system provides 3D coordinates of the point of interest in both optical images and fluoroscopic images, it can be used by surgeons to confirm the position of surgical instruments in a 3D space with minimum radiation exposure and to verify whether the instruments reach the surgical target observed in fluoroscopic images.

Aim: The purpose of our review was to evaluate results of radiosurgery for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. Background(s): Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer and the most common source of brain metastases. Radiosurgery allows the precise focal delivery of a high single radiation dose to brain metastases and results in high rates of local control. Material(s) and Method(s): 83 patients were treated between 2006 and 2008. We evaluated local control and outcome after radiosurgery and identified prognostic factors. Result(s): Median survival in the whole group was 7.8 months from radiosurgery and 11 months from diagnosis. Median survival in classes I, II and III was 13.2, 8.2 and 2.2 months. For 94% of patients symptoms improved or stabilised at the first follow-up visit and this status did not change during 7.1 months. According to the univariate analysis, factors associated with improved survival included: RPA class 1 compared with RPA 2 and 3, RPA class 2 compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, control of the primary disease, radiosurgery performed more than once, level of haemoglobin >7mmol/1, absence of extracranial metastases, volume of the biggest lesion <11cm<sup>3</sup>. The multivariate analysis confirmed a significant influence on survival for the following factors: RPA class 1 as compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, absence of extracranial metastases, multiplicity of radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment. It proved to be effective and safe in older patients. Selection of patients who are likely to benefit most should be based on prognostic factors. KPS proved to be the most important prognostic factor. In the RPA III group (patients with KPS. <. 70) survival time was similar to that achieved after symptomatic medical management. © 2013 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded
1694,"Effects of millimeter waves on ionic currents of Lymnaea neurons. The effects of mm-waves 60.22-62.22 GHz and 75 GHz on A-type K+ currents and the effects of 61.22 GHz on Ca2+ currents of Lymnaea neurons were investigated using a whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. The open end of a rectangular waveguide covered with a thin Teflon film served as a radiator. Specific absorption rates at the waveguide outlet, inserted into physiological solution, were in the range of 0-2400 W/kg. Millimeter wave irradiation increased the peak amplitudes, activation rates, and inactivation rates of both ion currents. The changes in A-type K+ current were not dependent on the irradiation frequency. It was shown that the changes in the amplitudes and kinetics of both currents resulted from the temperature rise produced by irradiation. No additional effects of irradiation on A-type K+ current other than thermal were found when tested at the phase transition temperature or in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol reduced the thermal effect of irradiation. Millimeter waves had no effect on the steady-state activation and inactivation curves, suggesting that the membrane surface charge and binding of calcium ions to the membrane in the area of channel locations did not change.",Excluded
3197,"Refresher course: Ultrasound guided chronic pain management: Evidence and practice. Ultrasound has become a popular tool utilized in the performance of chronic pain interventions. Traditionally, procedures in pain medicine were performed using anatomic landmarks, fluoroscopy or CT scan. While the semodalities continue to be utilized, there has been a tremendous growth in the use of ultrasound by pain practitioners. Interventional techniques for acute and chronic pain management have traditionally performed upon a combination of anatomical landmarks, electron eurostimulation or imaging. All this techniques are usefull but, ENS has no help in avoiding puncture of vessels, pleura or other structure. Fluoroscopy is effective for visualization of bony structures but not soft tissues. It thus has limitations when performing procedures for peripheral procedures. While CT scan is better than fluoroscopy for visualization of bony structures and soft tissue, it can be cost prohibitive and is associated with significant radiation exposure to the patient and practitioner Most pain management guidelines have moved towards recommending image guidance such as ultrasound, fluoroscopy or CT scan for interventional procedures. This is largely due to the increased accuracy, reliability (precision) and safety associated with structure visualization. Ultrasound can identify other structures asmuscles, ligaments, vessels, joint and bony surfaces. An ultrasound machine is affordable, portable and does not diffuse radiation, its use has not be associated with any risk both for patients and practitioners. The image that we can see is real time and can be performed continuously along the procedure Ultrasound can be implemented in office-based practice for diagnostic and therapeutic injections. Mergin experience from various specialities seems to be a way for forward. Musculoskeletal US experts (radiologists, rheumatologists) may help to develop skills in joint injections. Trigger point injections (including Botulinum Toxin A) are not longer to be blind but specific group of muscle can be targeted and potential complications (pneumothorax, intraperitoneal, intravaascular injections) avoided. Anesthetists with experience with peripheral nerve blocks under ultrasound guidance naturally progress to blocks in field of chronic pain. Chronic pain procedures may include nerve blocks, many spinal approches, including epidurals, selective nerve block, facet joints, medial branch blocks and sympathetic blocks. More recently ultrasound guidance has been used as aid placement of peripheral neuromodulation electrodes. What limitations. High frequency probe providing high resolution pictures but will not penetrate deep tissue. Low frequency probe penetrates deeper but quality of pictures is degradeed. Structures like bones are not easily penetrated by ultrasound wave producing scattering or artifacts. Spine procedures: The primary advantage of ultrasonography (besides no radiation exposure) is direct visualization of soft tissue structures, it is particularly beneficial in cervical spine injections, where the multitude of blood vessels and other vital soft tissue structures make this area particularly vulnerable to injury if only fluoroscopy-guided injections are used. Ultrasound is an excellent tool in ""visualizing"" and, hence, ""avoiding"" vascular injury during cervical spine procedures, whereas contrast fluoroscopy can only ""detect"" when the tip of the needle is intravascular. One should be mindful that fluoroscopy may not detect that the needle has already traversed a vessel on its way to the target, whereas ultrasound can avoid this. Ultrasound guided lumbar intra-articular and medial branch block was compared to the most commonly used fluoroscopically guided approach. Very good result were obtained with US technique but limitations also exist when compared to fluoroscopically based technique. These limitiations are: obese patients, chllenge in detecting intravascular injection at such a depth, the possible need for a larger-gauge needle to improve visibility[1]. Thus despite the increasing number of paper published no recomandations can be given at this time if US is superior to fluoroscopy. On the contrary third occipital nerve block under fluoroscopy has a false positive rate of 38% and accurate needle placement up to 82% has been achieved with US guidance[2]. Also US guided stellate ganglion block helps in decreasing complications. With the anatomical landmarks trechnique several side effects or complications can occur. Puncture of the oesophagus leading to mediastinitis or carotid artery or other thyroids vessels puncture are serous complications. US guidance increases the incidence of successful sympathetic block and lowers the incidence of hoarseness associated with local anesthetic injections above the prevertebral fascia.[3] US guidance is very helpfull in border nerve syndromes (genitofemoral, iliinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves) where anatomical landmarks are confusing. Anatomical variability of the course of this nerves and distributiona of the sensory innervated skin area are very high. US helps in needle visualisation and makes anatomy more predictable.[4] In trunk pain US helps to visualise ribs, pleura, muscle layers. US makes the block easier and safer. In other sitution as pudendal neuralgia diagnosis is primarily a clinical one, confirmed by a diagnostic block. Tha interligamentous plane is the key to local anesthetic placement. US helps in real time visualisation of needle placement and confirmation of an injectate sperad within the interlegamentous plane. Almost 100% block success has been achieved by this technique and by identifyng pudendal artery and depositing local anesthetic solution media to the artery[5] US was considered a standard tool also for musculoskeletal pain. All joint injection can better performed under US guidance.[6] Ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve stimulation avoids the invasiveness of electrode placement via an open procedure while providing excellent pain relief. There are limitations of the percutaneous approach when navigating close to large blood vessels, a situation more appropriately managed with open peripheral nerve stimulator placement. Ultrasound-guided placement may be considered for patients receiving peripheral nerve stimulators placed within the deep tissues, and not easily placed in a blind fashion.[7] Conclusion(s): US systems are more available and cheap these days. Transportable devices give high resolution and quality pictures. This device is available in almost every hospital. Potential advantages of ultrasound are: no hazard of radiation exposure, it could be done in every position, visualization of nerves and surrounding structures: vessels, muscles, bone and visceral pleura, lung, peritoneum, bowel, diagnostic recognizing anatomical variability and pathology real time image of needle, needle nerve contact and inject it spread, reduce complication: nerve injury, vessels puncture, pneumothorax etc., higher success rate, quicker onset, reduces performance time, reduce volume of local anesthetic. A problem with the application of ultrasound in chronic pain interventions is that randomised controlled trials may not be ethical while comparing to fluoroscopy or CT. Wide world use of ultrasound guidance into clinical practice has to come as its use a tool, from clinical outcome studies. Its further development will depends on training and education.

959,"Radiation therapy for the treatment of tumours in small companion animals. Radiation is becoming widely available to treat tumours in veterinary patients. Orthovoltage machines capable of delivering low energy external beam radiation are less versatile than linear accelerators and cobalt-60 machines that deliver megavoltage radiation. In addition, electron beam capabilities that are available with some linear accelerators allow more targeted treatment in smaller patients. Acute effects of radiation are to be expected, but in nearly all cases such side effects resolve without limiting protocols. In contrast, late effects of radiation are dose limiting and are more likely with higher doses per treatment fraction. Protocols that use smaller doses per fraction have a lower risk of late effects thereby allowing higher total doses to be delivered which leads to higher tumour control rates. It is possible to provide long-term tumour control in cats and dogs using radiation therapy, particularly for mast cell tumours, soft tissue sarcomas, oral tumours and brain tumours in dogs and soft tissue sarcomas and skin tumours in cats. Individualization of treatments for tumours based on tumour staging and proliferative fraction should be considered, rather than making blanket assumptions about the behaviour of histologically determined tumour types. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1130,"Transcranial optogenetic stimulation for functional mapping of the motor cortex. We developed a method that uses Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) for transcranial optogenetic stimulation. This method is based on scanning a light beam over the brain, thereby photostimulating ChR2-expressing neurons in intact mice. As a proof of principle, we applied this technique to the motor cortex of transgenic mice expressing ChR2 in cortical pyramidal cells. Photostimulation induced limb movements that were time-locked with millisecond precision and could be induced at frequencies up to 20 Hz. By scanning this light beam, we could map the distribution of neurons associated with limb movement. With this approach we could simultaneously define motor maps controlling two limbs and could reproducibly generate such cortical motor maps over periods of weeks. This method allows non-invasive mapping of brain circuitry in living animals and could help define the connection between behavior and brain circuitry.",Excluded
1263,"Treating the contents and not the container: Dosimetric study of hair-sparing whole brain intensity modulated radiation therapy. Hematogenous metastatases are the most common adult central nervous system malignancies. The standard treatment of these patients continues to include whole brain radiation. An unavoidable toxicity of this treatment is acute iatrogenic alopecia. This alopecia is a significant cause of patient distress. Our purpose was to quantify the sparing of the hair bearing skin that could be achieved by using a complex hair-sparing approach. To achieve this goal, we treat an anthropomorphic phantom with both conventional and inverse-planned intensity-modulated portals. The skin dose was evaluated through dose-volume histograms and thermo-luminescent dosimetry. The median calculated dose was reduced by 38%. The average measured dose at five surface points was reduced by 53% - from 95% of the prescription dose with the conventional plan, to 44%, with the IMRT plan. This sparing was achieved while maintaining adequate target coverage. Because of the low radiation tolerance of the hair follicle, this dose reduction is not expected, on its own, to eliminate radiation alopecia but bears promise in combination with other toxicity-sparing strategies. ©Adenine Press (2005).",Excluded
476,"BOLD fMRI integration into radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral vascular malformations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to distinguish areas of the brain responsible for different tasks and functions. It is possible, for example, by using fMRI images, to identify particular regions in the brain which can be considered as ""functional organs at risk"" (fOARs), i.e., regions which would cause significant patient morbidity if compromised. The aim of this study is to propose and validate a method to exploit functional information for the identification of fOARs in CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) radiosurgery treatment planning; in particular, given the high spatial accuracy offered by the CyberKnife system, local nonrigid registration is used to reach accurate image matching. Five patients affected by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scheduled to undergo radiosurgery were scanned prior to treatment using computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (3DRA), T2 weighted and blood oxygenation level dependent echo planar imaging MRI. Tasks were chosen on the basis of lesion location by considering those areas which could be potentially close to treatment targets. Functional data were superimposed on 3DRA and CT used for treatment planning. The procedure for the localization of fMRI areas was validated by direct cortical stimulation on 38 AVM and tumor patients undergoing conventional surgery. Treatment plans studied with and without considering fOARs were significantly different, in particular with respect to both maximum dose and dose volume histograms; consideration of the fOARs allowed quality indices of treatment plans to remain almost constant or to improve in four out of five cases compared to plans with no consideration of fOARs. In conclusion, the presented method provides an accurate tool for the integration of functional information into AVM radiosurgery, which might help to minimize undesirable side effects and to make radiosurgery less invasive. © 2007 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
1968,"Health-related quality of life and rates of toxicity after high-dose-rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer. Purpose: High-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a common treatment option for locally advanced prostate cancer. Quality of life is an important factor when discussing therapy options for high-risk prostate cancer. This study evaluated adverse effects and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).Materials and Methods: Ninety male patients (median age, 71 years; range, 50 to 79 years) with high-risk prostate cancer underwent HDR-BT after EBRT between December 2009 and January 2017 with a median follow-up of 43 months. A total of 57 patients (69.5%) answered the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life of Cancer Patients questionnaire (QLQ-C30; ver. 3.0), and 8 patients died during follow-up. In order to put the results of this study in context, we compared the results with reference data from the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Correlations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, International Prostate Symptom Score, and HRQOL measures were calculated.Results: The study participants reported better physical functioning and better global health compared with the reference data, but worse social, role, and cognitive functioning. We found negative statistically significant correlations between the last-measured PSA value and social functioning (p>0.01), cognitive functioning, pain, and constipation (all p<0.05). Toxicity rates were 10.0% for gastrointestinal and 12.2% for genitourinary adverse effects. All reported complications for toxicity were Grade I.Conclusions: The described therapy results in high biochemical control rates with minimal adverse effects. Compared with reference groups, the HRQOL of this study cohort was acceptable. PSA values during follow-up seem to be a possible indicator to influence HRQOL.",Excluded
552,"Blocking GABAA neurotransmission in the interposed nuclei: effects on conditioned and unconditioned eyeblinks. The interposed nuclei (IN) of the intermediate cerebellum are critical components of the circuits that control associative learning of eyeblinks and other defensive reflexes in mammals. The IN, which represent the sole output of the intermediate cerebellum, receive massive GABAergic input from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and are thought to contribute to the acquisition and performance of classically conditioned eyeblinks. The specific role of deep cerebellar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning are not well understood. One group of studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN altered the time profile of conditioned responses (CRs), suggesting that the main function of the cerebellar cortex is to shape the timing of CRs. Other studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN abolished CRs, indicating a more fundamental involvement of the cerebellar cortex in CR generation. When examining this controversy, we hypothesized that the behavioral effect of GABA(A) blockers could be dose-dependent. The IN of classically conditioned rabbits were injected with high and low doses of picrotoxin and gabazine. Both GABA(A) blockers produced tonic eyelid closure. A high dose of both drugs abolished CRs, whereas a less complete block of GABA(A)-mediated inputs with substantially smaller drug doses shortened CR latencies. In addition, low doses of picrotoxin facilitated the expression of unconditioned eyeblinks evoked by trigeminal stimulation. These results suggest that the intermediate cerebellum regulates both associative and non-associative components of the eyeblink reflex, and that behavioral effects of blocking Purkinje cell action on IN neurons are related to collective changes in cerebellar signals and in the excitability of extra-cerebellar eyeblink circuits.",Excluded
2130,"[Problems and chances of high field magnetic resonance imaging]. [German]. The spatial, temporal and spectral resolution in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is in many cases currently not sufficient to detect submillimeter lesions or to image the dynamics of the beating heart. At present MRI systems at 1.5 T and 3 T are the standard units for clinical imaging. The use of ultrahigh magnetic fields of 7 T and higher increases the signal-to-noise ratio, which holds promise for a significant improvement of the spatial and/or temporal resolution as well as for new contrast mechanisms. With 7 T MRI, images of the brain have been acquired routinely with a spatial resolution of 0.3 mm. The theoretical improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is often not fully realized due to B1 inhomogeneities and contrast variations. With MRI at 7 T a notable increase in spatial resolution can be achieved. Methods such as time-of-flight MR angiography and susceptibility-weighted imaging (e.g. neurofunctional MRI, fMRI) profit especially from the higher field strengths. Transmission field inhomogeneities are still a major challenge for ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI and are also a partially unsolved safety problem. The use of UHF MRI is currently limited to special applications and the expected gain of the high field must be weighed against technical limitations in both image acquisition and interpretation.",Excluded
3617,"Quality of life in the GLARIUS trial randomizing bevacizumab/irinotecan versus temozolomide in newly diagnosed, MGMT-nonmethylated glioblastoma. Background The GLARIUS trial, which investigated the efficacy of bevacizumab (BEV)/irinotecan (IRI) compared with standard temozolomide in the first-line therapy of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-nonmethylated glioblastoma, showed that progression-free survival was significantly prolonged by BEV/IRI, while overall survival was similar in both arms. The present report focuses on quality of life (QoL) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) during the whole course of the disease. Methods Patients (n = 170) received standard radiotherapy and were randomized (2:1) for BEV/IRI or standard temozolomide. At least every 3 months KPS was determined and QoL was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Core Quality of Life and 20-item Brain Neoplasm questionnaires. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model evaluated differences in the course of QoL and KPS over time. Also, the time to first deterioration and the time to postprogression deterioration were analyzed separately. Results In all dimensions of QoL and KPS, GEE analyses and time to first deterioration analyses did not detect significant differences between the treatment arms. At progression, 82% of patients receiving second-line therapy in the standard arm received BEV second-line therapy. For the dimensions of motor dysfunction and headaches, time to postprogression deterioration was prolonged in the standard arm receiving crossover second-line BEV in the vast majority of patients at the time of evaluation. Conclusions GLARIUS did not find indications for a BEV-induced detrimental effect on QoL in first-line therapy of MGMT-nonmethylated GBM patients. Moreover, GLARIUS provided some indirect corroborative data supporting the notion that BEV may have beneficial effects upon QoL in relapsed GBM. Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To develop and investigate a set of biophysical models based on a mechanically coupled reaction-diffusion model of the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor growth after radiation therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Post-radiation therapy response is modeled using a cell death model (M<sub>d</sub>), a reduced proliferation rate model (M<sub>p</sub>), and cell death and reduced proliferation model (M<sub>dp</sub>). To evaluate each model, rats (n = 12) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI at 7 time points over 2 weeks. Rats received either 20 or 40 Gy between the third and fourth imaging time point. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to estimate tumor cell number within enhancing regions in contrast-enhanced MRI data. Each model was fit to the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor cell number from time point 1 to time point 5 to estimate model parameters. The estimated model parameters were then used to predict tumor growth at the final 2 imaging time points. The model prediction was evaluated by calculating the error in tumor volume estimates, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number.RESULTS: For both the rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gy, significantly lower error in tumor volume, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number was observed for the M<sub>dp</sub> and M<sub>p</sub> models compared with the M<sub>d</sub> model. The M<sub>dp</sub> model fit, however, had significantly lower sum squared error compared with the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>d</sub> models.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that for both doses, the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>dp</sub> models result in accurate predictions of tumor growth, whereas the M<sub>d</sub> model poorly describes response to radiation therapy.",Excluded
122,"Plasma membrane nanoporation as a possible mechanism behind infrared excitation of cells. OBJECTIVE: Short infrared (IR) laser pulses have been used to stimulate action potentials in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon has remained elusive. In vitro studies have found that pulsed IR exposure generates a nearly instant change in capacitance in the plasma membrane, characterized by inward rectification, a common feature in pore-forming exposures, such as electrical pulses and acoustic shock waves. Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that the mechanism of IR stimulation is the formation of short-lived nanopores in the plasma membrane. These transient, small-diameter pores allow the influx of extracellular ions that lead to action potential generation, possibly through activation of secondary messenger pathways or depolarization of the cell membrane resulting in activation of voltage-gated ion channels.APPROACH: A variety of fluorescent markers are used to observe the cell response to IR stimulation to monitor for effects indicative of nanoporation in other modalities.MAIN RESULTS: We observe rapid, transient rises in intracellular Ca(2+), influx of YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide into the cell signifying membrane permeabilization, cellular blebbing and swelling, and activation of the intracellular phosphoinositides lipid signaling pathway.SIGNIFICANCE: This conclusion better explains the experimental observations and limitations of IR-induced neurological stimulation and represents a distinct theoretical shift in the understanding of the mechanism of IR-induced stimulation.",Excluded

After the first day of exposure, LPO increased in the eyestalks and brains of the UV-exposed animals; ACAP, and CAT, GPX and GST activities also increased in the brains. On the third day, the LPO values in the eyestalk remained high in the UV-exposed groups, while ACAP decreased in the brain and eyestalk and CAT activity remained high in all irradiated groups in both regions. On the fifth day, LPO decreased in the eyestalk and brain of the UV-exposed groups. These results may have been a consequence of the antioxidant defense system (ADS) activity, since CAT activity was high in both regions, ACAP was high in the eyestalks of the SIM group, and GPX activity remained high in the eyestalks of the UVA and UVB groups.

Purpose/Objective(s): The centrally located lesion for lung cancer presents a clinical challenge for stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) due to its potential severe toxicities. The optimal regimen remains unclear. We seek to investigate the clinical outcome and toxicities of SABR for central located stage I or isolated recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials/Methods: One hundred one patients with 101 central lesions, defined as being located within 2 cm of the bronchial tree, major vessels, esophagus, heart, tracheal, pericardium, mediastinal pleural and brachial plexus and vertebral body, but having no direct invasion, Stage I (n = 82), and isolated recurrent (n = 19) NSCLC, were treated with image-guided SABR to 50 Gy in four fractions or 70 Gy in ten fractions. Toxicity was scored according to the CTCAE V3.0. Result(s): With a median follow-up period of 27.5 months (range, 9.0-81.8 months), the local control rates were 98.0%, 96.1% at 2 years and 3 years respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 71.0% and 57.5%, respectively. Although the most common side effect was radiation pneumonitis (RP), there was no G4 or G5 RP with current dose volume constraints (40 Gy <1 cc for the bronchial tree). A total of 18.8% had G2 RP and 2.0% had G3 RP. Dosimetric factors V5- V20, mean lung dose (MLD) of ipsilateral lung were associated with RP on univariate analysis. Three percent developed radiation brachial plexus neuropathy; the maximum brachial plexus doses of these patients were 38- 43 Gy in 4 fractions. One patient, with tumor invading hilum who was treated with SABR 70 Gy in 10 fx to PTV, died from hemoptysis one year later. Analysis showed that significant portions of pulmonary vessels received doses of 70 to 80 GY. Conclusion(s): SABR for central lung tumors resulted in high local control and acceptable toxicity when appropriate dose volume constraints were applied. Keeping brachial tree/pulmonary vessel dose 40 Gy <1 cc in 4 fractions appears safe in avoiding G4 or 5 RP. Maximal dose >38 Gy in 4 fractions to the brachial plexus was associated with neuropathy.

INTRODUCTION: Carcinoid tumors belong to the group of neuroendocrine tumors whose cells are part of the APUD system, with the place of origin being most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract (more often the appendix). Pulmonary involvement can be seen in about 0.5 % to 2% with no difference between gender, usually in patients above 60 years old, with no correlation with smoking, radiation or chemicals. It may have prognostic variables, from the kindness of a tumor without local infiltration to metastatic and life threatening tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: MAS, male, 25 years old, resident of interior of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, workman. Six years before our first consultation, the patient presented minor bleeding with probable origin in the respiratory tract, considered initially a nasal origin. Sporadic, with no relation to climate change, physical exertion or other triggering factors. Denied other signs or symptoms. Was requested chest and sinus radiography, without alterations. Requested a CT of the chest which showed consolidation with aerobronchograms located in the apical and anterior segment of the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests without relevant findings, with negative bacillus alcohol acid resistant, culture for M. tuberculosis in sputum and serum tests for fungi. We opted for conservative treatment. Two years after the initial event, he searched pulmonology service for monitoring, and it was requested new chest CT, which showed nodule with partial bronchial obstruction and onset of the consolidation in the adjacent parenchyma. Again, the position assumed was to maintain observation of the evolution of the framework due to the absence of clinical expression. Elapsed two more years, he presented episodes of bleeding associated with cough and sneezing, more intensely. Searched otolaryngologist who requested laryngoscopy, which showed no abnormalities that could justify the symptoms. He was then referred to our clinic and brought all previously obtained material, including a new request of chest CT. He referred hemoptoics, progressive dyspnea and wheezing. Denied fever, purulent sputum expectoration, weight loss or other constitutional symptoms. Ordered additional tests including ESR (51mm ), DHL (217 UI/L), PCR (26mm ) , CEA (1.4 ng / dL), negative serology for fungi, noreactive Mantoux test. Pulmonary function tests: FVC: 2.36(46%)-2.43(47% )-(change 3%), FEV<inf>1</inf>:1.59(37%)-1.83 (43 %)-(change15%), FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC:67% - 75%, DLCO 23,8( 1%). The previously requested tomography brought showed nodule of 3.9 cm in the left lower lobe with soft tissue attenuation, promoting partial bronchial obstruction and leading to areas of adjacent consolidation. With these results, it was requested bronchoscopy. Evolved unfavorably with intensification of the bleeding, which made us chose hospitalization for monitoring. Bronchoscopy revealed tumor mass partially obstructing the left lower lobe bronchus, infiltratating with bleeding lips. Before the results of the histopathological analysis, he evolved with intensified bleeding, with risk of death.Referred to thoracic surgery. Performed left lower lobectomy, which was uneventful and he had complete recovery. The analysis of material obtained through fiberoptic bronchoscopy as part of the surgery proved to be a typical carcinoid tumor. DISCUSSION: Carcinoid tumors represent 1% to 2 % of cancers affecting the lung, with higher incidence in age above 60 years. Presents an indolent growth and may remain asymptomatic for several years, with the first manifestations being the presence of hemoptysis and dyspnea.It can produce metastasis, leading to carcinoid syndrome, characterized by a systemic clinical picture. For diagnosis it should take into account the correlation of imaging tests and biopsy either via endoscopic or thoracotomy, depending on the location of the tumor or the physician's choice. The curative treatment is done surgically with resection of the tumor. CONCLUSION(S): Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are rare and should be part of the differential diagnosis of lung neoplasms with nonspecific manifestations. When diagnosed, it has a favorable prognosis. The treatment of choice is surgical resection.",Excluded

A large variability of paired-pulse plasticity (PPP) has been reported in CA3-CA1 synapses, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) has long been extensively used as a relative index of release probability (P(r)) from the presynaptic terminal. One of the most common ways of studying P(r) and PPP is to pass paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) through an electrode to fire an action potential (AP), which in turn opens Ca(2+) channels in the presynaptic boutons to evoke transmitter release. However, when the postsynaptic responses were elicited by electrical stimulations, the presynaptic APs were usually not monitored. The reliability of presynaptic activation, the difference of AP firing thresholds between the first and the second pulses of PPS, and its relationship with P(r) and PPP have been largely ignored. Here we show that the AP firing thresholds in the same CA3 pyramidal cells (axons) are obviously lower for the second pulses of the PPS than for the first pulses. When single (or small numbers of) presynaptic axons were stimulated by low-intensity PPS, a large variation in the postsynaptic response probability of the first pulses (P(res1)) and PPP was observed. Increasing stimulation intensities resulted in the conversion of a lower P(res1) and PPF to a higher P(res1) and paired-pulse depression. These results indicate that changes in the reliability of AP initiation by the first pulse of the PPS may account for the high variability of P(res1) and PPP observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, therefore PPF may not be a reliable index of P(r) .",Excluded
259,"The correlation between serum apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio and brain necrosis in patients underwent radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Introduction: The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) ratio is recognized as a clinical indicator of cardiovascular disease and ischemic cerebral disease. Cerebrovascular dysfunction is also involved in head and neck radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between ApoB/ApoA1 ratio and the severity of radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) in patients who underwent radiotherapy after nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): In this retrospective study, 191 NPC patients diagnosed with RN were evaluated. Clinical characteristics, serum lipid, apolipoproteins, and brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were collected. Serum lipid and apolipoproteins were quantified using standard diagnostic assays, and the quality of life (QOL) was assessed by the World Health Organization quality of life abbreviated instrument (WHOQOL-BREF). Result(s): ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was positively correlated with lesion volume (r =.18, p =.03) and negatively correlated with WHOQOL-BREF scores (r = -.28, p <.01). The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were independent risk factor of RN volume. Moreover, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was significantly negatively correlated with physical health (r = -.29, p <.01), psychological (r = -.27, p <.01), social relationships (r = -.17, p =.02), and environment (r = -.27, p <.01) domains of WHOQOL-BREF. Conclusion(s): Serum ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is positively correlated with RN volume, which indicated serum ApoB/ApoA1 ratio as an independent risk factor for lesion volume in patients with RN after radiotherapy for NPC, suggesting a bright intervention target in RN treatment.

754,"Light affects mitochondria to cause apoptosis to cultured cells: possible relevance to ganglion cell death in certain optic neuropathies. Retinal ganglion cell axons within the globe are laden with mitochondria that are unprotected from light (400-760 nm) impinging onto the retina. Light can be absorbed by mitochondrial enzymes such as cytochrome and flavin oxidases causing the generation of reactive oxygen species, and we have suggested this may pose a risk to ganglion cell survival if their energy state is compromised, as may be so in glaucoma or in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Here, we demonstrate that light (400-760 nm) provokes apoptosis in cultured retinal ganglion-5 cells, and that this effect is enhanced in low serum, and attenuated by various antioxidants. Apoptosis is shown to be caspase independent, involving reactive oxygen species generation and the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and apoptosis-inducing factor. We further show that light-induced apoptosis requires the participation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This was demonstrated by culturing fibroblasts (BJhTERT cells) in ethidium bromide for 40 days to deplete their mitochondrial DNA and perturb their mitochondrial respiratory chain function (BJhTERT rh0 cells). Only BJhTERT cells, with intact mitochondrial respiratory chain function were affected by light insult. Finally, we show that exposure of anaesthetized pigmented rat eye to white, but not red light, causes changes in the expression of certain retinal mRNAs (neurofilament light, Thy-1 and melanopsin) and optic nerve proteins (neurofilament light and tubulin), suggesting that ganglion cell survival is affected. Our findings support the proposal that the interaction of light, particularly the blue component, with intra-axonal ganglion cell mitochondria may be deleterious under certain circumstances, and suggest that reducing the light energy impinging upon the retina might benefit patients with certain optic neuropathies.",Excluded

3360,"Radio frequency radiation-related cancer: assessing causation in the occupational/military setting. BACKGROUND AND AIM: We reexamine whether radio frequency radiation (RFR) in the occupational and military settings is a human carcinogen.METHODS: We extended an analysis of an already-reported case series of patients with cancer previously exposed to whole-body prolonged RFR, mainly from communication equipment and radar. We focused on hematolymphatic (HL) cancers. We used analysis by percentage frequency (PF) of a cancer type, which is the proportion of a specific cancer type relative to the total number of cancer cases. We also examined and analyzed the published data on three other cohort studies from similar military settings from different countries.RESULTS: The PF of HL cancers in the case series was very high, at 40% with only 23% expected for the series age and gender profile, confidence interval CI95%: 26-56%, p<0.01, 19 out of 47 patients had HL cancers. We also found high PF for multiple primaries. As for the three other cohort studies: In the Polish military sector, the PF of HL cancers was 36% in the exposed population as compared to 12% in the unexposed population, p<0.001. In a small group of employees exposed to RFR in Israeli defense industry, the PF of HL cancers was 60% versus 17% expected for the group age and gender profile, p<0.05. In Belgian radar battalions the HL PF was 8.3% versus 1.4% in the control battalions as shown in a causes of deaths study and HL cancer mortality rate ratio was 7.2 and statistically significant. Similar findings were reported on radio amateurs and Korean war technicians. Elevated risk ratios were previously reported in most of the above studies.CONCLUSIONS: The consistent association of RFR and highly elevated HL cancer risk in the four groups spread over three countries, operating different RFR equipment types and analyzed by different research protocols, suggests a cause-effect relationship between RFR and HL cancers in military/occupational settings. While complete measurements of RFR exposures were not available and rough exposure assessments from patients interviews and from partial exposure data were used instead, we have demonstrated increased HL cancers in occupational groups with relatively high RFR exposures. Our findings, combined with other studies, indicate that exposures incurred in the military settings evaluated here significantly increased the risk of HL cancers. Accordingly, the RFR military exposures in these occupations should be substantially reduced and further efforts should be undertaken to monitor and measure those exposures and to follow cohorts exposed to RFR for cancers and other health effects. Overall, the epidemiological studies on excess risk for HL and other cancers together with brain tumors in cellphone users and experimental studies on RFR and carcinogenicity make a coherent case for a cause-effect relationship and classifying RFR exposure as a human carcinogen (IARC group 1).",Excluded

81,"Growth of beta-amyloid(1-40) protofibrils by monomer elongation and lateral association. Characterization of distinct products by light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Amyloid plaques in brain tissue are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Primary components of these plaques are 40- and 42-residue peptides, denoted A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42), that are derived by proteolysis of cellular amyloid precursor protein. Synthetic A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) form amyloid fibrils in vitro that share many features with the amyloid in plaques. Soluble intermediates in A beta fibrillogenesis, termed protofibrils, have been identified previously, and here we describe the in vitro formation and isolation of A beta(1-40) protofibrils by size exclusion chromatography. In some experiments, the A beta(1-40) was radiomethylated to better quantify various A beta species. Mechanistic studies clarified two separate modes of protofibril growth, elongation by monomer deposition and protofibril-protofibril association, that could be resolved by varying the NaCl concentration. Small isolated protofibrils in dilute Tris-HCl buffers were directed along the elongation pathway by addition of A beta(1-40) monomer or along the association pathway by addition of NaCl. Multi-angle light scattering analysis revealed that protofibrils with initial molecular masses M(w) of (7-30) x 10(3) kDa grew to M(w) values of up to 250 x 10(3) kDa by these two growth processes. However, the mass per unit length of the associated protofibrils was about 2-3 times that of the elongated protofibrils. Rate constants for further elongation by monomer deposition with the elongated, associated, and initial protofibril pools were identical when equal number concentrations of original protofibrils were compared, indicating that the original number of protofibril ends had not been altered by the elongation or association processes. Atomic force microscopy revealed heterogeneous initial protofibrils that became more rodlike following the elongation reaction. Our data indicate that protofibril elongation in the absence of NaCl results from monomer deposition only at the ends of protofibrils and proceeds without an increase in protofibril diameter. In contrast, protofibril association occurs in the absence of monomer when NaCl is introduced, but this association involves lateral interactions that result in a relatively disordered fibril structure.",Excluded

LEDs are also used in TVs, computers, smart phones, and tablets. Although the light emitted by most LEDs appears white, LEDs have peak emission in the blue light range (400-490 nm). The accumulating experimental evidence has indicated that exposure to blue light can affect many physiologic functions, and it can be used to treat circadian and sleep dysfunctions. However, blue light can also induce photoreceptor damage. Thus, it is important to consider the spectral output of LED-based light sources to minimize the danger that may be associated with blue light exposure.

1754,"Risk Factor Analysis for Newly Developed Urogenital Dysfunction after Total Mesorectal Excision and Impact of Pelvic Intraoperative Neuromonitoring-a Prospective 2-Year Follow-Up Study. AIM: Urogenital dysfunction is a common sequela following total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This prospective study analyzed potential risk factors and investigated the impact of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring.METHOD: Included were 85 patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, 43 under the control of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring. Urogenital function was assessed with validated questionnaires within a 2-year follow-up period. Potential risk factors were identified by multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Overall, approximately one-third of treated patients suffered from new onset of urinary dysfunction. Initially, half of the sexually active patients were affected by sexual dysfunction; after 2 years, almost three quarters were affected. In the pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring group, urinary and sexual dysfunction rates including minor and major disturbances were significantly lower (2-year follow-up 20% vs. 51% (p = 0.004) and 56% vs. 90% (p = 0.010)). Throughout the survey, non-performance of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring was found to be an independent risk factor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was identified as an independent predictor for urogenital dysfunction in the further course one and 2 years after surgery.CONCLUSION: Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and sexual dysfunction in the short and long run, whereas neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has a negative impact only in the long run.",Excluded
2772,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC. For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded
622,"More than skin deep. Introduction: A 47-year-old female without significant past medical history presented to her PCP with complaints of generalized pruritus for 3 weeks. She had previously been evaluated at an urgent care facility where she was given a course of steroids for her symptoms. Although she had brief improvement with prednisone, her symptoms returned after the course ended. She denied any other systemic symptoms specifically weight loss, fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She had recently noticed darkening of her urine and possible jaundice, but stated this seemed to be improving. Her physical exam was notable for jaundice without evidence of chronic liver disease. Her abdomen was soft , non-tender, and she had no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation showed AST 166 IU/L, ALT 90 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.4 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase of 401 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse dilation of intrahepatic ducts and a 1.5-cm common bile duct (CBD), as well as 4.8 x 6.7 cm heterogeneous mass in the gallbladder with a second similarly enhancing lesion seen at the distal CBD. The pancreas appeared normal. An ERCP was performed which revealed a polypoid appearing mass within the distal bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and this was biopsied after eversion into the duodenal lumen. Initial differential included biliary cystadenoma/ adenocarcinoma versus atypical cholangiocarcinoma versus lymphoma or IPMN of the bile ducts. However, biopsy specimen showed pigmented deposition on H&E stain with subsequent positive staining for S-100 and HMB proteins consistent with melanoma. Unfortunately, a staging MRI of the brain showed evidence of metastatic lesions. Thorough skin, eye, and mucosal examination did not reveal evidence of a primary lesion, and a CT-PET scan showed large, hypermetabolic lesions in the gallbladder and distal bile duct without evidence of other primary source. Therefore, our final diagnosis is primary biliary melanoma with metastatic disease to the brain. Only 10 other cases of primary biliary melanoma have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is based on stage of disease at presentation with surgical resection providing the best chance for survival. Unfortunately, our patient had metastases present at diagnosis and was not a candidate for surgery. In the 6 months since diagnosis, she has been treated with radiation and Anti-CTLA 4 therapy and is undergoing evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials.",Excluded
1071,"Solar ultraviolet-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, 1993-2002. BACKGROUND: An inverse relationship between solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure and non-skin cancer mortality has long been reported. Vitamin D, acquired primarily through exposure to the sun via the skin, is believed to inhibit tumor development and growth and reduce mortality for certain cancers.METHODS: We extend the analysis of this relationship to include cancer incidence as well as mortality, using higher quality and higher resolution data sets than have typically been available. Over three million incident cancer cases between 1998 and 2002 and three million cancer deaths between 1993 and 2002 in the continental United States were regressed against daily satellite-measured solar UV-B levels, adjusting for numerous confounders. Relative risks of reduced solar UV-B exposure were calculated for thirty-two different cancer sites.RESULTS: For non-Hispanic whites, an inverse relationship between solar UV-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality was observed for ten sites: bladder, colon, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, other biliary, prostate, rectum, stomach, uterus, and vulva. Weaker evidence of an inverse relationship was observed for six sites: breast, kidney, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, and small intestine. For three sites, inverse relationships were seen that varied markedly by sex: esophagus (stronger in males than females), gallbladder (stronger in females than males), and thyroid (only seen in females). No association was found for bone and joint, brain, larynx, liver, nasal cavity, ovary, soft tissue, male thyroid, and miscellaneous cancers. A positive association between solar UV-B exposure and cancer mortality and incidence was found for anus, cervix, oral cavity, melanoma, and other non-epithelial skin cancer.CONCLUSION: This paper adds to the mounting evidence for the influential role of solar UV-B exposure on cancer, particularly for some of the less-well studied digestive cancers. The relative risks for cancer incidence are similar to those for cancer mortality for most sites. For several sites (breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, other biliary, vulva), the relative risks of mortality are higher, possibly suggesting that the maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels is more critical for limiting tumor progression than for preventing tumor onset. Our findings are generally consistent with the published literature, and include three cancer sites not previously linked with solar UV-B exposure, to our knowledge: leukemia, small intestine, and vulva.",Excluded
481,"Iatrogenic radiation exposure from neuroimaging may increase the risk of cancer and mortality in patients with epilepsy. Objective:To calculate the dosage of radiation exposure of a series of patients with epilepsy and determine if this affects their estimated risk of developing cancer. Background(s): Patients with epilepsy frequently receive head imaging. Data from other populations demonstrates that radiation exposure such as that received in imaging studies may increase the risk of certain cancers and overall mortality. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed radiation exposure from imaging studies for the prior 5 years for 50 consecutive adult patients seen in a tertiary epilepsy. The original studies where reviewed to directly calculate the radiation exposure for each exam. Brain dose and bone marrow dose from SPECT, CT, FDG-PET was calculated based on published models. Result(s): The mean brain dose was 9.1 mGy and the mean bone marrow dose was 2.3 mGy. According to Pearce's mode this amount of radiation exposure doubles the risk of developing brain cancer or leukemia and by the BEIR Committee's formula, increase the risk of death from cancer by approximately 28 in 1,000,000 over the baseline risk of 2,000/1,000,000. Among the 50 patients, 17 of them had scans of either SPECT and/or CT and/or PET. These 17 patients had an average if 26.7 mGy of brain exposure and 6.8. mGy of bone marrow exposure. The highest brain exposure was 80 mGy, while the highest bone marrow exposure was 30.4 mGy. By Pearce's mode, these individuals may have up to a 3 fold increase in the risk of later developing brain tumors or leukemia. Conclusion(s): Patients with epilepsy may be at increased risk of developing fatal cancers from radiation exposure from common imaging procedures. Neurologists caring for patients with epilepsy should be judicious in ordering studies that expose patients to radiation. Population based studies are needed to see if an increased prevalence of cancer is seen in persons with epilepsy.",Excluded

2109,"Feasibility and utility of re-treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE in GEP-NENs relapsed after treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC. Purpose: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid therapy for grade 1/2 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). Although a median progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 20 months is frequently observed, the majority of patients relapse after 2 - 3 years. In the present study, we investigated the use of low dosage re-treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE (Lu-PRRT) in patients with GEP-NENs who relapsed after treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC (Y-PRRT). Method(s): Upon tumour progression, 26 patients with a PFS of at least 12 months after Y-PRRT were consecutively enrolled in a phase II study of re-treatment with Lu-PRRT. All patients had preserved kidney and haematological parameters and received 14.8 - 18.5 GBq of Lu-PRRT in four or five cycles. The disease control rate (DCR), toxicity, PFS and prognostic factors were evaluated. Result(s): Median total activity of Lu-PRRT was 16.5 GBq in five cycles. The DCR was 84.6 %, median PFS was 22 months (95 % CI 16 months - not reached) compared to 28 months (95 % CI 20 - 36 months) after Y-PRRT. Tumour burden and number of liver metastases were important prognostic factors. Toxicity was mild after Lu-PRRT re-treatment in the majority of patients, with only two patients with grade 2 and one with grade 3 bone marrow toxicity; one patient had grade 2 and one grade 3 renal toxicity. Conclusion(s): Patients with GEP-NEN who have previously responded to Y-PRRT are suitable candidates for Lu-PRRT re-treatment on progression. Although our sample size was limited, low-dosage Lu-PRRT was safe, and led to DCR and PFS rates comparable with those observed when Y-PRRT was used as primary treatment.

1733,"Phase 1/2 study of dianhydrogalactitol (VAL-083) with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, mgmt-unmethylated glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer. Current standard-of-care includes surgery followed by chemoradiation and temozolomide. An unmethylated promoter for O6-methylguanine- DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is a validated biomarker for temozolomide-resistance and is strongly correlated with poor outcomes. Unmethylated MGMT represents the majority of newly diagnosed GBM tumors. VAL-083 is a first-in-class bi-functional DNA-targeting agent that has shown activity against GBM in NCI-sponsored clinical trials both as single agent and in combination with radiotherapy. VAL-083 induces interstrand cross-links at N7-guanine, leading to DNA double-strand breaks and cell-death. VAL-083s unique mechanism-of-action circumvents MGMT-mediated chemoresistance, and it has demonstrated cytotoxicity in MGMT-unmethylated GBM cell-lines, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in vivo models. Furthermore, VAL-083 acts as a radiosensitizer in GBM CSCs and non-CSCs. We completed a dose-escalation trial of VAL-083 in recurrent GBM, and a generally well-tolerated dosing regimen was selected for further clinical development. The present trial is an ongoing open-label, biomarker-driven, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed MGMTunmethylated GBM patients.

3065,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mRNA and protein expression in large versus small diameter dorsal root ganglion neurons: correlation with hyperpolarization-activated current gating. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) are responsible for the functional hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We studied HCN1-4 channel mRNA and protein expression and correlated these findings with I(h) functional properties in rat DRG neurons of different size. Quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) analysis demonstrated that HCN2 and HCN1 mRNAs were more abundantly expressed in large diameter (55-80 microm) neurons, while HCN3 mRNA was preferentially expressed in small diameter (20-30 microm) neurons. HCN4 mRNA expression was very low in neurons of all sizes. At the protein level, subunit-selective polyclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence indicated that HCN1 and HCN3 are present in large diameter neurons and small diameter neurons. Staining in small diameter neurons was in IB4-positive (non-peptidergic) and IB4-negative (peptidergic) cells. HCN2 immunofluorescent staining was heterogeneous and predominantly in large diameter neurons and in small diameter IB4-negative neurons. HCN4 was poorly expressed in all neurons. Functionally, I(h) amplitude and density were significantly larger, and activation kinetics faster, in large diameter neurons when compared with small neurons. I(h) activation rates in small and large diameter DRG neurons were consistent with the relative abundance of HCN subunits in the respective cell type, considering the reported HCN channel activation rates in heterologous systems (HCN1>HCN2 approximately HCN3>HCN4), suggesting exclusivity of roles of different HCN subunits contributing to the excitability of DRG neurons of different size. Additionally, a functional role of I(h) in small DRG neuron excitability was evaluated using a computational model.",Excluded
266,"Radiation target delineation of micro brain arteriovenous malformations using highresolution flat-detector cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Purpose Radiation therapy has shown to be an effective treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs).1 2 Target delineation is commonly performed on volumetric image data, such as MRI or CT data. However, the nidi of micro-AVMs may not be visualized adequately by these modalities due to their limited image resolution. In this report, we show a novel usage of high-resolution contrastenhanced cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and multi-modal image registration<sup>3</sup> for radiation target delineation of a micro-AVM, a technique previously suggested for larger AVMs.4 Case A 42-year-old male presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the mesencephalic tectum and left posterior thalamus. Conventional angiography revealed a left superior collicular AVM with a nidus of 3mm. The AVM was successfully embolized but follow-up angiography examinations at 36 months demonstrated a small re-growth of the AVM (Abstract P-017 figure 1A). The patient was thus referred to radiosurgery. Thin slice contrast and non-contrast MRI acquired for target delineation did not show the AVM nidus. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the angiography suite for high resolution contrast-enhanced CBCT. Data was acquired using the angiography c-arm system with a reduced detector size of 22 cm. Contrast was injected with 2 ml/s for a total of 64 ml and a 2 sec delay) using a coupled power injector into the left vertebral artery with a 5Fr catheter. Volumetric CBCT data (FOV: 70<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix: 0.14<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>) was generated using a nonbinned reconstruction algorithm. Lesion and nidus were visualized with CBCT. MRI, CT-simulator and CBCT data was then transferred to the radiation planning software and mutually co-registered. The nidus was delineated on CBCT data by an experienced neurointerventional radiologist for radiation therapy and dose/ treatment plan was completed. Due to image registration, the target area could be directly transferred to MRI and CT data (Abstract P-0017 figure 1B). The patient received a total of 4 radiation sessions. Discussion and Conclusion Radiation target delineation of micro AVMs can be challenging with conventional 3D imaging techniques as their spatial resolution is relatively low for the application of visualization of the nidus. We were able to demonstrate the complementary value of high resolution contrast enhanced CBCT in radiation target delineation of a micro brain AVM. Multi-modal image registration of CBCTwith MRI and CT-simulator has shown to be an effective method for radiation target delineation. (Figure presented).",Excluded

Immunocompromised mice are an essential tool for human xenotransplantation studies, including human haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology research. Over the past 35 years, there have been many advances in the development of these mouse models, offering researchers increasingly sophisticated options for creating clinically relevant mouse-human chimeras. This addendum article will focus on our recent development of the ""NSGW"" mouse, which, among other beneficial traits, is genetically modified to obviate the need for myeloablative irradiation of the animals. Thus, the complicating haematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and neurological side effects associated with irradiation are avoided and investigators without access to radiation sources are enabled to pursue engraftment studies with human HSCs. We will also discuss the topics of transgenics, knock-ins, and other mutants with an overarching goal of enhancing chimerism in these animal models.",Excluded
3052,"Improved plan quality with automated radiotherapy planning for whole brain with hippocampus sparing: a comparison to the RTOG 0933 trial. BACKGROUND: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) with hippocampus sparing (HS) has been investigated by the radiation oncology working group (RTOG) 0933 trial for patients with multiple brain metastases. They showed a decrease of adverse neurocognitive effects with HS WBRT compared to WBRT alone. With the development of automated treatment planning system (aTPS) in the last years, a standardization of the plan quality at a high level was achieved. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an aTPS for the treatment of HS WBRT and see if the RTOG 0933 dose constraints could be achieved and improved.METHODS: Ten consecutive patients treated with HS WBRT were enrolled in this study. 10 x 3 Gy was prescribed according to the RTOG 0933 protocol to 92% of the target volume (whole-brain excluding the hippocampus expanded by 5 mm in 3-dimensions). In contrast to RTOG 0933, the maximum allowed point dose to normal brain was significantly lowered and restricted to 36.5 Gy. All patients were planned with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique using four arcs. Plans were optimized using Auto-Planning (AP) (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems) with one single AP template and optimization.RESULTS: All the constraints from the RTOG 0933 trial were achieved. A significant improvement for the maximal dose to 2% of the brain with a reduction of 4 Gy was achieved (33.5 Gy vs. RTOG 37.5 Gy) and the minimum hippocampus dose was reduced by 10% (8.1 Gy vs. RTOG 9 Gy). A steep dose gradient around the hippocampus was achieved with a mean dose of 27.3 Gy at a distance between 0.5 cm and 1 cm from the hippocampus. The effective working time to optimize a plan was kept below 6'.CONCLUSION: Automated treatment planning for HS WBRT was able to fulfil all the recommendations from the RTOG 0933 study while significantly improving dose homogeneity and decreasing unnecessary hot spot in the normal brain. With this approach, a standardization of plan quality was achieved and the effective time required for plan optimization was minimized.",Excluded

Pulse bursts of microwave energy were used to stimulate resonant-type acoustical response in a rectangular muscle-equivalent model and in a spherical brain-equivalent model. The rectangular model was irradiated using a military radar transmitter at 5.655 GHz, 200 kW peak, and the spherical model was irradiated using a pulse-type cavity oscillator at 1.10 GHz, 4 kW peak. Hydrophone transducers were implanted in the models to record the microwave-induced mechanical vibrations. Four properly timed radar pulses produced a threefold increase in the acoustical amplitudes in the muscle model. In the spherical model, a pulse train of three properly timed microwave pulses doubled the stress wave amplitudes as recorded by the implanted hydrophone. These results show that certain pulse parameters of microwave irradiation can be adjusted to increase the intensity of induced mechanical vibrations in both rectangular and spherical tissue equivalent models.",Excluded
1966,"Radiotherapy of painful vertebral hemangiomas: the single center retrospective analysis of 137 cases. PURPOSE: An evaluation of dose-response relationship and an attempt to define predictive factors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 137 cases of painful vertebral hemangioma irradiations (101 patients). Fraction dose (fd) varied from 2 to 15 Gy (123 fractionated and 14 radiosurgical treatments), and total dose (TD) from 8 to 30 Gy (111 cases irradiated with fd of 2 GY to TD of 24 Gy). We evaluated pain relief, changes in analgesic requirements, and reossification.RESULTS: Means of pain relief 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after radiotherapy (defined as a decrease of primary pain level expressed in percent) were 60.5%, 65.4%, 68.3%, and 78.4%, respectively. Proportion of patients with no need for analgesics and patients using tramadol were 39%, 40%, 44%, 57%, and 20%, 17%, 22%, and 11% in these times. The proportion of patients experiencing complete/partial pain relief changed from 36/48% 1 month, to 64/22% 1.5 years after radiotherapy. No impact of radiotherapy on reossification was found. The positive impact of fd and TD increase for analgesics uptake reduction and pain relief was found. An increase of the fd by 1 Gy results in 27% chance of analgesics uptake reduction and 3.8% reduction of pain, whereas 14% analgesics uptake reduction and 2.2% of pain reduction in case of the TD. The predictive factors improving results were found: female gender, older age, better performance states (the chance of the lower analgesic treatment decreases over 2.5 times in comparison to the higher Zubrod degree), bigger Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data support the efficacy of radiotherapy in improving pain secondary to vertebral hemangioma, with the degree of pain amelioration being related to increasing fd and TD. The positive predictive factors were defined: female gender, older age, better performance status, increased Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration, and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To test the acute effects of the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine (GFC) on motor excitability in intact humans.METHODS: Eight healthy right-handed adults received a single oral dose of 2 mg of GFC. Motor cortex excitability was tested by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand area of the left motor cortex. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. In addition, spinal and neuromuscular excitability were tested. All measures were obtained immediately before GFC intake (baseline), and 2, 6, and 24 h later.RESULTS: GFC decreased the slope of the MEP intensity curve, increased paired-pulse short-interval intracortical inhibition, and decreased paired-pulse intracortical facilitation and I-wave facilitation. These effects were maximal at 2-6 h and returned to baseline at 24 h. Motor threshold, cortical silent period, and the measures of spinal (peripheral silent period, F waves) and neuromuscular excitability (maximum M wave) remained unaffected.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the effects of an anti-noradrenergic drug on human motor cortex excitability. GFC reduced cortical excitability by disfacilitation and increased inhibition. These findings support the idea that anti-noradrenergic drugs are detrimental for cortical plasticity and learning which are down-regulated by disfacilitation or increased inhibition.",Excluded
3256,"Photoreceptor damage and eye pigmentation: influence on the sensitivity of rat pineal N-acetyltransferase activity and melatonin levels to light at night. The threshold of light irradiance capable of inhibiting nighttime pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin content, and the importance of intact photoreceptors and eye pigmentation on these changes, were investigated in the rat. Groups of intact albino and black-eyed rats and albino animals with light-induced photoreceptor damage were studied in the dark period before, and after 15 and 30 min of exposure to either 0.0005, 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2 irradiance of light. In animals with photoreceptor damage, the sensitivity of the pineal gland to light decreased so that only the highest irradiance tested (3.33 microW/cm2) was capable of totally inhibiting pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels. In one study, pineal NAT and melatonin levels in intact albino rats were inhibited by all three irradiances studied. In a second experiment, albino and black-eyed animals behaved identically, only responding with a depression in pineal NAT and melatonin after exposure to light irradiances of either 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2. In conclusion, the lowest irradiance of cool white light capable of inhibiting pineal NAT and melatonin in albino rats is around 0.0005 microW/cm2. At the irradiances studied, photoreceptor damage influences the response of pineal NAT and melatonin to acute light exposure at night. On the other hand, eye pigmentation does not seem to have a major effect on the nighttime inhibition of the pineal by light.",Excluded

High-energy radiation bombardment of intact frozen telencephalon resulted in a biphasic inactivation curve for [3H]AMPA binding. At a 5.8-Mrad radiation dose, the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding was increased (54 nM), but there was no apparent alteration in the Bmax value (2.76 pmol/mg of protein). We attribute this phenomenon to the inactivation of a high molecular weight modulatory protein that down-regulates the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding. The estimated molecular masses of the AMPA binding site and of the modulatory component were 59 and 108 kDa, respectively. Solubilisation with n-octyl-beta-glucopyranoside resulted in an increase in the Bmax (4.7 pmol/mg of protein) with no pronounced alteration in the affinity (109 nM) of [3H]AMPA binding. However, the solubilisation-induced increase in Bmax did not occur in telencephalon irradiated before solubilisation. In contrast, the increase in affinity induced by radiation treatment was still detected in solubilised extracts. These results suggest that the number and affinity of [3H]AMPA sites in chick telencephalon are closely regulated and that the modulatory systems involved are affected by both irradiation and solubilisation.",Excluded

Many studies have reported on vulnerable areas of the brain in hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HI-BI). However, little is known about the involvement of neural tracts following HI-BI. We investigated neural tract injuries in adult patients with HI-BI, using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Twelve consecutive patients with HI-BI and 12 control subjects were recruited for this study. We classified the patients into two subgroups according to the preservation of alertness: subgroup A-5 patients who had intact alertness and subgroup B-7 patients who had impaired alertness. DTI-Studio software was used for evaluation of seven neural tracts: corticospinal, cingulum, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and optic radiation. We measured the DTT parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient and voxel number) of each neural tract. In the individual analysis, all 12 patients showed injuries in all 24 neural tracts in terms of both DTT parameters and integrity, except for the corticospinal tract (75.0% injury). In the group analysis, the patient group showed neural injuries in all 24 neural tracts. In comparison of subgroups A and B, subgroup B showed more severe injuries: subgroup B showed a higher rate of disruption (39.8%) than subgroup A (12.9%) on individual DTTs and subgroup B had more severe injuries in both the cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. In conclusion, we found that extensive injuries in the neural tracts were accompanied by HI-BI. Patients with impaired alertness appeared to show more severe injuries of neural tracts. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

To determine whether this phase-dependent activation of c-Fos persists in an acute in vitro preparation, we prepared horizontal slices of hamster ventral hypothalamus, electrically stimulated the still-attached optic nerves, recorded the resulting evoked potentials in the SCN, and examined c-Fos protein levels in the nucleus by immunohistochemistry. The number of SCN cells labeled for immunoreactive c-Fos was significantly increased in slices stimulated during projected night, but not during projected day, compared to matched, sham-stimulated control slices. These results imply that the phase-dependent mechanism that gates c-Fos photoinduction in vivo is intrinsic to SCN tissue, and they suggest that an in vitro slice preparation will provide a useful model for dissecting the responsible signal transduction elements.",Excluded

The C57BL/6J mouse has been a useful model of presbycusis, as it displays an accelerated age-related peripheral hearing loss. The medial olivocochlear efferent feedback (MOC) system plays a role in suppressing cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) responses, particularly for background noise. Neurons of the MOC system are located in the superior olivary complex, particularly in the dorsomedial periolivary nucleus (DMPO) and in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB). We previously discovered that the function of the MOC system declines with age prior to OHC degeneration, as measured by contralateral suppression (CS) of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in humans and CBA mice. The present study aimed to determine the time course of age changes in MOC function in C57s. DPOAE amplitudes and CS of DPOAEs were collected for C57s from 6 to 40 weeks of age. MOC responses were observed at 6 weeks but were gone at middle (15-30 kHz) and high (30-45 kHz) frequencies by 8 weeks. Quantitative stereological analyses of Nissl sections revealed smaller neurons in the DMPO and VNTB of young adult C57s compared with CBAs. These findings suggest that reduced neuron size may underlie part of the noteworthy rapid decline of the C57 efferent system. In conclusion, the C57 mouse has MOC function at 6 weeks, but it declines quickly, preceding the progression of peripheral age-related sensitivity deficits and hearing loss in this mouse strain.",Excluded
541,"Anacardic acid induces caspase-independent apoptosis and radiosensitizes pituitary adenoma cells. OBJECT: Pituitary adenomas, which are common intracranial tumors, are associated with significant patient morbidity due to hormone secretion or mass effect or as a complication of therapy. Epigenetic regulation has emerged as an important component of malignant tumor pathogenesis, although the contribution in the progression of benign pituitary tumors remains largely unexplored. The present study evaluates the effect of anacardic acid (6-pentadecyl salicylic acid), a natural histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, on pituitary adenoma cells.METHODS: The concentration- and time-dependent effects of anacardic acid on the viability of GH3 and MMQ pituitary adenoma cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle phase distribution, protein expression, and percentage of apoptotic cells were assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Colony forming assays were used to study the radiosensitizing effect of anacardic acid.RESULTS: The present study identifies a novel antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of anacardic acid on pituitary adenoma cells. These effects were associated with an increase in poly([adenosine diphosphate]-ribose) polymerase cleavage, sub-G1 arrest, and annexin V staining, consistent with apoptotic cell death; however, the pancaspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone failed to reverse anacardic acid-induced cell death, suggesting a possible nonclassical apoptotic mechanism. Anacardic acid also reduced the expression of survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, antiapoptotic proteins associated with cellular survival and radioresistance, and radiosensitized pituitary adenoma cells.CONCLUSIONS: These findings warrant further exploration of anacardic acid as a single agent or as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary tumors.",Excluded

We made in vivo whole cell patch-clamp recordings from the inferior colliculus of young-adult, anesthetized C57/Bl6 mice to compare the responses to constant-current injections with the responses to tones of different duration or to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones. We observed that voltage-dependent ion channels contributed in several ways to the response to tones. A sustained response to long tones was observed only in cells showing little accommodation during current injection. Cells showing burst-onset firing during current injection showed a small response to SAM tones, whereas burst-sustained cells showed a good response to SAM tones. The hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation channel I(h) had a special role in shaping the responses: I(h) was associated with an increased excitability, with chopper and pauser responses, and with an afterhyperpolarization following tones. Synaptic properties were more important in determining the responses to tones of different durations. A short-latency inhibitory response appeared to contribute to the long-pass response in some cells and short-pass and band-pass neurons were characterized by their slow recovery from synaptic adaptation. Cells that recovered slowly from synaptic adaptation showed a relatively small response to SAM tones. Our results show an important role for both intrinsic membrane properties -- most notably the presence of I(h) and the extent of accommodation -- and synaptic adaptation in shaping the response to tones in the inferior colliculus.",Excluded

Diastereomeric 8,5'-cyclopurine 2'-deoxynucleosides, containing a covalent bond between the deoxyribose and the purine base, represent an important class of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. The 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine lesion (cdG) has been recently reported to be a strong block of replication and highly mutagenic in Escherichia coli. The 8,5'-cyclopurine-2'-deoxyriboses are suspected to play a role in the etiology of neurodegeneration in xeroderma pigmentosum patients. These lesions cannot be repaired by base excision repair, but they are substrates for nucleotide excision repair. The structure of an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing a site-specific S-cdG lesion placed opposite dC in the complementary strand was obtained by molecular dynamics calculations restrained by distance and dihedral angle restraints obtained from NMR spectroscopy. The S-cdG deoxyribose exhibited the O4'-exo (west) pseudorotation. Significant perturbations were observed for the beta, gamma, and chi torsion angles of the S-cdG nucleoside. Watson-Crick base pairing was conserved at the S-cdG.dC pair. However, the O4'-exo pseudorotation of the S-cdG deoxyribose perturbed the helical twist and base pair stacking at the lesion site and the 5'-neighbor dC.dG base pair. Thermodynamic destabilization of the duplex measured by UV melting experiments correlated with base stacking and structural perturbations involving the modified S-cdG.dC and 3'- neighbor dT.dA base pairs. These perturbations may be responsible for both the genotoxicity of this lesion and its ability to be recognized by nucleotide excision repair.",Excluded
3021,"The sensitivity of light-evoked responses of retinal ganglion cells is decreased in nitric oxide synthase gene knockout mice. We have shown previously that increasing the production of nitric oxide (NO) results in a dampening of visual responses of retinal ganglion cells (G. Y. Wang, L. C. Liets, & L. M. Chalupa, 2003). To gain further insights into the role of NO in retinal function, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from ganglion cells of neural type nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene knockout mice. Here we show that in the dark-adapted state, the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cell to light stimulation is decreased in nNOS knockout animals. The lowest light intensities required to evoke optimal responses and the average intensities that evoked half-maximal responses were significantly higher in nNOS knockouts than in normal mice. Retinal histology and other features of light-evoked responses of ganglion cells in nNOS mice appeared to be indistinguishable from those of normal mice. Collectively, these results, in conjunction with our previous work, provide evidence that increasing levels of NO dampen visual responses of ganglion cells, while a lack of nNOS decreases the sensitivity of these neurons to light. Thus, NO levels in the retina are capable of modulating the information that ganglion cells convey to the visual centers of the brain.",Excluded

Result(s): The qualitative data indicated a need for information on the following: types of cancer; treatments and side-effects; practical issues; dealing with changes in personality and behaviour; palliative care; communication strategies. Preferred pathways for information included both video and online material, and a central contact person within the health system. These issues were subsequently used to inform the online survey. This data revealed that the top 5 most endorsed needs were information relating to: diagnosis; symptoms and side effects (seizures, fatigue); managing personality and behavioural changes; current research and advances in treatment; staying fit (diet, nutrition).

A total of 15 patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL were consecutively enrolled in this study. Comparing the NCF scores between the baseline (before WBRT) and post-treatment (after combined chemoradiation therapy) intervals (Mean=122.33days, SD=34.49, range = 77-196), neurobehavioral outcomes consistently remained improving or stable in almost each domain of NCF. Specifically, the scores on Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-Revised (PASAT-R) were significantly improved between the baseline and post-chemoradiation assessment.

In addition to MRI the new RANO criteria also take clinical parameters, such as steroid medication and neurological symptoms, into account.

3590,"Urinary, anorectal and sexual assessment after pelvic cancer surgery. Urinary, anorectal and sexual complications are often observed after pelvic cancer surgery. These symptoms may be secondary to a tumor compression or a specific surgical trauma of autonomic and somatic pathways involved in the bladder, bowel and sexual control. Indeed, pelvic organs are very close and share the same innervation, which plays an important role in the detrusor contraction, erectile function, pelvic floor contraction and global pelvi-perineal sensory functions. Moreover, pelvic irradiation and/or chemotherapy following specific surgery can also lead to neurogenic (myelopathy and plexopathy) lesions of centers and/or motor/sensory pathways, which control bladder and rectal functions. Specific bladder and rectal lesions secondary to irradiation are very common (chronic radiation cystitis, radiation rectitis). Sexual dysfunction from radiation therapy includes erectile dysfunction and vaginal stenosis. Urinary symptoms observed after pelvic surgery are principally characterized by voiding dysfunction with urinary retention or post void residual in case of neurogenic lesion. In some cases, overactive bladder symptoms (urge, frequency) are due to a radiation lesion of the bladder mucosa. Cystoscopy and urodynamic investigations are necessary to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms of these symptoms. Treatment of urinary retention is usually self-intermittent catherization and anticholinergic drugs can be used in case of overactive bladder. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can be used in male erectile dysfunction and vaginal dilators in case of vaginal stenosis. Perineal pain can be observed. Neurological mechanism is the main mechanism and can be confirmed by means of electrophysiological testing. This neuropathic pain can be managed by various treatments (drugs, TENS. . .).",Excluded
1363,"Rod photoreceptor dysfunction in diabetes: activation, deactivation, and dark adaptation. PURPOSE: To examine photoreceptor function in diabetes in detail by evaluating photoreceptor light activation, deactivation of the photoresponse, and recovery of the photoreceptor after bleaching (dark adaptation) in rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ).METHODS: Animals were assigned to treated and control groups. Light activation in rod photoreceptors was established using a paired-flash electroretinogram (ERG) protocol, and the leading edge of the a-wave was modeled with the mechanisms mediating phototransduction. Deactivation of the photoreceptor response was evaluated at three luminous exposures (1.4-2.2 log cd.m/s-2) using a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigm. Dark adaptation was evaluated at 90-second intervals for 30 minutes after approximately 20% pigment bleach. At each time point, a paired-flash signal (1.4 log cd.s/m-2) was used to extract rod responses.RESULTS: Diabetic animals showed decreased amplitudes of the photoreceptor response 12 weeks after diabetes induction. No difference was found in the rate of deactivation of the photoresponse in diabetic rats. Normalized amplitudes showed that diabetic animals had significantly faster dark adaptation (P<0.01) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although photoreceptor activation was abnormal, deactivation was unaltered after 12 weeks of diabetes. The faster relative recovery found in diabetes after bleach, in the presence of normal pigment dynamics, may reflect a decrease in outer segment lengths.",Excluded

With Rana temporaria, the RNA content was studied cytophotometrically in large neurons of the retina ganglionic layer and in their satellites--oligodendrocytes. Due to light stimulation, the distribution and content of RNA in large neurons and satellite glia are rather specific.

1226,"Restricting exposure to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields. A general procedure is described for application of the new ICNIRP exposure guidelines to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields below 100 kHz. The procedure involves weighting of the spectral components with a function that takes into account the basic restrictions and reference levels. A simple first-order RC response or its piecewise linear equivalent is proposed for the weighting function. The weighting can be performed either on the Fourier transformed sample of the measured signal or in real time by processing the signal with an analog or digital filter circuit. The cut-off frequency of the filter is 820 Hz. The occupational exposure criteria are exceeded when the weighted peak magnetic flux density exceeds 43 microT or equivalently the weighted peak dB/dt exceeds 0.22 T s(-1). The maximal peak exposures allowed by the proposed approach are compared with the stimulation thresholds computed with a stimulation model. The results strongly suggest that the safety margin to the stimulation is greater for non-sinusoidal than for sinusoidal waveforms, and at low frequencies it is higher than at high frequencies. The increase of the low-frequency safety margin is desirable to avoid magnetophosphenes and possible CNS effects that may occur below the level predicted by the classical nerve models. Measurement techniques and examples of measured magnetic fields are presented. Particularly high exposures were measured inside MRI equipment and anti-theft gates.",Excluded

2065,"Duration of fluoroscopic-guided spine interventions and radiation exposure is increased in overweight patients. BACKGROUND: The impact of patient body mass index (BMI) on image-guided spine interventions remains unknown. Higher BMI is known to complicate the acquisition of radiographic images. Therefore it can be hypothesized that the patient's body habitus can influence the delivery of a spinal injection.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of patient BMI on the length of fluoroscopy and procedure times during spine interventions.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 2 prospective observational studies.SETTING: All injections were performed in an outpatient university setting.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 209 patients in whom spine injections were performed (99 women), with a mean age of 54.6 years.METHODS: The fluoroscopy times for 202 participants and total procedure times for 137 participants were recorded. Additional participant characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, and actual procedures performed, also were collected. Analysis of covariance and linear and nonlinear model analysis were performed to assess the effect of BMI on fluoroscopy and procedure times.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fluoroscopy time and procedure duration times.RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 54.6 years, 51% were men, and 77% (n = 155) were overweight (BMI >=25). Participants received the following interventions: 40 zygapophyseal joint injections, 33 medial branch nerve blocks, 113 transforaminal epidural injections, and 16 combined zygapophyseal joint injections and epidural injections. Gender, procedure number, and procedure type did not differ between groups. The overweight group demonstrated a 30% increase in mean fluoroscopy time and a 35% increase in mean procedure time. Controlling for other variables, we found that differences in fluoroscopy time and procedure time were significant (P = .032 and P = .031, respectively) between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopy time in overweight patients increase the risks associated with spine interventions, not only to the patients but also to the operating room staff exposed to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
224,"Synapses in the fly motion-vision pathway: evidence for a broad range of signal amplitudes and dynamics. Synapses are generally considered to operate efficiently only when their signaling range matches the spectrum of prevailing presynaptic signals in terms of both amplitudes and dynamics. However, the prerequisites for optimally matching the signaling ranges may differ between spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. This poses a problem for synapses that convey both graded and spike signals at the same time. We addressed this issue by tracing transmission systematically in vivo in the blowfly's visual-motion pathway by recording from single neurons that receive mixed potential signals consisting of rather slow graded fluctuations superimposed with highly variable spikes from a small number of presynaptic elements. Both pre- and postsynaptic neurons were previously shown to represent preferred-direction motion velocity reliably and linearly at low fluctuation frequencies. To selectively assess the performance of individual synapses and to precisely control presynaptic signals, we voltage clamped one of the presynaptic neurons. Results showed that synapses can effectively convey signals over a much larger amplitude and frequency range than is normally used during graded transmission of visual signals. An explanation for this unexpected finding might lie in the transmission of the spike component that reaches larger amplitudes and contains higher frequencies than graded signals.",Excluded
2048,"Crossed cerebellar diaschisis after stroke identified noninvasively with cerebral blood flow-weighted arterial spin labeling MRI. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is most commonly investigated using hemodynamic PET and SPECT imaging. However, noninvasive MRI offers advantages of improved spatial resolution, allowing hemodynamic changes to be compared directly with structural findings and without concerns related to ionizing radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate relationships between CCD identified from cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI, Wallerian degeneration, clinical motor impairment, and corticospinal tract involvement.METHODS: Subjects (n=74) enrolled in an ongoing observational stroke trial underwent CBF-weighted ASL and hypercapnic CVR-weighted BOLD MRI. Hemispheric asymmetry indices for basal cerebellar CBF, cerebellar CVR, and cerebral peduncular area were compared between subjects with unilateral supratentorial infarcts (n=18) and control subjects without infarcts (n=16). CCD required (1) supratentorial infarct and (2) asymmetric cerebellar CBF (>95% confidence interval relative to controls).RESULTS: In CCD subjects (n=9), CVR (p=0.04) and cerebral peduncular area (p<0.01) were significantly asymmetric compared to controls. Compared to infarct subjects not meeting CCD criteria (n=9), CCD subjects had no difference in corticospinal tract location for infarct (p=1.0) or motor impairment (p=0.08).CONCLUSIONS: CCD correlated with cerebellar CVR asymmetry and Wallerian degeneration. These findings suggest that noninvasive MRI may be a useful alternative to PET or SPECT to study structural correlates and clinical consequences of CCD following supratentorial stroke.",Excluded
628,"Adenosine A2A receptors are essential for long-term potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. The physiological conditions under which adenosine A2A receptors modulate synaptic transmission are presently unclear. We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.",Excluded
1671,"Patient-Specific Screening Using High-Grade Glioma Explants to Determine Potential Radiosensitization by a TGF-beta Small Molecule Inhibitor. High-grade glioma (HGG), a deadly primary brain malignancy, manifests radioresistance mediated by cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms. High levels of the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in HGG promote radioresistance by enforcing an effective DNA damage response and supporting glioma stem cell self-renewal. Our analysis of HGG TCGA data and immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated Smad2, which is the main transducer of canonical TGF-beta signaling, indicated variable levels of TGF-beta pathway activation across HGG tumors. These data suggest that evaluating the putative benefit of inhibiting TGF-beta during radiotherapy requires personalized screening. Thus, we used explant cultures of seven HGG specimens as a rapid, patient-specific ex vivo platform to test the hypothesis that LY364947, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta type I receptor, acts as a radiosensitizer in HGG. Immunofluorescence detection and image analysis of gamma-H2AX foci, a marker of cellular recognition of radiation-induced DNA damage, and Sox2, a stem cell marker that increases post-radiation, indicated that LY364947 blocked these radiation responses in five of seven specimens. Collectively, our findings suggest that TGF-beta signaling increases radioresistance in most, but not all, HGGs. We propose that short-term culture of HGG explants provides a flexible and rapid platform for screening context-dependent efficacy of radiosensitizing agents in patient-specific fashion. This time- and cost-effective approach could be used to personalize treatment plans in HGG patients.",Excluded
3160,"NF-kappaB activation in light-induced retinal degeneration in a mouse model. PURPOSE: To investigate the modulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in a mouse model.METHODS: Mice were exposed to intense green light. Light-induced activation of NF-kappaB and its nuclear localization were studied by immunohistochemistry. The NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the retinas after exposure to light was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear transactivation of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells was determined by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The amount of NF-kappaB p65 in the photoreceptor cells after exposure to light was assessed by Western blot analysis. To obtain more photoreceptor-specific information, microdissected photoreceptor cells were used in some studies.RESULTS: By an immunohistochemical method, the perinuclear region of the photoreceptor cells was heavily labeled with an antibody to activated NF-kappaB after a 1-hour exposure to light. Nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor nucleus was seen at 12 hours. In the experiments involving 3 hours of exposure to light followed by recovery in the dark, nuclear localization of NF-kappaB was also noted after 12 hours' recovery in the dark. During continuous exposure to light, the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity gradually increased and reached its maximum at 12 hours. There was an increase of NF-kappaB p65 protein at 3 hours. The mRNA levels of IkappaBalpha were upregulated after 6 hours' exposure to light.CONCLUSIONS: Intense light activated NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells in vivo, increased the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, and increased the expression of mRNA of IkappaBalpha, a target gene of NF-kappaB.",Excluded

This procedure appears to be useful in major reconstructions of the dome of the skull when autografts cannot be used. A good aesthetic result is obtained by means of a single piece of bone prepared according to the site and dimensions of the skull defect. Because homografts are able to induce renewed osteogenesis, it seems preferable to use these grafts rather than non-biological materials.",Excluded
1767,"Structural analysis of the alpha N-terminal region of erythroid and nonerythroid spectrins by small-angle X-ray scattering. We used SpalphaI-1-156 peptide, a well-characterized model peptide of the alphaN-terminal region of erythrocyte spectrin, and SpalphaII-1-149, an alphaII brain spectrin model peptide similar in sequence to SpalphaI-1-156, to study their association affinities with a betaI-spectrin peptide, SpbetaI-1898-2083, by isothermal titration calorimetry. We also determined their conformational flexibilities in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) methods. These two peptides exhibit sequence homology and could be expected to exhibit similar association affinities with beta-spectrin. However, our studies show that the affinity of SpalphaII-1-149 with SpbetaI-1898-2083 is much higher than that of SpalphaI-1-156. Our SAXS findings also indicate a significantly more extended conformation for SpalphaII-1-149 than for SpalphaI-1-156. The radius of gyration values obtained by two different analyses of SAXS data and by molecular modeling all show a value of about 25 A for SpalphaI-1-156 and of about 30 A for SpalphaII-1-149, despite the fact that SpalphaI-1-156 has seven amino acid residues more than SpalphaII-1-149. For SpalphaI-1-156, the SAXS results are consistent with a flexible junction between helix C' and the triple helical bundle that allows multiple orientations between these two structural elements, in good agreement with our published NMR analysis. The SAXS findings for SpalphaII-1-149 support the hypothesis that this junction region is rigid (and probably helical) for alphaII brain spectrin. The nature of the junction region, from one extreme as a random coil (conformationally mobile) segment in alphaI to another extreme as a rigid segment in alphaII, determines the orientation of helix C' relative to the first structural domain. We suggest that this particular junction region in alpha-spectrin plays a major role in modulating its association affinity with beta-spectrins, and thus regulates spectrin tetramer levels. We also note that these are the first conformational studies of brain spectrin.",Excluded
1738,"Localization of glial aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 in the light-injured murine retina. Excessive light causes damage to photoreceptor and pigment epithelial cells, and a local edema in the outer retina. Since Muller glial cells normally mediate the osmohomeostasis in the inner retina (mainly via channel-mediated transport of potassium and water), we determined whether retinal light injury causes an alteration in the retinal localization of glial water (aquaporin-4) and potassium (Kir4.1) channels, and in the potassium conductance of Muller cells. Mice were treated with bright white light (intensity, 15,000lx) for 2h. Light treatment results in Muller cell gliosis as indicated by the enhanced staining of the glial fibrillary acidic protein and an increase in the cell membrane area reflecting cellular hypertrophy. In light-injured retinas, the immunostaining of the photoreceptor water channel aquaporin-1 disappeared along with the degeneration of the outer retina, and the outer nuclear layer contained large spherical bodies representing photoreceptor nuclei which were fused together. The immunostainings of the aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 proteins were increased in the outer retina after light treatment. Since the amplitude of the potassium currents of Muller cells remained largely unaltered, the increase in the Kir4.1 immunostaining is supposed to be caused by a redistribution of the channel protein. The data indicate that Muller glial cells respond to excessive light with an alteration in the localization of Kir4.1 and aquaporin-4 proteins; this alteration is thought to be a response to the edema in the outer retina and may support the resolution of edema.",Excluded
2829,"Palliative radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. The palliative treatment of patients with NSCLC should be individualized. Treatment decisions should be directed by the goal of maximizing the patient's quality of life, and the patient's wishes should always be ascertained. The approaches to palliative radiation treatment of the chest, bones, and brain are quite similar. Treatment of the chest and bones is usually reserved until symptoms are significant. Brain metastases are generally treated soon after diagnosis. With respect to dose- fractionation schedules, the data are not conclusive. In theory, more protracted schedules of 40 to 50 Gy in 4 to 5 weeks are associated with more durable responses and less long-term morbidity than are shorter and lower- dose schedules. These regimens are therefore worth considering for the most favorable subset of palliative patients (ie, those with good performance status and low burden of disease). At the other end of the spectrum, very ill patients with poor performance status may be best served by short hypofractionated schedules such as 20 Gy in five fractions, 17 Gy in two fractions, or possibly 8 to 10 Gy in one fraction. Response rates with these regimens are good, trips to the treatment facility are minimized, and these ill patients will probably not live long enough to experience the higher long-term toxicity rates associated with larger treatment fractions. The majority of patients, however, fall between these two extremes and are well served by schedules such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Radiation treatment fields should not be excessive but cover gross disease with a limited margin. (In the setting of brain metastases, treatment of the whole brain is recommended.) Further study of palliative treatment approaches should focus not only on assessments of response and toxicity but also on the impact of different treatments on overall quality of life.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) remains the most widely used treatment for brain metastasis (BM) from breast cancer (BC), especially for pts with multiple intracranial lesions. Growing evidence has suggested that systemic treatment can improve survival in addition to WBRT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of post- WBRT anti-HER2 and other systemic treatments on survival after BM from Her-2 positive BC. Materials/Methods: A total of 54 pts with BM from HER2-positive BC treated with WBRT in single institute between January 2006 and February 2012 was retrospectively analyzed, 42 pts (77.8%) had multiple lesions. The brain was the first metastatic site for 15 pts (27.8%). Post-WBRT anti- HER2 treatment was given in 21 pts (38.9%), 9 pts received trastuzumab, 9 pts received lapatinib and the other 3 received both trastuzumab and lapatinib. Post-WBRT chemotherapy was given in 39 pts, 19 in combination with anti-HER2 treatment. Prognostic analysis was performed including age at BM, KPS/RPA, ER/PR status, number of BM, interval between BC diagnosis and BM, presence of extracranial metastases, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT. Radiation dose of EQD2 <=40 Gy (a/s=4.6 Gy) was given in 26 pts (74.3%). Result(s): The median interval from diagnosis of BC to the identification of BM was 29 months (range, 2-136 months). In univariate analysis, age, KPS/RPA classes, number of BM, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05). While in multivariate analysis, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for OS.

2129,"Treatment for older diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is often diagnosed between ages 60 and 70 years old. The population of older adults in the United States is projected to undergo rapid growth and increased life expectancy over the coming decades; thus, cancer cases among older adults will jointly be expected to increase. Comorbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or dementia (CID), will also be more likely to be present at diagnosis of cancer in older adults and affect both treatment decision-making and prognosis. Few studies have evaluated treatment utilization patterns among older DLBCL patients with CID. Objective(s): Our objective was to describe treatment utilization patterns in older DLBCL patients with CID. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of 10 626 DLBCL patients ages 66 and older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, of whom 410 (3.9%) had CID prior to cancer diagnosis. Medicare beneficiaries with a first primary DLBCL diagnosis between 2001 and 2011 were identified. Validated algorithms utilizing administrative claims, diagnoses and procedures codes were used to identify CID and primary treatment with chemo-immunotherapy and radiation. The association between CID and receipt of treatment was determined using multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Result(s): Fewer patients with CID diagnoses received any DLBCL treatment (chemo-immunotherapy or radiation) compared with patients without CID (41% versus 65%). In multivariable models, patients with CID had significantly lower odds of any treatment (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.38-0.59). These findings were consistent for treatment with chemo-immunotherapy (OR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.35-0.55) but not radiation (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59-1.06).

Conclusion(s): In summary, patients with CID were less likely to receive chemo-immunotherapy or radiation to treat DLBCL, and multiple factors could explain this less aggressive approach taken among these older patients. It remains unclear how CID and these differences in care influence survival. Further research on patient and caregiver preferences, treatment decision-making, and alternative treatment options for older patients with comorbid lymphoma and CID is warranted.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate stochastic and deterministic risks associated with neurointerventional procedures for the patient.METHODS: Eight neurovascular interventional procedures were evaluated to determine the entrance skin dose and effective dose for the patient. Dosimetry was done with thermoluminescence dosimeters. The highest dose on the patient's head was recorded as the maximum entrance skin dose. The equivalent dose was obtained by conversion of the dose-area product using published conversion tables.RESULTS: The maximum entrance skin dose varied from 129 to 1335 mGy. The mean effective dose was 1.67 mSv with a range of 0.44 to 3.44 mSv. No deterministic effect has been encountered. Stochastic risk linked to the highest effective dose value was approximately one death by fatal cancer for every 6000 procedures, according to the new International Commission on Radiological Protection coefficient.CONCLUSIONS: Because no deterministic effect has been detected, and stochastic risks were very low, radiation hazard to the patient is a minor consideration in deciding whether to undertake a neurointerventional procedure.",Excluded

After matching of reference and acquired volume view images, set-up errors in three translation directions were recorded and corrected online before treatment each day. Mean displacements, population systematic (SIGMA), and random (sigma) errors were calculated and analyzed using SPSS (v16) software. Optimum clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin was calculated using Van Herk's (2.5SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) and Stroom's (2SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) formula.RESULTS: Patients were grouped in 4 cohorts, namely brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis. The mean vector displacement recorded were 0.18 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.36 cm, and 0.35 cm for brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis, respectively. Analysis of individual mean set-up errors revealed good agreement with the proposed 0.3 cm isotropic margins for brain and 0.5 cm isotropic margins for head-neck. Similarly, 0.5 cm circumferential and 1 cm craniocaudal proposed margins were in agreement with thorax and abdomen-pelvic cases.CONCLUSION: The calculated mean displacements were well within CTV-PTV margin estimates of Van Herk (90% population coverage to minimum 95% prescribed dose) and Stroom (99% target volume coverage by 95% prescribed dose). Employing these individualized margins in a particular cohort ensure comparable target coverage as described in literature, which is further improved if XVI-aided set-up error detection and correction is used before treatment.",Excluded

Median CKRS dose of 22 Gy was administered to median 2 targets per patient. Among 99 deaths, 14 (14%) were ND. Upfront treatment for BM included CKRS alone in 85 patients (63%), CKRS + TA in 26 patients (19%), and WBRT in 24 patients (18%). No patients or tumor related factors were associated with ND. However, the type of upfront treatment for BM was significantly associated with ND [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.57) for CKRS + TA, HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for CKRS alone] compared with the WBRT group (P = 0.01). The 2-year NDFS rates for the CKRS + TA, CRKS alone, and WBRT groups were 94%, 87%, and 78%, respectively (P = 0.03). Upfront CKRS showed significantly higher 2-year LF-free survival rate (P < 0.01). IF rate was insignificantly lower in the WBRT group compared with CKRS group (P = 0.38). Upfront CKRS + TA was associated with the best neurological outcome with high NDFS. Active brain control by early delivery of radiosurgery could achieve better neurological outcome in NSCLC with BM.",Excluded
3471,"Procoagulant and inflammatory mediators in small cell lung carcinoma: Potential role in thromboembolic complications. Background: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) patients exhibit a higher prevalence of thromboembolic complications. We hypothesized that in this malignancy, procoagulant and inflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of such complications and warfarin may down regulate these levels. Method(s): In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, patients with inoperable lung cancer (n=100) were randomized to receive chemotherapy and radiation with and without warfarin (INR 1.5 - 2.5). Blood samples were drawn prior to and after the 2nd treatment cycle with warfarin or control and retrospectively analyzed for microparticles and thrombin generation markers such as fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2). In addition, biochip array for C-reactive protein (CRP), D Dimer, neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured. The results were compared with a normal population (N=50). Result(s): The microparticles were markedly increased in the SCLC patients (3 fold increase) at baseline. Similary, the thrombin generation markers showed variable increase (1.5-3.2 fold increase). In the biochip array analysis, variable increase was noted. CRP (2.4 fold), D DIMER (11.6 fold), NSE (1.8 fold), NGAL (1.7 fold), TNFR1 (2 fold) and TM (1.3 fold) were all increased as compared to normal controls. All of the markers exhibited a decrease after warfarin treatment with a most pronounced decrease in the D Dimer and TNFR1. Conclusion(s): These results validate the hypothesis that SCLC patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state that is associated with simultaneous upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Warfarin treatment results in a down regulation of these mediators. Our results provide a rationale for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in this group of patients.",Excluded
2371,"Ophthalmologic aspects of treating optic neuropathy during the course of Graves-Basedow disease. [Polish]. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in the course of Graves' disease. Nineteen patients with neuropathy out of 520 patients with Graves' disease, including 15 women and 4 men were treated. Age of the patients ranged from 36 to 69 years, mean age was 51.3. In all patients thyroid function was normalized, 4 patients underwent strumectomy. Bi- and unilateral neuropathy was found in 13 and 6 cases respectively. The therapy consisted of high-dose steroids (Prednisone in 12 cases or Dexamethasone i.v. in 3 cases) or they were combined with gamma cobalt-60 irradiation of orbit tissues (2000 c Gy in 10 fractions) in 8 cases. In 2 cases radiotherapy alone was performed. Two cases were excluded from treatment because of optic atrophy during the first examination. In all patients full ophthalmological investigation, ultrasonography and computed tomography of the orbit before and after the treatment were performed. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 46 months, mean 21.4. Improvement of visual acuity and perimetry (p < 0.05) after the treatment was observed and changes of the fundus after the treatment were significantly (p = 0.000) improved. Exophthalmos significantly decreased (p < 0.05) but only in the right eye. In all patients the therapy reduced the ophthalmopathy index from mean 7.5 to 4.1 (p = 0.000). In conclusion: 1. Early diagnosis and appropriate, constant conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease prevent from blindness and surgical intervention. 2. Corticotherapy in combination with radiotherapy of the orbit is a beneficial method of the treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease.",Excluded
2260,"Augmented reality guidance for cerebral angiography. Purpose: Augmented reality (AR) holds great potential for IR by integrating virtual 3D anatomic models into the real world.1 In this pilot study, we developed an AR guidance system for cerebral angiography, evaluated its impact on radiation, contrast, and fluoroscopy time, and assessed physician response. Materials: In this prospective study, 9 patients with CT or MR imaging of the aorta underwent diagnostic neuroangiography with AR guidance from June to August 2017. Before each procedure, segmentation software was used to create a 3D model of the patient's aortic arch including carotid and vertebral arteries. The model was deployed to HoloLens (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), a stereoscopic optical see-Through AR head-worn display. Using the AR user interface we developed, physicians manipulated a virtual 3D model intraoperatively via voice commands, gaze, and gestures while maintaining sterility. In total, 6 physicians completed 14 postoperative questionnaires assessing the system. 18 casematched retrospective controls were identified by screening for age, aorta imaging, cone-beam CT, indication, physician, and OR. Result(s): All 9 patients underwent diagnostic neuroangiography per standard protocol with AR guidance without complication. Mean kerma-Area product 3150 muGym<sup>2</sup> (SD 2284), skin-Absorbed dose 283 mGy (SD 192), contrast volume 119 mL (SD 35), and fluoroscopy time 10 min (SD 4) were below reference values for diagnostic neuroangiography. <sup>2 3</sup> There was a non-significant reduction in kerma-Area product, skin-Absorbed dose, and fluoroscopy time compared to case-matched controls. 100% of questionnaire responses indicated physicians would recommend the AR system and felt it neither interfered with safety nor increased radiation, contrast, or procedure time. 79% indicated it helped them navigate through vasculature. 93% indicated it was useful to see the 3D model in AR. Conclusion(s): AR guidance for neuroangiography produced clinical outcomes, fluoroscopy times, and radiation doses comparable to those of conventional neuroangiography in matched controls. Results suggest that this technology is feasible and safe to use intraoperatively, offering an opportunity to enhance navigation through patient anatomy.",Excluded
1358,"Acoustic Neuroma Treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Follow-up of 335 Patients. Objective: To determine the clinical and radiologic outcome of patients with acoustic neuroma (AN) treated with linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife-based stereotactic radiosurgery with respect to tumor control, preservation of serviceable hearing, and toxicity. Method(s): A retrospective monocentric analysis including all patients who underwent single-fraction LINAC- or CyberKnife-based radiosurgery for AN between 1991 and 2015. Patient data were analyzed in terms of radiologic and clinical tumor control (no further intervention needed), treatment-related complications, preservation of serviceable hearing, and objectified hearing loss using pure tone average levels. Result(s): We included 335 patients (median age 58.2 years, treated either by LINAC-based [n = 270] or CyberKnife [n = 65] stereotactic radiosurgery). The median tumor volume was 1.1 mL (0.1-23.7 mL). The median radiation dose was 12 Gy (LINAC 12 Gy, 11-20 Gy; CyberKnife 13 Gy, 12-13 Gy) at an isodose level of 71.7% (LINAC 68.3%, 31.9%-86.2%; CyberKnife 80%, 65%-81%). The median follow-up was 30 months (LINAC 43 months, 2-224 months; CyberKnife 13 months, 4-37 months). Clinical tumor control was 98%, 89%, and 88% at 2, 5, and 10 years. The objective actuarial hearing preservation rate was 89%, 80%, and 55% at 1, 2, and 5 years. New symptoms were observed in 11.3% and classified as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1/2, apart from 4 patients (1.2%), who developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that in AN, high tumor control and considerable hearing preservation rates can be achieved by single-dose radiosurgery at low toxicity rates, resulting in a positive impact on long-term clinical outcome.

2036,"Similarity pattern analysis in mutational distributions. The validity and applicability of the statistical procedure - similarity pattern analysis (SPAN) - to the study of mutational distributions (MDs) was demonstrated with two sets of data. The first was mutational spectra (MS) for 697 GC to AT transitions produced with eight alkylating agents (AAs) in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. The second was a recently summarized data on the distributions of 11562 spontaneous, radiation- and chemical-induced forward mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa. They were analyzed as large two-way contingency tables (CTs) where two kinds of profiles were compared: site (or genotypic class) profiles and origin (or mutagen) profiles. To measure similarity (homogeneity) between any pair of profiles, the relevant sufficient statistics, Kastenbaum-Hirotsu squared distance (KHi<sup>2</sup>), was used. Collapsing the similar profiles into distinct internally homogeneous clusters named 'collapsets' revealed their similarity pattern. To facilitate the procedure, the computer program, COLLAPSE, was elaborated. The results of SPAN for the lacI spectra were found comparable with the results of their previous analysis with two multivariate statistical methods, the factor and cluster analyses. In the ad-3 data set, five collapsets were revealed among origin profiles (OPs): (I) ENU=4NQO=4HAQO=FANFT=SQ18506; (II) AF-2=EI=MMS=DEP; (III) ETO=UV; (IV) AHA=PROCARB; and (V) He ions=protons. Moreover, the previous observation that MDs are dose-dependent was confirmed for X-ray-induced MDs. Profiles induced with the low doses of X-rays are similar to that induced with <sup>85</sup>Sr, and profiles induced with the medium X-ray doses to those induced with protons and He ions. Evaluated similarities appear to be rather reasonable: mutagens with similar mode of action induce similar MDs. Similarity pattern revealed among genotypic class profiles (GCPs) seems to be also interpretable. When supplemented with descriptive cluster analysis, SPAN appears to be a fruitful methodology in MS analysis. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
2397,"Melatonin receptor density in Area X of European starlings is correlated with reproductive state and is unaffected by plasma melatonin concentration. Several of the song control nuclei of songbirds, including HVc (higher vocal center) and Area X, contain melatonin receptor (MelR). In laboratory-housed male starlings, the densities of MelR in Area X change markedly according to reproductive state. MelR are down-regulated when starlings are photostimulated (in full breeding condition) and are subsequently up-regulated when starlings become photorefractory (reproductively quiescent). However, seasonal regulation of MelR densities in Area X has only been investigated during the light phase of the light:dark cycle. Variation in MelR densities are physiologically relevant only if they also occur during the dark phase, when melatonin is present in the circulation. Brains from male starlings that were in different reproductive states but exposed to the same 18L:6D photoperiod were collected during either the mid-point of the light phase or the dark phase. Melatonin receptor distribution was assessed in vitro by 125Iodomelatonin (IMEL) receptor autoradiography. All photostimulated birds exhibited down-regulation of MelR in Area X, and all photorefractory birds exhibited high MelR density in Area X, regardless of time of sampling or plasma melatonin concentration. Thus, within each reproductive state, MelR density in Area X did not differ over the course of a circadian cycle. The functional significance of seasonal regulation of MelR in this song control nucleus remains unclear, but it is likely to involve a release of cellular inhibition by melatonin during photostimulation, with possible consequences for song learning, memory consolidation or regulation of the context of song production.",Excluded
1083,"Antegrade transapical branched aortic arch endograft-a feasibility study in pigs. Background: To describe the technique and proof the concept of a complete transapical deployment of a single sidebranch arch endograft in a porcine model. Method(s): Eight domestic pigs were operated with antegrade transapical delivery of a single-sidebranch arch endograft including a mating stentgraft to the innominate artery. Technical feasibility, operating time, radiation parameters and hemodynamic changes were studied according to standardized protocol during baseline (T0), after establishing of the transapical access and through-and-through wire (T1) and after stent-graft deployment (T2). Myocardial and cerebral perfusion were assessed by fluorescent-microspheres (FM) and transit-time-flow measurement (TTFM). Result(s): Transapical access, introduction and deployment of the endograft, sidebranch catheterization and deployment of the mating stent-graft were feasible in 6 of the 8 animals with unimpeded perfusion of the innominate artery. One animal was lost during transapical access, one during sire-branch catheterization. The mean operating and fluoroscopy times were 157+/-47min and 15.9+/-3.2min. During introduction and deployment of the stent-graft transient aortic valve insufficiency occurred in all animals. Hemodynamic stability recovered within ten minutes after retrieval of the delivery system in all animals. The innominate artery was patent with unchanged TTFM-flow measurements throughout the procedure. FM evaluation revealed stable myocardial and cerebral perfusion. Conclusion(s): Antegrade transapical access to the aortic arch for implantation of a single sidebranch arch endograft is feasible in a porcine model with reversible impact on hemodynamic measures during deployment. Transapical access allows for deployment of a complex endograft through a single large bore access-site in a porcine model. It might be a future treatment option for selective patients.",Excluded
1262,"Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow velocity and intracellular motility using dynamic light scattering-optical coherence tomography. This paper describes a novel optical method for label-free quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracellular motility (IM) in the rodent cerebral cortex. This method is based on a technique that integrates dynamic light scattering (DLS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), named DLS-OCT. The technique measures both the axial and transverse velocities of CBF, whereas conventional Doppler OCT measures only the axial one. In addition, the technique produces a three-dimensional map of the diffusion coefficient quantifying nontranslational motions. In the DLS-OCT diffusion map, we observed high-diffusion spots, whose locations highly correspond to neuronal cell bodies and whose diffusion coefficient agreed with that of the motion of intracellular organelles reported in vitro in the literature. Therefore, the present method has enabled, for the first time to our knowledge, label-free imaging of the diffusion-like motion of intracellular organelles in vivo. As an example application, we used the method to monitor CBF and IM during a brief ischemic stroke, where we observed an induced persistent reduction in IM despite the recovery of CBF after stroke. This result supports that the IM measured in this study represent the cellular energy metabolism-related active motion of intracellular organelles rather than free diffusion of intracellular macromolecules.",Excluded
909,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients. Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: The purpose is to describe the method, safety and efficacy of transperineal gold seed placement for image-guided radiation therapy.METHODS: An ethics committee approved database was used to review records of consecutive patients from October 2008 through December 2013, who underwent transperineal implantation of three gold markers into the prostate using staged local anaesthesia and transrectal ultrasound. Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV matching in 556/581 patients (95.7%). The procedure was aborted due to pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2 patients, <0.5%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5%). There were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1 patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation. The mean visual analogue pain score associated with transperineal gold seed insertion met patients' expectations (respectively 4.1 vs. 4.4 P = 0.19).CONCLUSION: Outpatient transperineal insertion of fiducials avoids the rectum, is effective, convenient, well tolerated and has few side effects.",Excluded
3168,"Comparison of the efficacy and safety of tropisetron, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine in the treatment of emesis associated with far advanced cancer. BACKGROUND. A single institution, prospective, randomized trial was performed in terminal cancer patients to compare tropisetron (TRO), metoclopramide (MET), and chlorpromazine (CHL) in the management of nausea and emesis. Patients had far advanced cancer, were far removed from chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and their nausea and emesis was not due to bowel obstruction, drug intake, or cranial, electrolytic, or metabolic causes. The effects of antiemetic treatments were evaluated from Days 1-15. METHODS. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomized to receive 1) MET+ dexamethasone (DEX) (10 mg*4 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 2) TRO (5 mg*l, orally), 3) TRO + MET (5 mg*l and 10 mg*2, respectively, orally), 4) TRO + MET + DEX (5 mg*l, 10 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 5) CHL + DEX (25 mg*2 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 6) TRO + CHL (5 mg*l and 12.5 mg*2, respectively, orally), or 7) TRO + CHL + DEX (5 mg*l, 12.5 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally). Total control was defined as no nausea or emesis. RESULTS. By the end of the 15th day, total control of emesis was obtained in 23.6% (9 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 78.9% (30 of 38) of TRO patients, 84.2% (32 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 92.3% (36 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 33.3 (13 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 84.6% (33 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 92.5% (37 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. Total control of nausea was achieved in 18.4% (7 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 65.7% (25 of 38) of TRO patients, 73.6% (28 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 87.1% (34 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 17.9% (7 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 74.3% (29 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 85% (34 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. When comparing MET + DEX versus TRO; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL; and CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX, significant differences were noted. All antiemetic drugs were well tolerated with no severe side effects observed in any treatment arm. C0NCLUSIONS. These data suggest that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as tropisetron clinically are more effective in the control of emesis of patients with far advanced cancer than previously used agents.

2411,Aortic arch injection with C-arm cone beam CT for radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Technical note. Background: C-arm cone beam CT (CBCT) with selective intra-arterial contrast injection combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is currently used for the evaluation and treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In some instances an AVM will derive its blood supply from more than one main cervical artery (carotid and/or vertebral artery) and a single-vessel injection will not adequately demonstrate the entire AVM nidus. Method(s): Three patients with cerebral AVM in whom the entire nidus could not be visualized by injection of a single cervical artery are reported. CBCT dataset acquisition was performed by intra-arterial contrast injection in the ascending thoracic aorta through a 5 F pigtail catheter. The injection of diluted iodinated contrast agent (35%) lasted 22 s at a rate of 8 ml/s for a total volume of 176 ml (61.6 ml of contrast agent). The dataset was then processed using standard reconstruction methods. Result(s): Contrast injection in the ascending aorta during a single CBCT acquisition provided a volumetric dataset adequate for subsequent radiosurgical treatment planning. Conclusion(s): This is a safe and effective angiographic technique for the acquisition of volumetric datasets using CBCT that are suitable for treatment planning of intracranial AVMs deriving their blood supply from more than one major cervical artery. This technique allows imaging of the entire AVM nidus during a single CBCT acquisition.,Excluded
445,"I-125 brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma photographic and angiographic abnormalities: the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study: COMS Report No. 30. OBJECTIVES: (1) To summarize the protocol used for grading features of postradiation abnormalities from fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms of patients enrolled in the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS); (2) to document the prevalence of features of interest in the posterior pole of these eyes during 8 years of follow-up; and (3) to investigate baseline patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics associated with posterior pole features.DESIGN: Observational case series within a randomized, multicenter clinical trial.PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated 650 patients who were assigned to and received iodine-125 brachytherapy in the COMS for medium-sized tumors.METHODS: Color fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms were taken at baseline and 2, 5, and 8 years; 30 features were graded according to a standard protocol.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence at selected time intervals of fundus photographic features associated with retinopathy and optic neuropathy.RESULTS: The percentage of patients with >/=1 feature of interest was 49.2% at baseline, 84.4% at 2 years, 91.2% at 5 years, and 90.7% at 8 years. The most frequent findings across all follow-up examinations were macular microaneurysms (75.6% of examinations), macular angiographic leakage (75.1%), and optic disc hyperfluorescence (62.8%). The median number of features present increased significantly with each follow-up to a maximum of 7 features at 8 years. The prevalence of neovascularization of the disc at 5 years was 5.2%. The prevalence of optic neuropathy at 5 years was 27.4%. Prognostic factors for more prevalent and severe posterior pole abnormalities were diabetes, tumor location close to both optic nerve and foveal avascular zone, and greater dose of radiation to the foveola and optic nerve head.CONCLUSIONS: The amount and severity of retinopathy and optic neuropathy after iodine-125 brachytherapy increased through 8 years of follow-up. Assessment of photographs and angiograms taken in accord with a standard protocol provided reliable estimates of rates of development of features of retinopathy and optic neuropathy in eyes treated using the COMS brachytherapy protocol. Our findings support earlier reports that tumor factors in addition to radiation treatment may contribute to posterior pole abnormalities.FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.",Excluded
1300,"P76.82 Osimertinib versus First-Generation EGFR-TKIs in Untreated EGFR-Mutant NSCLC with Brain Metastasis: 362 Real-World Cases. Introduction: Osimertinib showed superior efficacy to first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) among untreated advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the phase III FLAURA study. However, relevant real-world data in patients with baseline brain metastasis (BM) as well as the clinical value of upfront cranial local therapy (CLT) remain scarce. Method(s): Untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with BMs receiving first-line Osimertinib or first-generation EGFR-TKIs at our cancer center were retrospectively enrolled. Progression-free survival (PFS), intracranial PFS (iPFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated in the entire cohort and patient groups created by propensity score matching (PSM). Survival outcomes and pattern of treatment failure were also investigated in patient subgroups stratified by the status of BMs, which was classified as oligo-BM (number<=3 and size<=3cm) and multiple-BM (number>=4 or size>3cm). Result(s): Among the 362 patients enrolled, 265 received first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib=196, Erlotinib=69) and the rest 97 received Osimertinib. Patients receiving first-line Osimertinib had more (p<0.001) and larger BMs (p=0.011) than those receiving first-generation EGFR-TKIs. With a median follow-up of 17.1 months (range, 2.6-73 months), median PFS and OS was 14.6 months and 31 months, respectively. Patient groups (Osimertinib=97, first-generation group=97) were created by PSM with balanced clinic-pathological parameters, and iPFS (32.5 vs 8.4 months, p<0.001), PFS (34.7 vs 11.5months,p<0.001) and OS (40.6 vs 23.8 months, p=0.041) were significantly longer in the Osimertinib group (Figure a-c). Upfront CLT, including surgery, whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS), was performed in 129 patients before disease progression and it prolonged iPFS and PFS, but not OS, in the entire cohort. Among patients with baseline oligo-BMs (n=195), upfront CLT (dominated by SRS) improved iPFS (HR=0.443, p=0.001), PFS (HR=0.373, p<0.001) and OS (HR=0.795, p=0.035) (Figure d-f), which was not the case among patients with baseline multiple-BMs. Pattern of failure analyses indicated that more patients with baseline multiple-BMs turned into the status of oligo-BMs at the maximal response to EGFR-TKIs (p=0.023) and less patients developed progressive disease in the central nervous system (p=0.019) among patients receiving upfront CTL than those didn't. Of note, 8 patients with oligo-BMs but didn't receive upfront CLT developed multiple progressive disease in the brain. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study with considerable sample size verifying the superior efficacy of first-line Osimertinib treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC with BMs. Additionally, upfront brain SRS was recommended for those with oligo-BMs. Keywords: Brain metastasis, osimertinib, cranial radiotherapy Copyright © 2021",Excluded

Of 277 with evaluable samples (D + EP, 151; EP, 126), PD-L1 expression was low (5% and 22% of pts with expression >=1% in tumour (TC) and immune cells (IC), respectively). Evaluating PD-L1 expression as a continuous variable in either TC or IC indicated no significant impact of PD-L1 on Tx effect between arms for OS (P = 0.54 and 0.23, respectively); nor for PFS and ORR. Progression patterns were similar, although fewer pts developed new lesions at first progression with D + EP vs EP (41.4% vs 47.2%), including lung lesions (8.6% vs 15.2%). The incidence of new brain/CNS metastases was similar between arms (11.6% vs 11.5%), despite PCI allowance in the control arm only. Baseline PRO scores were comparable across all symptoms and functional domains. TTD was longer across all PROs for D + EP (favourable HRs, many with upper 95% CIs <1; Table 1). [Table presented] Conclusion(s): D + EP provided significant OS benefit over EP alone, while preserving QoL and increasing the time to worsening of symptoms and functioning. PD-L1 expression was low and did not appear to be a predictive biomarker for D + EP. Clinical trial identification: NCT03043872 (release date: February 6, 2017).

1447,"Comparison of different radiation types and irradiation geometries in stereotactic radiosurgery. Recent interest in stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial lesions, and the development of stereotactic irradiation techniques has led to the need for a systematic and complete comparison of these methods. A method for conducting these comparisons is proposed and is applied to a set of currently-used stereotactic radiosurgical techniques. Three-dimensional treatment planning calculations are used to compare dose distributions for several different radiation types and irradiation geometries. Calculations were performed using charged particles (H, He, C, and Ne ions) and the irradiation geometry currently used at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Photons in the Gamma Knife configuration and the Heidelberg Linac arc method are used. The 3-dimensional dose distributions were evaluated by means of dose-volume histograms and integral doses to the target volume and to normal brain. The effects of target volume, shape and location are studied. The charged particle dose distributions are more favorable than those of the photon methods. The differences between charged particles and photons increase with increasing target volume. The differences between different charged particle species are small, as are the effects of target shape and location.",Excluded

At Austin Health, we decided to perform a CT dose audit to review the CT dose trend and the effect NDRL has had at this practice. Method Retrospective data collection of CTDIvol and DLP values of procedures for 2 years prior to NDRL and 3 years post NDRL were taken. The following non-contrast procedures were audited, CT brain, CT chest, CT abdomen/pelvis and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis scans. Data was collected across 4 CT scanners and their median of the spread per year was taken as the facility reference level (FRL) as defined in the Arpansa National Diagnostic Reference Level Service Fact Sheet. The FRL was then compared with the NDRL values. Results Preliminary results indicate a dose reduction over time since 2009 for most procedures, which may be attributed to dose optimisation, CT technology and the establishment of NDRL as a benchmark for CT dose comparison. Conclusion Regular CT dose audits are useful in managing dose trends and dose optimisation. It can be seen that since the implementation of the NDRL in 2011, there has been a positive trend towards lowering radiation dose associated with CT at this facility.",Excluded
3314,"Variation of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer birefringence in normal human subjects. PURPOSE: The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) exhibits linear birefringence due to the oriented cylindrical structure of ganglion cell axons. The birefringence (Deltan) depends on the density and composition of axonal organelles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution of birefringence around the optic nerve head (ONH) in normal subjects.METHODS: Birefringence was calculated along circular scan paths around the ONH as Deltan = R/T, where R is RNFL retardance measured by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and T is RNFL thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT scans on a 3.4 mm diameter circle were obtained from 26 normal subjects aged 18 to 53 years. Scans on circles with various diameters were obtained from 17 of these subjects.RESULTS: The average reproducibility of Deltan measured on three separate days in four subjects was +/- 0.05 nm/microm. In most subjects Deltan varied significantly along a circular path around the ONH, with maxima in superior and inferior bundles, minima temporally and nasally, and a mean of 0.32 +/- 0.03 nm/microm. Deltan profiles on circles of different diameter were similar, suggesting that Deltan did not vary along nerve fiber bundles.CONCLUSIONS: RNFL birefringence varies with position around the ONH. This variation may result from known structural differences among nerve fiber bundles that serve different retinal regions. Constant Deltan along bundles is consistent with this hypothesis. Measurements of RNFL birefringence may provide a means to detect early subcellular changes in glaucoma.",Excluded

Healthy volunteers' bone system investigation was performed before and after 105 days experiment in an isolated environment (MARS-105) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Volumetric bone mineral density (VBMD), bone mineral density (BMD), structural parameters of radius and tibia were evaluated. There were no significant BMD changes revealed in skeletal parts critical in terms of biomechanical properties. pQCT examination noted microarchitecture deterioration of radius that was reflected in decreasing of trabecular number and increasing of bone tissue inhomogeneity. Decreasing VBMD both cortical and trabecular bone were revealed for tibia. Unexpectedly, increasing oftrabecular number and decreasing of inhomogeneity were revealed for tibia. Experiment showed that only the complex investigation including DXA and pQCT measurements gives an idea about bone system changes under simulated experiment conditions.",Excluded
2273,"Use of 2-deoxy-D[1-11C]glucose for the determination of local cerebral glucose metabolism in humans: variation within and between subjects. The deoxyglucose technique for the measurement of local cerebral glucose metabolism (LCMRgl) has been widely applied in animals utilizing 14C-deoxyglucose and in humans employing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Repeat studies in humans over a relatively brief period of time have not been possible because of the 110-min half-life of fluorine-18. With the synthesis of 11C-deoxyglucose it has now become possible to utilize this short-lived (20 min) tracer for the measurement of LCMRgl and to determine its variability within subjects over a 2-h period. The kinetic rate constants for 11C-deoxyglucose were determined for gray and white matter and found to be very similar to those for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, suggesting that these two analogues of glucose have similar affinities for the facilitated transport system and are similar substrates for hexokinase in the brain. The coefficient of variation of repeated measurements of LCMRgl in a series of six normal subjects was 5.5% to 8.7% for various gray matter structures and 9.7% and 14.0% for white matter structures. The pattern of cerebral metabolic rates is relatively constant in a given individual when the conditions of the study are unchanged. The ability to make repeat measurements in the same subject reduces the variance due to between-subject differences, allowing smaller changes in LCMRgl to be detected with confidence.",Excluded
2709,"Intraoperative pulmonary embolism during craniotomy: A case report. Background: Acute intraoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, yet rare, life-threatening event that requires swift diagnosis and intervention. Rudolf Virchow first described his famous triad of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) >100 years ago and it remains relevant today: venous stasis, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulable state.1 Further, there is up to a 5-fold increase in the incidence of PE in the perioperative period.1 We present a case of intraoperative pulmonary embolism in a patient with known risk factors while undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection for recurrent malignancy. Case Presentation: A 52-year-old male with a history of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) status post prior resection, chemotherapy, and radiation, GERD, HTN, and obesity presented for tumor resection. Per clinical trial, patient could not receive any medications that affected CYP3A4. Twenty minutes after induction, patient started to display hemodynamic instability and had hypoxemic episodes that responded, initially, to recruitment breath maneuvers. At that time, a baseline ABG was drawn that revealed a large PaCO<inf>2</inf> end-tidal CO<inf>2</inf> gradient, which raised suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolus. Shortly thereafter, hemodynamic instability ensued, and patient was up-titrated on vasopressors: phenylephrine, then norepinephrine and epinephrine. Surgery was aborted before entering the cranial vault, and interventional radiology (IR) was contacted. Patient was transported to IR for catheterization of pulmonary arteries and was found to have massive bilateral pulmonary embolisms and subsequently systemically heparinized. Infusion catheters were placed in bilateral arteries, and tPa boluses were started for clot lysis. After boluses, patient regained some hemodynamic stability, but remained on high-dose vasopressor infusions. Bilateral infusion catheters were left in place, patient was transported to neurosurgical ICU on norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin infusions, and nitric oxide was started. Overnight, patient was weaned off norepinephrine, and oxygenation and ventilation improved. He remained on nitric oxide and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Despite cardiopulmonary improvement, patient's family elected to withdraw care given his poor prognosis with or without tumor resection. Discussion(s): An increase in alveolar dead space is associated with pulmonary thromboembolism with high sensitivity and specificity in surgical patients,1 in addition to cardiopulmonary compromise. Studies have shown a statistically significant reduction in mortality in patients with major PE who received directed thrombolysis compared with systemic heparin alone.1 Regardless of intervention, mortality in hemodynamically unstable patients with PE remains as high as 30%.2.",Excluded
278,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded

1318,"SPECT/CT hybrid imaging; with which CT?. AIM: The aim of this study is to show the practical use of, and to discuss the rationale for, high-end computed tomography (CT) integrated with intrinsic low-resolution single-photon emission tomography (SPECT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: All examinations performed on three new SPECT/CT systems with diagnostic CT capabilities were recorded retrospectively. The use of CT was classified as low-dose, using the CT with restraint as to the tube current and radiation dose, or diagnostic, with an optimum use of the CT, using CT protocols as used in ordinary radiological practice. The number of low-dose CT was compared with the number of diagnostic CT examinations. The report is based on 436 patient examinations from three hospitals in Norway with recently installed SPECT/CT systems, the time of use varying from 6 months to 2 years. The examinations performed were myocardial perfusion (45%), various tumors (thyroid, parathyroid, neuroendocrine 37%), malignant skeletal disease (12%), brain perfusion (4%), sentinel nodes in breast cancer (1%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (1%).RESULTS: Of the 436 patients, 431 had a low-dose CT for attenuation correction, anatomic localisation and, also for diagnosis, whereas five patients had a diagnostic CT. In these series, as was found in recent literature, the diagnostic potential of the CT was seldom used to its capacity and always in predetermined diagnostic situations.CONCLUSION: There is a low degree of utilization of the diagnostic capabilities of the CT in the SPECT/CT context, for a number of reasons. This raises questions about the cost-benefit of investing in high-end CT for SPECT/CT applications.",Excluded
1887,"Extracellular spike microrecordings from the subthalamic area in Parkinson's disease. Intraoperative neuronal microrecordings can help in localizing the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during stereotactic neurosurgery for deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease. To obtain quantitative information on neuronal spike descriptors, we systematically analysed neuronal spikes in the STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in 31 sides of the brain in awake patients undergoing stereotactic neurosurgery for DBS electrode implantation. In these two structures we evaluated spike amplitude, area, duration, rise time and mean total firing rate. The recording spike density was higher in the STN than in the SNr (94% vs. 28%). Microelectrode recordings showed a larger spike area and amplitude in the SNr than in the STN ([mean+/-SD] amplitude: 46.7+/-31.1 vs. 36.3+/-29.6 microV; area: 25.6+/-24.2 vs. 36.7+/-21.4 microVmsec), a higher total firing rate at rest in the SNr than in the STN (78.6+/-53.5 vs. 61.9+/-40.8 Hz), and a longer duration and rise time in the SNr than in the STN (duration: 2.0+/-1 vs. 1.3+/-0.6 ms; rise time: 0.95+/-0.6 vs. 0.67+/-0.3 ms). Our analysis also revealed sex-related differences in the studied spike descriptors, paralleling recent findings from deep electroencephalography recordings. In the STN, males had larger spike area and amplitude (amplitude: 41.97+/-32.57 vs. 26.2+/-19.7 microV; area: 31.8+/-26.4 vs. 13.0+/-10.6 microVmsec), whereas females had higher mean total firing rate (66.7+/-53.4 vs. 82.8+/-50.8 Hz).

Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an inexorably progressive motoneuron disease, is accompanied by significantly increased markers of inflammation. These inflammatory constituents could protect, harm, do neither, or do both. Objective(s): Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed in patients with sporadic ALS to suppress neuroinflammation and improve clinical outcomes after CNS engraftment. Method(s): Six patients with definite ALS received total body irradiation followed by peripheral blood HSCT infusion from human leukocyte antigen identically matched sibling donors. Disease progression and survival were assessed monthly and compared with matched historic database patients. Autopsy samples from brain and spinal cord were examined immunohistochemically and by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Donor-derived DNA in brain and spinal cord tissue was evaluated for the extent of chimerism. Result(s): No clinical benefits were evident. Four patients were 100% engrafted; postmortem tissue examination in two of the 100% engrafted patients demonstrated 16% to 38% donor-derived DNA at sites with motoneuron pathology, which may correspond to the observed increased CD68 or CD1a-positive cells. Neither donor DNA nor increased cell numbers were found in several unaffected brain regions. A third minimally engrafted patient had neither donor DNA nor increased infiltrating cells in the CNS. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that peripheral cells derived from donor hematopoietic stem cells can enter the human CNS primarily at sites of motoneuron pathology and engraft as immunomodulatory cells. Although unmodified hematopoietic stem cells did not benefit these sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, such cells may provide a cellular vehicle for future CNS gene therapy. © 2008 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.",Excluded
1476,"TrpC3/C7 and Slo2.1 are molecular targets for metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling in rat striatal cholinergic interneurons. Large aspiny cholinergic interneurons provide the sole source of striatal acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for basal ganglia function; these tonically active interneurons receive excitatory inputs from corticostriatal glutamatergic afferents that act, in part, via metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We combined electrophysiological recordings in brain slices with molecular neuroanatomy to identify distinct ion channel targets for mGluR1/5 receptors in striatal cholinergic interneurons: transient receptor potential channel 3/7 (TrpC3/C7) and Slo2.1. In recordings obtained with methanesulfonate-based internal solutions, we found an mGluR-activated current with voltage-dependent and pharmacological properties reminiscent of TrpC3 and TrpC7; expression of these TrpC subunits in cholinergic interneurons was verified by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and modulation of both TrpC channels was reconstituted in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells cotransfected with mGluR1 or mGluR5. With a chloride-based internal solution, mGluR agonists did not activate interneuron TrpC-like currents. Instead, a time-dependent, outwardly rectifying K(+) current developed after whole-cell access, and this Cl(-)-activated K(+) current was strongly inhibited by volatile anesthetics and mGluR activation. This modulation was recapitulated in cells transfected with Slo2.1, a Na(+)- and Cl(-)-activated K(+) channel, and Slo2.1 expression was confirmed histochemically in striatal cholinergic interneurons. By using gramicidin perforated-patch recordings, we established that the predominant agonist-activated current was TrpC-like when ambient intracellular chloride was preserved, although a small K(+) current contribution was observed in some cells. Together, our data indicate that mGluR1/5-mediated glutamatergic excitation of cholinergic interneurons is primarily a result of activation of TrpC3/TrpC7-like cationic channels; under conditions when intracellular NaCl is elevated, a Slo2.1 background K(+) channel may also contribute.",Excluded
1829,"CBCT-guided Winston Lutz test. Purpose/Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of the radiation isocenter of a linac when a Winston Lutz (WL) test is performed using the CBCT as a localization tool for the target. Material(s) and Method(s): A Varian 2100 CD linac equipped witha 120 MLC, aSi 500 EPID and OBI system (v 1.5). A phantom containing a central tungsten ball (5 mm diameter) mimicking a target is used. The phantom was CT scanned in a Siemens Somaton scanner (planning CT, pCT) and imported into the Eclipse TPS (v. 10.0). The tungsten ball was delineated and a no-coplanar plan (WL plan) was added with its isocenter located at the ball center. The WL plan consisted of 10 smallfields (6X) of 2x2 cm size collimated with the Millennium 120 MLC of the linac (G0T0,G140T315, G140T270, G180T0, G220T90, G220T45, G270T0, G270T45, G90T0 and G90T315,where G: gantry and T: table, scale: Varian IEC). The WL plan includes a CBCT field setup. The phantom was setup in the linac by aligning the ball center with the room lasers. After that, intended shifts within +/- 1 cm were applied alongside the three translational directions of the table, in order to simulate a setup error of the phantom. CBCT was acquired (Gantryrotation: 360degree, FOV: 45 cm, matrix: 512x512 and slice distance: 1 mm) and 3D/3D match was performed using the pCTas reference. The required couch movements to correct the actual position ofthe target were applied in a remote way. After that, the WL plan was delivered and an integrated MV image for each field was acquired using the EPID. EPID was positioned at 80 cm below the linac isocenter, giving a pixel size of 0.4 mm. The WL plan was irradiated twelve times during a year (118 shots/images). Each recorded MV image was analysed with ImageJ software in order to measure the distance (2D) between the ball center and the field center. Each 2D distance was decomposed into the three anatomical directions (Left/Right, Anterior/Posterior and Superior/Inferior). Result(s): The analysis of the 118 MV images collected reported the following differences (mean and 95% CI) between the ball center and the radiation center: 1) L/R : 0.6 mm [95% CI: 1.4 mm] 2) AP/PA : 0.5 mm [95% CI: 1.2 mm] 3) Sup/Inf: 0.7 mm [95% CI: 1.6 mm] Conclusion(s): The isocenter accuracy was within 2 mm on each direction, when the CBCT technique is used for target localization. The results found in this study included inaccuracies due to gantry and couch rotations, remote couch movements and potential misalignments between the linac and the OBI isocenters.

PURPOSE: To compare in the electroencephalogram of rats the effects of scopolamine (an acetylcholine receptor antagonist) alone and after repeated exposure to low-level microwaves modulated at extremely low frequency.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Averaged frequency spectra (0.5-30 Hz) of the electroencephalogram were studied in freely moving rats with carbon electrodes implanted into the somatosensory cortex. The rats were repeatedly (3 days, 30 min day(-1)) exposed to low-intensity (approximately = 0.3 mW cm(-2)) microwaves (915 MHz, 20-ms pulse duration), amplitude modulated (square-wave) at extremely low frequency (4 Hz).RESULTS: The exposure to extremely low frequency microwaves alone significantly enhanced the fast electroencephalographic rhythms (18-30 Hz). This effect was observed neither in subsequent sham-exposure experiment nor in radiation-naive animals. In the microwave-exposed rats, scopolamine (0.1 mg kg(-1), subcutaneously) did not cause a slowing in the electroencephalogram that was shown in non-exposed rats. A similarity between the scopolamine-induced electroencephalogram effect in the microwave-exposed rats and that of physostigmine (enhancing the acetylcholine level in the brain) in radiation-naive animals was noted. This paradoxical phenomenon stimulates new experimentation for understanding its mechanism(s).CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained provide additional evidence that repeated low-level exposure to extremely low frequency microwaves can modify an activity of cholinergic system in the brain.",Excluded

When the recipients exposed to lethal irradiation were administered the RAMBS-treated bone marrow cells and one of the peptides, it was shown that in concomitant administration, thymohexin and thymocytes lost their ability to restore colony formation by RAMBS-treated bone marrow. Thymogen did not suppress the stimulating activity of thymocytes. It is suggested that the differences observed between the tested peptides in their ability to recover colony formation were determined by their structure.",Excluded
1922,"The neurophysiology of vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be induced by a wide variety of stimuli such as pregnancy, space travel, raised intracranial pressure, radiation and cytotoxic drugs. The mechanisms by which all these diverse stimuli culminate in a final common act is unknown. From studies in the 1950s a model of the emetic reflex emerged consisting of a chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema and a vomiting centre in the brain stem. This concept has been reviewed and revised in the light of recent studies. Many discussions of emesis involve detailed descriptions of the gastrointestinal events associated with the act of vomiting only - nausea and retching receiving little attention. Here we have tried to give a broader view by considering the neurophysiology of such events and have included nausea and retching, phenomena that are usually inseparable from vomiting. The possible biological function of these events is also discussed. The involvement of visceral systems (such as the heart, airways and gut) is included, and particular attention is paid to vagal mechanisms underlying the changes in gut motor activity. Emesis has long been thought to be organized by a 'vomiting centre'; the possibility that this vomiting centre could be the parvcellular reticular formation is reviewed, as is the concept that the 'centre' is larger than an anatomically defined single group of cells. The mechanism of action of two clinically relevant emetic stimuli - radiation and cytotoxic drugs - is considered in detail. Recent studies of the antiemetic properties of novel 5-HT-3 receptor antagonists against radiation and cytotoxic drug-induced vomiting are discussed; these studies suggest that important advances will be made in the treatment of emesis induced by these and other related agents.",Excluded
220,"Learning Vector Quantization with Training Count (LVQTC). Kohonen's learning vector quantization (LVQ) is modified by attributing training counters to each neuron, which record its training statistics. During training, this allows for dynamic self-allocation of the neurons to classes. In the classification stage training counters provide an estimate of the reliability of classification of the single neurons, which can be exploited to obtain a substantially higher purity of classification. The method turns out to be especially valuable in the presence of considerable overlaps among class distributions in the pattern space. The results of a typical application to high energy elementary particle physics are discussed in detail. Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",Excluded
1122,"Criteria for assessing the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas, complications of therapy and there prevention. [Russian]. The authors assess the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas in 954 patients. Strontium ophthalmoapplicators were used in 652, rutenium ones in 302 patients. As a rule, Sr applicators were sutured in patients with tumors up to 3.5 mm thick and Ru ones in cases with tumors thicker than 3.5 mm. A special program was used for individual approach and improving the accuracy of planning. A total of 74.5% of patients have been followed up for at least 3 years, with check-ups every 3-6 months. The effect of brachytherapy was considered positive in cases with complete resorption or at least 50% decrease of the tumor and a stable clinical picture for 9-12 months. In 60% of patients the tumor regressed completely, in 16% partially, and in 24% there were signs of activation of melanoma growth one year after treatment. The frequency of radiation complications was as follows: retinopaty, 3.15%; neuroretinopathy, 1.1%; hemophthalmia, 0.9%; neovascular glaucoma, 1.1%; cataract, 0.63%. The incidence of radiation complications increases with increase of the applicator power and rigidity of exposure. Computer planning of brachytherapy with due consideration for the size of the tumor and the eye and localization of the neoplasm for each case will help decrease the incidence of complications.",Excluded
2122,"Pre-operative meningioma embolization with ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Introduction The benefit of pre-operative embolization of meningioma and hemangiopericytoma continues to be debated. Several large cohort studies of 80-198 patients have reported complication rates of 2.5% to 9% using particles or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA).[1-5] However, although a recent national registry of 898 patients found an association between liquid embolysate and complication rates, with an odds ratio of 3.9.[6] Endovascular technology continues to evolve and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH or Onyx Medtronic) has been available for embolization of arteriovenous malformations for over a decade. The off-label use of EVOH for pre-operative embolization of meningiomas or hemangiopericytomas has only been reported in small series. This study reviewed the safety profile and embolization duration of our experience with EVOH embolization. Methods Review of institutional records identified 72 consecutive cases of meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas that underwent pre-operative embolization with EVOH prior to surgical resection from 2007 to 2017. The imaging and medical records were reviewed to identify tumor dimensions, vascular pedicles, endovascular equipment, outcomes and complications. Embolization rate was compared with Wilcox signed-rank test and complication rates were compared using the Fisher exact test. Results The tumors measured 5 cm (IQR 4.4-6.3) or 45 cm<sup>3</sup> (23-71) and were located on the convexity (26%), tentorium (22%), falx (20%), sphenoid ridge (15%), petrous (5%), anterior cranial fossa (5%), infratemporal fossa (4%), and middle cranial fossa (3%). The most frequent pedicle embolized was a middle meningeal artery. In 83% of cases, this was the first pedicle embolized and in 24% of cases, an additional MMA catheterization was used for embolization. Additional pedicles included the internal maxillary (8), occipital artery (7), superficial temporal (4), posterior meningeal (2), posterior auricular (1), and ascending pharyngeal (1) arteries. Tumor supply from branches of the internal carotid artery were typically not embolized: anterior cerebral branches (3 embolized: 7 not embolized), middle cerebral branches (0:11), ophthalmic branches (0:11). In 7 cases, nBCA was also used, most commonly in the superior cerebellar artery (3:7). Abstract O-033 Table 1 Tumor embolization characteristics VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP There were symptomatic complications from embolization in 8% of cases. Twice, tumor necrosis and edema required earlier craniotomy and tumor evacuation, and four patients had new neurologic deficit from infarct. Two occurred from reflux and two occurred from embolysate migration across the tumor to pial vessels. The complication rate was not different from studies in meningiomas with 75 or more cases using other embolysates (p-value 0.15-1.0). In power analysis, comparison against previously published studies would distinguish a complication rate of 23% in a series of this size. Conclusion Embolization with EVOH is comparable in safety to other embolization techniques in meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Similar to what has been described in arteriovenous malformations, simultaneous dual catheter embolization may decrease procedural time and radiation exposure.",Excluded
966,"Prevention and treatment of the consequences of head and neck radiotherapy. The location of the primary tumor or lymph node metastases dictates the inclusion of the oral cavity, salivary glands, and jaws in the radiation treatment portals for patients who have head and neck cancer. The clinical sequelae of the radiation treatment include mucositis, hyposalivation, loss of taste, osteoradionecrosis, radiation caries, and trismus. These sequelae may be dose-limiting and have a tremendous effect on the patient's quality of life. Most treatment protocols to prevent these sequelae are still based on clinical experience, but alternatives based on fundamental basic and clinical research are becoming more and more available. Many of these alternatives either need further study before they can be incorporated into the protocols commonly used to prevent and treat the radiation-related oral sequelae or await implementation of these protocols. In this review, the various possibilities for prevention and/or treatment of radiation-induced changes in healthy oral tissues and their consequences are discussed. [References: 188]",Excluded
2968,"Spinal epidural tumor in patients with prostate cancer: Clinical and radiographic predictors of response to radiation therapy. The authors retrospectively reviewed 50 episodes of spinal epidural tumor that occurred in 42 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and were treated with external-beam radiation. Treatment response was evaluated in terms of symptoms, neurologic status, and, in most cases, reduction of tumor on repeat myelography. At the completion of therapy, 92% of treated patients experienced pain relief and 67% had significant to complete improvement on neurologic examination. Thirty days after treatment, repeat myelography was performed in 40 of the 50 cases; compared with the initial findings immediately preceding radiation therapy (RT), the results of 58% of these studies had normalized completely, results were improved in 25%, and the results had not changed in 18%. The presence of a high-grade compression fracture of the vertebral body was an indicator of poor prognosis for tumor response on repeat myelography. The ability of a patient to walk before treatment and tumor response on repeat myelography were associated significantly with improved outcome of RT and with survival. The authors conclude that RT can effectively palliate epidural lesions from metastatic prostate cancer. The prognosis for the long-term response to therapy may be indicated by pretreatment ambulatory status and posttreatment imaging of the epidural space.",Excluded
1670,"Evaluation of QOL and psychological response in patients treated with palliative radiotherapy. Purpose or Objective Usually, evaluation of palliative radiotherapy is made by physical findings or levels of pain relief. But little is known about patient quality of life (QOL), psychophysiological response, and assessment of adverse effect from the view point of QOL. We evaluated the effects of palliative radiotherapy for cancer recurrence or metastasis on patient QOL and psychophysiology. Material and Methods A total of 67 patients who received palliative radiotherapy between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled. Patient diseases were bone metastasis in 51 patients, lymph node metastasis in 7 patients, brain metastasis in 2 patients, local recurrence in 3 patients, and the others in 4 patients. Median irradiated dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions for palliative radiotherapy. We used the questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL to evaluate patient QOL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate patient mental healthcare at the start and at the end of radiotherapy. Results As compared to scores at the start of radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, numerical rating scale (NRS) and face scale significantly decreased. On the other hand, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) did not show no changes during palliative radiotherapy. In functional scales, average scores of role functioning (RF2) and emotional functioning (EF) also improved. In symptom scales, average scores of fatigue (FA), pain (PA), and insomnia (SL) improved. In bone metastasis group, global health status / QOL (QL2), PA, and SL significantly improved. After palliative radiotherapy, anxiety score of HADS was elevated below age of 70 years. There was relationship between anxiety improvement and QOL improvement after palliative radiotherapy. Nausea and vomiting scores of EORTC-QLQC15- PAL were associated with the irradiated volume of palliative radiotherapy for pelvic region. Conclusion Patient QOL of was improved by palliative radiotherapy regardless of PS. The possibility of palliative radiotherapy having a positive influence on patient psychophysiology was also suggested in younger age.",Excluded

It may improve the diagnostic confidence of dating, nuchal translucency (NT) and chorionicity assignment in twin pregnancies. The ""virtual 3DUS placentoscopy"" can guide selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP) to treat twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Volumetric assessment of the dysmorphic acardiac twin with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis (VOCAL) software is more accurate than the conventional ultrasound measurement. Twin anemia polycythemia (TAP) sequence and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) may be clinically monitored with 3DUS placental volume (PV) and power Doppler vascular indices. Congenital anomalies are more common in twins. Evaluation of fetal anomalies with 3DUS could assist perinatal management. The 3DUS power Doppler can provide a better understanding of true and false umbilical cord knots, which are commonly found in monoamniotic (MA) twins. Single demise in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies can cause severe neurologic morbidity in the surviving co-twin. Prenatal prediction of brain injury in the surviving co-twin with unremarkable neurosonographic examination is difficult. The 3DUS power Doppler may aid in prenatal detection of subtle abnormal cerebral perfusion. Prenatal assessment of conjoined twins with 3DUS is important if emergency postnatal surgical separation is anticipated. There is no significant additional advantage in using real-time 3DUS to guide prenatal interventions. Assessment of the cervix and pelvic floor during twin pregnancies is enhanced with 3DUS. Due to lack of high-quality studies, routine prenatal 3DUS in twin pregnancies needs to be balanced with risks of excessive ultrasound exposure.

231,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [18F]FEDAA1106: a human whole-body PET study. PURPOSE: [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is a recently developed positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for in vivo quantification of the 18 kDa translocator protein [TSPO or, as earlier called, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)]. TSPO imaging is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for [(18)F]FEDAA1106 based on human whole-body PET measurements.METHODS: PET scans were performed for a total of 6.6 h after the injection of 183.8 +/- 9.1 MBq of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 in six healthy subjects. Regions of interest were drawn on coronal images. Estimates of the absorbed doses of radiation were calculated using the OLINDA software.RESULTS: Peak uptake was largest in lungs, followed by liver, small intestine, kidney, spleen and other organs. Peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lungs (27.1%ID at 0.2 h), liver (21.1%ID at 0.6 h), small intestine (10.4%ID at 6.3 h), kidney (4.9%ID at 1.8 h) and spleen (4.6%ID at 0.6 h). The largest absorbed dose was found in the spleen (0.12 mSv/MBq), followed by kidneys (0.094 mSv/MBq). The calculated mean effective dose was 0.036 mSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the estimated radiation burden of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is moderately higher than that of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In clinical studies, the administered activity of this radioligand ought to be adjusted in line with regional regulations.

Introduction: Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies; however, no serum marker has been routinely recommended until now. Method(s): This is a prospective case control study including two groups of patients: Group Ipatients with advanced lung cancer and Group IIpatients with benign lung disease as control. Serum cytokeratin 19 (CK19) fragment levels were measured at baseline by real-time polymerase chain reaction before first-line chemotherapy. The CK19 cut-off taken was 15-cycle threshold. The primary end point was the comparison of high CK19 in cases and controls. The secondary end point was the correlation between high CK19 and progressive disease (PD), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in advanced lung cancer patients. Result(s): A total of 30 patients with advanced lung cancer (16 non-small and 14 small cell lung cancer) and 15 patients with benign lung disease were included and followed up during the period from October 2008 to October 2011 with median follow-up of one and half years. High CK19 was found in 90% of lung cancer cases as compared with 7% in controls (p < 0.001). High CK19 was found in all cases showing PD (p = 0.04).

1335,"Potential role of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors of the maxillary sinus. Purpose: To assess 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques to see whether doses to critical structures could be reduced while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage in patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus because of the risk of radiation-induced complications, particularly visual loss. Methods and Materials: Six patients who had recently received conventional RT for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus were studied. Conventional RT, 3D-CRT, and step-and-shoot IMRT plans were prepared using the same 2-field arrangement. The effect of reducing the number of segments in the IMRT beams was investigated. Result(s): 3D-CRT and IMRT reduced the brain and ipsilateral parotid gland doses compared with the conventional plans. IMRT reduced doses to both optic nerves; for the contralateral optic nerve, 15-segment IMRT plans delivered an average maximal dose of 56.4 Gy (range 53.9-59.3) compared with 65.7 Gy (range 65.3-65.9) and 64.2 Gy (range 61.4-65.6) for conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. IMRT also gave improved PTV homogeneity and improved coverage, with an average of 8.5% (range 7.0-11.7%) of the volume receiving <95% of the prescription dose (64 Gy) compared with 14.7% (range 14.1-15.9%) and 15.1% (range 14.4-16.1%) with conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Little difference was found between the 15 and 7-segment plans, but 5 segments resulted in a reduced minimal PTV dose. Conclusion(s): IMRT offers significant advantages over conventional RT and 3D-CRT techniques for treatment of maxillary sinus tumors. Good results can be obtained from 7 segments per beam without compromising the PTV coverage. This number of segments is practical for implementation in a busy RT department. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Background: Cyberknife stereotactic treatment is a precisely targeted radiation to a tumor while minimizing injury to adjacent normal tissue, with well-established indication in intracranial tumors. The role of cyberknife treatment in advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients is still in evolution and needs more focus. Aim(s): To evaluate survival and other outcomes of cyberknife treatment in a cohort of advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients. Method(s): This is a retrospective data review of all advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with poor prognosis who are not amenable for any kind of treatment from August 2010 to December 2012. Patients' demographics, date of diagnosis, location and size of the cancer, duration and dose of cyberknife treatment and date of death of all pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients were collected. Kaplan Meier survival curves were used to calculate the mean and median survival times for the overall cohort. The log rank test was used to compare survival by lesion size ( >=3 cm versus < 3cm). Result(s): Our cohort consisted of 17 patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent cyberknife treatment. Age at diagnosis ranged from 49 - 90 years with a mean of 75.2 +/- 12.9 years and eight patients (50%) were males. Tumor size ranged from 0.6 - 6.0 cm with an average size of 2.6 +/- 1.4 cm. Cyberknife treatment dose ranged from 2500 - 5400 cGy (centi Gray units) with a mean dose of 3671.8 +/- 918.0 cGy. The mean survival time for the entire cohort was 29.7 +/- 5.9 months and median survival time was 25.1 +/- 8.4 months (Figure 1), when compared to published literature of 6 - 8 months survival in advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients.

The effects of chronic, low-dose amitriptyline on serotonin (5-HT) synthesis rate were measured in rat brain using autoradiography and the trapping of alpha-[14C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[14C]-MTrp). Rats received amitriptyline (2 mg/kg per day) or saline via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps for 21 days. Amitriptyline had no effect on any physiological parameters measured, or on free or total plasma tryptophan levels. However, amitriptyline exerted selective decreases of 15% and 17% (P < 0.001) in serotonin synthesis rates in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, respectively. There was no reduction in any of the projection areas studied, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus or striatum. The data suggest that chronic low doses of amitriptyline can lead to sustained 5-HT re-uptake inhibition selectively in the raphe nuclei, an effect compatible with tonic activation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT synthesis. The failure of chronic amitriptyline treatment to affect 5-HT synthesis rate in the projection areas may ensure an adequate regulation of pain pathways implicated in migraine headache, an effect possibly related to amitriptyline anti-migraine efficacy.",Excluded
472,"Cranial nerve preservation and outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for jugular foramen schwannomas. OBJECTIVE: Jugular foramen region schwannomas are rare intracranial tumors that usually present with multiple lower cranial nerve deficits. For some patients, complete surgical resection is possible but may be associated with significant morbidity. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive alternative or adjunct to microsurgery for such tumors. We reviewed our clinical and imaging outcomes after patients underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for management of jugular foramen schwannomas.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with 35 tumors (one patient had bilateral tumors) underwent radiosurgery between May 1990 and December 2005. Twenty-two patients had previous microsurgical resection and all patients experienced various cranial neuropathies. A median of six isocenters were used. Median marginal and maximum doses were 14 and 28 Gy, respectively.RESULTS: None of the patients were lost to evaluation and the mean duration of follow-up was 83 months. Tumors regressed in 17 patients, remained stable in 16, and progressed in two. Five- and 10-year actuarial control rates were 97 and 94%, respectively. Preexisting cranial neuropathies improved in 20% and remained stable in 77% after radiosurgery. One patient worsened. The function of all previous intact nerves was preserved after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery proved to be a safe and effective management for newly diagnosed or residual jugular foramen schwannomas.

This study sought to investigate modification of the radiation response in a rat 9L brain tumor model in vivo by the wild-type p53 gene (wtp53). Determination of the timing and dose of radiation therapy required the assessment of the duration of the effect of wtp53 expression on 9L tumors after in vivo transfection. Methods. Anesthetized male F-344 rats each were stereotactically inoculated with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> 9L gliosarcoma cells through a skull screw into the cerebrum in the right frontal region. Twelve-day-old tumors were inoculated through the screw with recombinant adenoviral vectors under isoflurane anaesthesia: control rats with Ad5/RSV/GL2 (carrying the luciferase gene), and study rats with Ad5CMV-p53 (carrying the wtp53 gene). Brain tumors removed at specific times after transfection were measured, homogenized, and lysed and wtp53 expression determined by Western blot analysis. Four groups of nine rats were, subsequently, implanted with iodine-125 seeds 15 days post-tumor inoculation to give a minimum tumor dose of 40 or 60 Gy. Results. We demonstrated transfer of wtp53 into rat 9L tumors in vivo using the Ad5CMV-p53 vector. The expression of wtp53 was demonstrated to be maximum between days 1 and 3 post-vector inoculation. Tumors expressing wtp53 were smaller than controls transfected with Ad5/RSV/GL2 but this difference was not statistically significant. Radiation made a significant difference to the survival of tumor-bearing rats. Moreover, wtp53 expression conferred a significant additional survival advantage. Conclusion. The expression of wtp53 significantly improves the survival of irradiated tumor-bearing rats in our model.",Excluded

Sympathomimetic agents are frequent components in antimotion-sickness drug combinations because of their usefulness in counteracting the sedation caused by stressful motion or resulting from the administration of other antimotion-sickness drugs. The noradrenergic neurochemistry of the brain's arousal-attentional systems prompted us to evaluate the efficacy of five new sympathomimetic drugs and to further define the role of arousal in susceptibility to motion. Subjects were orally administered methamphetamine (20 mg), phenmetrazine (25 mg), phentermine (37.5 mg), methylphenidate (20 mg), or pemoline (75 mg) 2 h prior to taking a Staircase Profile Test. All of the drugs increased resistance to stressful coriolis stimulation by 80-120%. Methylphenidate and pemoline showed fewer side effects. These findings, interpreted in conjunction with the documented inefficacy of most anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs tested to date, suggest that sympathomimetic drugs or a generalized state of arousal can inhibit the development of motion sickness.",Excluded

Therefore, different concepts are under discussion without a uniform standard of therapy and diagnostics. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated all spinal ependymomas treated surgically from 03/2006 until 05/2012 at our department. This consecutive, retrospective series includes 41 patients: 23 female, 18 male, median age 51 y. (range 21-80). 22 Ependymomas were located intramedullary, 18 within cauda equina or filum terminale, 1 patient presented with multifocal spinal lesions including both, intramedullar and extramedullar lesions. Perioperative standard diagnostic of most tumors included a holospinal MRI and a CSF cytology. First follow-up MRI and exam was done 3 months postoperatively, further controls every year in case of stable findings. Current median follow-up is 29 months (range 3-72). Preoperative, early postoperative and follow-up clinical performance was evaluated according to the modified McCormick scale. Postoperative deterioration was dichotomized in ""slight"" (=deterioration without any increase of the modified McCormick scale grades or an increase in only one grade within the scale range 1-2) and ""significant"" (=increase to grade 7ge;3 on the modified McCormick scale). Result(s): Preoperatively, the vast majority presented neurologically intact or with mild deficits maintaining functional independence according to the modified McCormick scale. The most common preoperative symptom was pain (78%), followed by sensory deficits (54%), gait ataxia (34%), motor deficits (27%), and bowel/bladder dysfunction (12%). In only one patient the ependymoma was found incidentally. Gross total resection (GTR) could be achieved in 85% (n=35) (subtotal resection n=5, debulking of the main tumor mass of a multifocal disease n=1). Histology: the majority were WHO IIdegree (n=30), 10 WHOdegreeI tumours, 1 case of anaplastic ependymoma WHOdegreeIII. Immediately after surgery 24% (n=10) showed worsening of neurological symptoms, but in most cases only mild new deficits occurred. During follow up 78% (n=32) showed at least preop status, 37% (n=15) improved. In only 5% (n=2) a permanent significant deterioration remained. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed after the first surgery in two cases: in one patient with drop metastasis after the GTR of the main tumour, and in another patient with multifocal lesions after debulking, both were WHOdegreeII ependymomas. Tumour recurrence was seen in 4 cases, so far: 3 WHOdegreeII, 1 WHOdegreeI, 2 of them despite previous GTR and 1 despite adjuvant radiation. Median progression free survival was 22 months (range 6-43). 2 patients died of meningeosis 19 and 31 months after the initial diagnosis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Gross-total resection still stays the main column of ependymoma therapy. In our series this could be achieved in 85% accompanied by a rate of 5% for significant persistent deficits. In cases of incomplete resection stereotactic radiotherapy as well as a wait and see srategy can be considered. In case of disseminated disease holospinal radiation with a boost to the primary tumour site is recommended. Due to the risk of recurrence, close follow up with clinical and imaging examinations are mandatory.",Excluded
3213,"Unusual acute and delayed skin reactions during and after whole-brain radiotherapy in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Two case reports. BACKGROUND: Besides radiotherapy (RT) and surgery, the introduction of BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib has provided new opportunities for treatment of patients with metastasized malignant melanomas. RT and vemurafenib are being increasingly used concurrently, although little is known about the potential side effects of this combination. Vemurafenib is known to cause severe cutaneous skin reactions such as phototoxicity and evidence is accumulating that RT may further enhance these side effects.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report two cases of unusual skin reactions occurring during and after treatment with a combination of vemurafenib and whole-brain irradiation in patients with cerebral metastases arising from malignant melanomas.RESULTS: One case report describes excessive acute radiodermatitis which arose during whole-brain irradiation in combination with vemurafenib. The second describes a late skin reaction occurring approximately 30 days after completion of RT.CONCLUSION: These two case reports show that combination of both treatment modalities is possible, but requires close monitoring of patients and good interdisciplinary collaboration.",Excluded

1657,"Incidence and management of late adverse radiation effects after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery. Background: Late adverse radiation effects (ARE) typically occur many years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). They are characterized by perilesional edema or cyst formation and are distinct from radiationinduced changes (RIC) noted in the first 1 to 2 years after AVM SRS and radiation necrosis. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of late ARE after AVM SRS. Method(s): Retrospective review of 233 AVM patients having SRS from 1990 to 2009. Patients had sporadic AVM, no prior radiation, and a minimum of 5 years of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The median MRI follow-up after SRS was 9.8 years (range, 5-24.2). Result(s): Late ARE were observed in 16 patients (6.9%) at a median of 8.7 years after SRS (range, 2.0-16.1). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of late ARE was 0.4%, 7.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Eight patients (3.4%) were symptomatic at the time of ARE detection. Three of 8 patients who were initially asymptomatic had documented cyst progression (at 11, 40, and 42 months), for an overall symptomatic rate of 4.7%. Five patients with asymptomatic ARE have been observed for a median of 9.3 years (range, 2.0-14.1) without progression. Patients having early RIC (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, P < .001), patients having obliteration (HR=1.24, P=.02), and patients having SRS before April 1997 (HR=1.12, P=.02) weremore likely to develop late ARE. Conclusion(s): Late ARE are common in AVM patients who develop early RIC after SRS. Resection of the thrombosed AVM and the adjacent damaged tissue is effective at eliminating the mass effect and improving patients' neurological condition.

310,"Relationship between volume, dose and local control in stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastasis. The aim of this study is to analyse the efficacy of linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on prognostic factors, local control rate and survival in patients with brain metastasis. Patients with either a single metastasis or up to 4 multiple brain metastases with a maximum tumour diameter of 40 mm for each tumour and a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) > or = 70 were eligible for SRS. SRS was applied to 150 lesions in 86 consecutive patients with a median age of 60 years (median 1 and mean 1.7 lesions per patient, mean KPS 86). Median overall survival was 6.2 months after SRS and 9.7 months from diagnosis of brain metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed that a KPS of 90 or more (p = 0.009) and female sex (p = 0.003) were associated with a longer survival. Radiation dose < or = 15 Gy (p = 0.017) and KPS < 90 (p = 0.013) were independent predictors of a shorter time to local failure. Five patients showed evidence of radionecrosis with a median survival of 14.8 months. Addition of WBRT neither led to improvement of survival nor to improvement of local control. Improved local control following SRS for brain metastases was associated with KPS > or =90, a radiation dose > 15 Gy and a PTV < 13 cc.

1165,"Achieving sub cm CTV-PTV margin in pelvic treatments: Radiographers learning curve. Aims: Image guidance is not always feasible or available for standard/ conformal treatments and so, offline portal image measurements help define population based CTV-PTV margins. Reproducibility in pelvis is aided by the use of ankle- and/or knee-indexed supports available in standard sizes generally suiting the needs of taller western patients. Radiographers need to be convinced of the importance for use of one/more positional devices as this adds to setup effort and time. Different permutations of aligning the pelvis and positional aids, resident supervised or not are reported for patients treated for cancer of the cervix/endometrium. Method(s): Patients were aligned using lasers/field lights to either anterior field center (conventional alignment) or to mid line tattoo over mons pubis keeping constant 10 cm table top to vertical height for all setups using either standard ankle or knee plus ankle positioning device. Localization CT scanbased digitally reconstructed radiographs were used as reference to compare with portal imaging acquired generally in pattern of 3 in 1st week and weekly thereafter. The van Herk formula was used to compute CTV-PTV margin from anterior and lateral image projections to give mediolateral (ML), cranio-caudal (CC) and antero-posterior (AP) margins. Result(s): The initial pelvic alignment were done in the presence of a resident doctor using ankle positioning by two different alignment methods: conventional and setup (4 cm cranial offset from reference tattoo at mons pubis). The corresponding PTV margin in ML direction was 1.6 cm versus 0.9 cm, CC 1.2 cm versus 1.1 cm respectively and in AP was identical at 0.7 cm. Subsequently, with radiographers by themselves, PTV margins were 1.1 cm versus 0.9 cm for ML, 1.1 cm versus 1.5 cm, CC and 1.0 cm versus 0.9 cm in AP direction for conventional and setup alignment respectively. An increase in CC margin was seen for setup arm. The radiographers were given feedback and setup reproducibility was assessed for next 13 patients treated with a similar setup protocol. The PTV margins for this group in CC showed improvement to 1.1 cm, ML was 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm in AP directions. A knee-positioning device was introduced with ankle for patient alignment with setup protocol. An increase in PTV margin to 1.4 cm was calculated for ML with modest decrease in CC at 0.8 cm and 0.9 cm for AP direction with use of two devices. The standard knee device was abandoned as use of two devices was perceived as cumbersome and unsuitable in height for patients. A third technique of alignment keeping treatment center at tattooed reference plane (mons pubis) using ankle device was studied. The PTV margins for ML, CC, AP directions were within a cm-0.8 cm, 0.9 cm, 0.9 cm respectively which is now the current practice. Conclusion(s): There is a radiographer learning curve.

1242,"Fluid shift induced alterations of the optic nerve head and peripapillary choroid assessed using optical coherence tomography. Purpose: More than 50% of International Space Station astronauts demonstrate visual acuity decrements or ocular structural changes during or after spaceflight. The leading hypothesis explaining spaceflight-induced vision impairment is that a cephalad fluid shift leads to altered tissue volume and pressure relationships in the eye and orbit. We hypothesize that reducing venous outflow from the dependent limbs with a venoconstrictive thigh cuff will temporarily reverse or attenuate ocular and cerebral volume changes observed during 15degree head-down tilt (HDT). Method(s): Twenty normal subjects (12M, 8F) were studied following a 10 min stabilization period, seated, supine, HDT, and HDT with commercially-available thigh cuffs (CUFF) inflated to 60 mm Hg. We quantified Bruch's membrane to lamina cribrosa (LC) depth in 13 subjects and peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPC) in 19 subjects from enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography images. Average PPC was quantified from 1.5 to 3 mm from the center of the ONH along radial B-scans at clock hours 12, 3, 6, and 9. The optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and internal jugular vein cross-sectional area (IJVA) were measured using ultrasound. Mixed-effects linear regression model with repeated measures was used to test for significant PPC, LC, IJVA, and ONSD changes. All data are presented as mean +/- standard error. Result(s): Compared to seated (377+/-28 mum) or with CUFF (363+/-28 mum), LC depth significantly (P<0.01) increased in the supine (395+/-28 mum) and HDT (384+/-28 mum) positions. PPC at clock hour 9 significantly (P<0.01) increased from seated (198+/-16 mum) to HDT (208+/-16 mum), however CUFF was not significantly different from HDT. In addition, PPC at clock hours 12 and 6 were significantly different between the seated and HDT conditions. IJVA and ONSD increased from the seated (IJVA: 0.15+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.533+/-0.012 cm) to HDT (IJVA: 1.03+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.581 +/-0.012 cm) posture (P<0.001) but were not affected by CUFF. Conclusion(s): Moving from the seated to HDT posture alters LC depth and PPC. These results suggest that HDT, a microgravity analog results in an acute cephalad fluid shift that significantly alters posterior optic nerve head structure. Application of bilateral thigh cuffs inflated to 60 mm Hg for 10 minutes was not sufficient to reverse all these changes to levels measured during the seated posture.",Excluded

Tractography providesan importantanatomic guidance in the preoperative planning process, which aims at maximizing resection whilst minimising morbidity. This study aimed atdetermining the agreement between two different software packages for delineating corticospinal tract (CST), arcuate fasciculus (AF) and optic radiation (OR). METHOD(S): Forty-six histopathologically proven gliomapatients subdivided into:groupA with tracts passing at the tumour margin; and groupB with tracts passing through tumour and/ or in the peritumoural oedema. FSL and MRTrix software were used for tracking, in each patient,CST (hand, foot and lips component), AF and OR using the same regions of interest. Qualitative evaluation of the agreement between the two methods was performed by two experienced observers in consensus.

Background: Four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin and accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy (AHTRT) is the standard of care for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Irinotecan plus cisplatin significantly improved overall survival compared with etoposide plus cisplatin for extensive-stage SCLC. We compared these regimens for overall survival of patients with limited-stage SCLC. Method(s): We did this phase 3 study in 36 institutions in Japan. Eligibility criteria included age 20-70 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ functions. Eligible patients with previously untreated limited-stage SCLC received one cycle of etoposide plus cisplatin (intravenous etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-3; intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) plus AHTRT (1.5 Gy twice daily, 5 days a week, total 45 Gy over 3 weeks). Patients without progressive disease following induction therapy were randomised (1:1 ratio, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on ECOG performance status [0 vs 1], response to induction chemoradiotherapy [complete response plus near complete response vs partial response and stable disease], and institution) to receive either three further cycles of consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin or irinotecan plus cisplatin (intravenous irinotecan 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15; intravenous cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1). Patients, physicians, and investigators were aware of allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival after randomisation; primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144989, and the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000095. Finding(s): 281 patients were enrolled between Sept 1, 2002, and Oct 2, 2006. After induction etoposide plus cisplatin and AHTRT, 258 patients were randomised to consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin (n=129) or irinotecan plus cisplatin (n=129). In the etoposide plus cisplatin group, median overall survival was 3.2 years (95% CI 2.4-4.1). In the irinotecan and cisplatin group, median overall survival was 2.8 years (95% CI 2.4-3.6); overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 0.80-1.46], one-sided stratified log-rank p=0.70). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (120 [95%] in the etoposide plus cisplatin group vs 101 [78%] in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group), anaemia (44 [35%] vs 50 [39%]), thrombocytopenia (26 [21%] vs six [5%]), febrile neutropenia (21 [17%] vs 18 [14%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%] vs 13 [10%]). There was one treatment-related adverse event leading to death in each group (radiation pneumonitis in the etoposide plus cisplatin group; brain infarction in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group).

Hindlimb unloading (HU) is an animal model that simulates the physiological adaptations to spaceflight or bed-rest in humans. We hypothesized that HU would elicit anhedonia, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and increased arrhythmogenesis. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats confined to 10-14 days of HU, or casted control (CC) condition were surgically instrumented with indwelling vascular catheters, a radiotelemetry transmitter or an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrode. Anhedonia was measured through sucrose preference and the response to ICSS. Sequential autonomic blockade following administration of propranolol and atropine and time-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were used to measure sympathovagal balance. Cardiac arrhythmias were produced and scored following sympathetic stimulation (SS) via isoproterenol administration and brief handling/restraint. HU resulted in reductions in both sucrose preference and ICSS. Propranolol administration elicited a significantly greater bradycardia in HU vs. CC rats, while the tachycardic response to methyl-atropine was nearly abolished in HU rats. HU resulted in a significantly lower HRV and a greater arrhythmic burden following SS. Thus, HU elicits behavioral signs consistent with psychological depression, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and an increased vulnerability to cardiac arrhythmias.",Excluded
471,"A strategy for the use of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on linear accelerators and its impact on treatment margins for prostate cancer patients. Background and Purpose: In external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer, the consideration of various systematic error types leads to wide treatment margins compromising normal tissue tolerance. We investigated if systematic set-up errors can be reduced by a set of initial image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) sessions. Patients and Methods: 27 patients received daily IGRT resulting in a set of 882 cone-beam computed tomographies (CBCTs). After matching to bony structures, we analyzed the dimensions of remaining systematic errors from zero up to six initial IGRT sessions and aimed at a restriction of daily IGRT for 10% of all patients. For threshold definition, we determined the standard deviations (SD) of the shift corrections and selected patients out of this range for daily image guidance. To calculate total treatment margins, we demanded for a cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) coverage of at least 95% of the specified dose in 90% of all patients. Result(s): The gain of accuracy was largest during the first three IGRTs. In order to match precision and workload criteria, thresholds for the SD of the corrections of 3.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 4.5 mm in the left-right (L-R), cranial-caudal (C-C), and anterior-posterior (A-P) direction, respectively, were identified. Including all other error types, the total margins added to the CTV amounted to 8.6 mm in L-R, 10.4 mm in C-C, and 14.4 mm in A-P direction. Conclusion(s): Only initially performed IGRT might be helpful for eliminating gross systematic errors especially after virtual simulation. However, even with daily IGRT performance, a substantial PTV margin reduction is only achievable by matching internal markers instead of bony anatomical structures. © 2008 Urban & Vogel.",Excluded

1299,"A gene therapy/targeted radiotherapy strategy for radiation cell kill by. BACKGROUND: Although [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is currently one of the best agents available for targeted radiotherapy, its use is confined to a few neural crest derived tumours which accumulate the radiopharmaceutical via the noradrenaline transporter (NAT). To determine whether this drug could be used for the treatment of non-NAT expressing tumours following genetic manipulation, we previously showed that plasmid mediated transfection of NAT into a non-NAT expressing glioblastoma cell line, UVW, endowed the host cells with the capacity to actively accumulate [131I]MIBG. We now present data defining the conditions required for complete sterilisation of NAT transfected cells cultured as multicellular spheroids and treated with [131I]MIBG. METHOD(S): NAT transfected UVW cells, grown as monolayers and spheroids, were treated with various doses of [131I]MIBG and assessed for cell kill by clonogenic survival and measurement of spheroid volume over time (growth delay). Spheroids were left intact for different time periods to assess the effect of radiation crossfire on cell death. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Total clonogen sterilisation was observed when the cells were grown as three-dimensional spheroids and treated with 7 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. The added benefit of radiation crossfire was demonstrated by the improvement in cell kill achieved by prolongation of the maintenance of [131I]MIBG treated spheroids in their three-dimensional form, before disaggregation and clonogenic assay. When left intact for 48 h after treatment, spheroid cure was achieved by exposure to 6 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. These results demonstrate that the efficiency of cell kill by [131I]MIBG targeted therapy is strongly dependent on beta-particle crossfire irradiation. This gene therapy/targeted radiotherapy strategy has potential for [131I]MIBG mediated cell kill in tumours other than those derived from the neural crest.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The question of whether exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF), may contribute to cerebral cancer and neurodegeneration is of current interest. In this study we investigated whether exposure to ELF-MF (50 Hz-1 mT) harms cerebral DNA and induces expression of 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70).MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD1 mice were exposed to a MF (50 Hz-1 mT) for 1 or 7 days (15 h/day) and sacrificed either at the end of exposure or after 24 h. Unexposed and sham-exposed mice were used as controls. Mouse brains were dissected into cerebral cortex-striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum to evaluate primary DNA damage and hsp70 gene expression. Food intake, weight gain, and motor activity were also evaluated.RESULTS: An increase in primary DNA damage was detected in all cerebral areas of the exposed mice sacrificed at the end of exposure, as compared to controls. DNA damage, as can be evaluated by the comet assay, appeared to be repaired in mice sacrificed 24 h after a 7-day exposure. Neither a short (15 h) nor long (7 days) MF-exposure induced hsp70 expression, metabolic and behavioural changes.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in vivo ELF-MF induce reversible brain DNA damage while they do not elicit the stress response.",Excluded
1219,"Inhibition of PI3K signalling increases the efficiency of radiotherapy in glioblastoma cells. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumour, is also considered one of the most lethal cancers per se. It is highly refractory to therapeutic intervention, as highlighted by the mean patient survival of only 15 months, despite an aggressive treatment approach, consisting of maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radio- and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy, in particular, can have effects on the surviving fractions of tumour cells, which are considered adverse to the desired clinical outcome: It can induce increased cellular proliferation, as well as enhanced invasion. In this study, we established that differentiated glioblastoma cells alter their DNA repair response following repeated exposure to radiation and, therefore, high single-dose irradiation (SD-IR) is not a good surrogate marker for fractionated dose irradiation (FD-IR), as used in clinical practice. Integrating irradiation into a combination therapy approach, we then investigated whether the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling, the most abundantly activated survival cascade in glioblastoma, enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy. Of note, treatment with GDC-0941, which blocks PI3K-mediated signalling, did not enhance cell death upon irradiation, but both treatment modalities functioned synergistically to reduce the total cell number. Furthermore, GDC-0941 not only prevented the radiation-induced increase in the motility of the differentiated cells, but further reduced their speed below that of untreated cells. Therefore, combining radiotherapy with the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling is a potentially promising approach for the treatment of glioblastoma, as it can reduce the unwanted effects on the surviving fraction of tumour cells.",Excluded
2014,"Transgene expression in malignant glioma using a replication-defective adenoviral vector containing the Egr-1 promoter: activation by ionizing radiation or uptake of radioactive iododeoxyuridine. One approach to improving the specificity of gene therapy involves using radiosensitive promoters to activate gene expression selectively in the radiation field. In this study, we evaluated the ability of irradiation to regulate the transcription of a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vector, Ad.Egr-1/lacZ, containing the radiation-inducible Egr-1 promoter driving the beta-galactosidase reporter gene in glioma cells. Transcripts of the Egr-1 gene in human and rat glioma cells were induced following irradiation with as little as 2 Gy. This dose was 10-fold less than previously reported, and comparable to doses of irradiation used clinically in standard fractionated radiotherapy for brain tumors. When 9L rat gliosarcoma cells were infected with Ad.Egr-1/lacZ in vitro and exposed to 2 Gy of external beam irradiation, there was a threefold increase in beta-galactosidase expression. Irradiation of intracerebral 9L tumors infected with the Ad.Egr-1/lacZ virus, using either external beam radiotherapy (2 Gy) or the thymidine analog 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine radiolabeled with the Auger electron emitter iodine-125 ([125I]IdUrd), also resulted in increased beta-galactosidase activity of the tumor cells. These results indicate that the use of viral vectors containing radiation-inducible promoters represents a novel therapeutic approach that enables gene therapy to be spatially and temporally regulated by ionizing radiation. These findings also support a potential role for radiation-inducible promoters in the treatment of malignant brain tumors.",Excluded

3348,"Optimal timing and clinical value of radiotherapy in advanced ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with or without baseline brain metastases: implications from pattern of failure analyses. BACKGROUND: Despite development of several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib remains one of the first-line treatment options for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and is widely used in situations where next-generation TKIs aren't yet approved or economically inaccessible. However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown.METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions.",Excluded

Diverse circadian systems related to phylogeny and ecological adaptive strategies are proposed in teleosts. Recently, retinal photoreception was reported to be important for the circadian pacemaking activities of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. We aimed to confirm the photic and circadian responsiveness of its close relative-the Mozambique tilapia O. mossambicus. Melatonin production in cannulated or ophthalmectomized fish and its secretion from cultured pineal glands were examined under several light regimes. Melatonin production in the cannulated tilapias was measured at 3-h intervals; it fluctuated daily, with a nocturnal increase and a diurnal decrease. Exposing the cannulated fish to several light intensities (1500-0.1 lx) and to natural light (0.1 and 0.3 lx) suppressed melatonin levels within 30 min. Static pineal gland culture under light-dark and reverse light-dark cycles revealed that melatonin synthesis increased during the dark periods. Rhythmic melatonin synthesis disappeared on pineal gland culture under constant dark and light conditions. After ophthalmectomy, plasma melatonin levels did not vary with light-dark cycles. These results suggest that (1) Mozambique tilapias possess strong photic responsiveness, (2) their pineal glands are sensitive to light but lack circadian pacemaker activity, and (3) they require lateral eyes for rhythmic melatonin secretion from the pineal gland.",Excluded

By contrast, many thoracic imaging specialists may be underutilizing thoracic MRI. Recognizing the potential value of thoracic MRI to patient care, we set out to increase its utilization. Material(s) and Method(s): In late 2008 we began updating our nonvascular thoracic MR protocols, incorporating a combination of body and cardiac MRtechniques, creating a more high quality, interpretable examination by consultation with MR applications specialists and cardiac MR technologists and by imaging of volunteers. We reviewed MR protocol principles with our thoracic imaging division and began to show current MR cases regularly at our weekly thoracic imaging case conference. We educated our technologists with in-service presentations and hands-onMR imaging of volunteers to familiarize them with issues and challenges particular to thoracicMRimaging.We have trained our thoracic imaging fellows to protocol, monitor, and interpret these studies and have been educating our referring physicians about MR's value in increasing diagnostic specificity, guiding surgical approach, and preventing unnecessary interventional procedures without radiation exposure. We also retrospectively reviewed thoracic MR utilization from 2009 through 2012. Result(s): Our thoracic MR volume increased from 18 cases in 2009 to 88 cases in 2012 totalling 219 examinations over this period-182 mediastinal, 28 full chest, 5 focused pleural, 2 superior sulcus, and 2 combined neck/upper chest (these numbers exclude brachial plexus MRIs interpreted by our Musculoskeletal Imaging division). Indications included further characterization of thymic, other mediastinal, and pleural lesions, follow-up of thoracic lymphadenopathy, and assessment of chest wall/vascular invasion by lung cancer and mesothelioma. Internists requested 130/219 studies (59%) and surgeons requested 89/219 (41%), with many repeat referrals indicative of a new recognition of thoracic MR's value. Conclusion(s): With continuous updating of thoracic MR protocols, ongoing education of MR technologists and physicians, and incorporation of MR training into thoracic MR fellowship programs, the full contribution of thoracic MR to clinical practice can be realized. Clinical Implication: Improving thoracic MR protocols and educating technologists and physicians promote increased thoracic MR utilization and may improve patient care.",Excluded
3049,"Pain paroxysms with coronal radiation: Proposal of a new variant of epicrania fugax. Background and aims: Epicrania Fugax (EF) was included as a primary headache in the Appendix of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, beta version (ICHD-3 beta), among other entities pending further research. It was described as a paroxysmal head pain starting in a focal area located at a posterior cranial region and rapidly spreading forward to the ipsilateral eye or nose along a linear or zigzag trajectory. We aim to report 4 patients with brief pain paroxysms whose clinical features remind of typical epicrania fugax (EF), except for the direction along a transverse trajectory. Method(s): We considered all patients attending the headache outpatient office at 3 tertiary hospitals from March 2008 to December 2015. We identified a total of 4 cases with dynamic pain paroxysms moving in coronal direction. Result(s): The mean age at onset was 49 years (range 34-75). All the patients suffered a dynamic pain from parietal or temporal areas to the contralateral ones, crossing the midline, the entire sequence lasting 2-3 seconds. One patient noticed mild interictal tenderness at the stemming point. No triggers were identified. Pain quality was electric and intensity was graded as moderate. The frequency of the attacks varied from two per week to one every two months. The neurological examination, neuroimaging and laboratory tests were normal. Conclusion(s): We report 4 patients with a paroxysmal head pain moving with transverse radiation. Apart from this trajectory, the similarities to previous descriptions of EF are evident. It might probably correspond to a transverse variant or EF.",Excluded
1535,"Contribution of valine 7' of TMD2 to gating of neuronal alpha3 receptor subtypes. The second transmembrane domain (TMD2) of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels forms the channel pore. The functional role of the amino acid residues contributing to the channel pore in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors is not well understood. We characterized the contribution of TMD2 position V7' to channel gating in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute position alpha3 (V7') with four different amino acids (A, F, S, or Y) and coexpressed each mutant subunit with wild-type (WT) beta2 or beta4 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Whole-cell voltage clamp experiments show that substitution for an alanine, serine, or phenylalanine decreased by 2.3-6.2-fold the ACh-EC(50) for alpha3beta2 and alpha3beta4 receptor subtypes. Interestingly, mutation V7'Y did not produce a significant change in ACh-EC(50) when coexpressed with the beta2 subunit but showed a significant approximately two-fold increase with beta4. Similar responses were obtained with nicotine as the agonist. The antagonist sensitivity of the mutant channels was assessed by using dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) and methyllycaconitine (MLA). The apparent potency of DHbetaE as an antagonist increased by approximately 3.7- and 11-fold for the alpha3beta2 V7'S and V7'F mutants, respectively, whereas no evident changes in antagonist potency were observed for the V7'A and V7'Y mutants. The V7'S and V7'F mutations increase MLA antagonist potency for the alpha3beta4 receptor by approximately 6.2- and approximately 9.3-fold, respectively. The V7'A mutation selectively increases the MLA antagonist potency for the alpha3beta4 receptor by approximately 18.7-fold. These results indicate that position V7' contributes to channel gating kinetics and pharmacology of the neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors.",Excluded
583,"Oral mucositis. Mucositis and xerostomia are the most common oral complications of the non-surgical therapy of cancer. Mucositis, a common sequel of radio- (DXR), chemo-(CXR) and radiochemo-therapy in patients with cancer, or patients requiring haemopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT), has a direct and significant impact on the quality of life and cost of care, and also affects survival--because of the risk of infection. Apart from dose reduction, preventive and treatment options for mucositis are scarce, although multiple agents have been tested. Evidence suggests that cryotherapy, topical benzydamine and amifostine might provide some benefit in specific situations. The recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor Palifermin (Kepivance) was recently approved as a mucositis intervention in patients receiving conditioning regimens before HSCT for the treatment of haematological malignancies. A number of mechanistically based interventions are in various stages of development. Unfortunately, many other approaches have not been rigorously tested. This paper reviews the clinical features, prevalence, diagnosis, complications, pathogenesis, prophylaxis and management of mucositis. [References: 183]",Excluded

2981,"Treg/Tcon Immunotherapy and High Dose Marrow Irradiation Ensure Full Control of Leukemia Relapse in Haploidentical Transplantation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most powerful therapy for patients with high risk of relapse. In spite of that, no matter the donor source or conditioning regimen used, leukemia relapse is still the leading cause of HSCT failure. In HLA-haploidentical HSCT, we recently applied a clinical protocol consisting of total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen and a peripheral blood CD34+ cell graft combined with the adoptive transfer of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and conventional T cells (Tcons). No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. Such protocol was associated with low GvHD and relapse rate (Martelli et al., Blood 2014). To further reduce leukemia relapse in Treg/Tcon-based haploidentical HSCT (Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT) we used high dose hyper-fractionated TBI (HF-TBI) in the conditioning regimen. We also extended Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT to patients that are unfit (because of previous comorbidities) and/or too old to withstand high intensity regimens. In these patients the extra-hematologic toxicity of irradiation was reduced with the use of targeted total marrow and lymph node irradiation (TMLI). 40 patients with high risk acute leukemia (36 AML, 4 ALL) received Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT. All but 3 patients were transplanted in complete remission. 12 younger patients (median age: 28, range: 20-43) received HF-TBI, while 28 older or unfit patients (59, 40-70) received TMLI in the conditioning regimen. HF-TBI (14.4 Gy) was administered in 12 fractions, 3 times a day for 4 days. TMLI was administered by means of Helical Tomotherapy HI-ART (9 fractions, 2 times a day for 4.5 days). Irradiation was followed by chemotherapy with Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Cyclophosphamide. 2 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg freshly isolated CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs were transferred 4 days before the infusion of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg Tcons and a mega-dose of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. 38/40 patients engrafted. 12 (31%) developed aGvHD grade 32 (10 are alive and off-therapy). 6 (16%) died because of transplant related complications (2 because of aGvHD, 2 infections, 1 veno-occlusive disease, 1 intracranial hemorrhage). Strikingly, despite the high risk diseases, no patient relapsed after a median follow up of 13 months (range 1-36, Fig. A). Further, only 1 patient developed cGvHD. Thus, cGvHD/Leukemia-free survival was 82% (Fig. B). Treg adoptive transfer allows for the safe infusion of an otherwise lethal dose of donor alloreactive Tcons in the absence of any other form of immune suppression. Our results demonstrate that the potent graft versus leukemia effect of Treg/Tcon adoptive transfer was boosted by high dose marrow irradiation. Thus, this study proves that the right combination of haploidentical Treg/Tcon immunotherapy plus a powerful conditioning regimen can fully eradicate leukemia. Copyright © 2018",Excluded
1375,"Brain tumor vessel response to synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy: a short-term in vivo study. The aim of this work focuses on the description of the short-term response of a 9L brain tumor model and its vasculature to microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Rat 9L gliosarcomas implanted in nude mice brains were irradiated by MRT 13 days after tumor inoculation using two orthogonal arrays of equally spaced 28 planar microbeams (25 microm width, 211 microm spacing and dose 500 Gy). At 1, 7 and 14 days after MRT, apparent diffusion coefficient, blood volume and vessel size index were mapped by MRI. Mean survival time after tumor inoculation increased significantly between MRT-treated and untreated groups (23 and 28 days respectively, log-rank test, p < 0.0001). A significant increase of apparent diffusion coefficient was observed 24 h after MRT in irradiated tumors versus non-irradiated ones. In the untreated group, both tumor size and vessel size index increased significantly (from 7.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.2 +/- 4.0 mm(2) and +23%, respectively) between the 14th and the 21st day after tumor cell inoculation. During the same period, in the MRT-treated group, no difference in tumor size was observed. The vessel size index measured in the MRT-treated group increased significantly (+26%) between 14 and 28 days of tumor growth. We did not observe the significant difference in blood volume between the MRT-treated and untreated groups. MRT slows 9L tumor growth in a mouse brain but MRI results suggest that the increase in survival time after our MRT approach may be rather due to a cytoreduction than to early direct effects of ionizing radiation on tumor vessels. These results suggest that MRT parameters need to be optimized to further damage tumor vessels.",Excluded
1445,"High-dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM. Purpose/Objective(s): Ascorbate is a water soluble vitamin that has been previously shown at milli-molar concentrations to be selectively toxic to a variety of cancer cells, including high grade gliomas, while being innocuous to normal cells. In addition, in vivo experiments with human xenografts and human clinical trials with pancreas cancer demonstrated that high plasma concentrations of ascorbate (~20 mM) are well tolerated. Since ascorbate crosses the blood brain barrier, we hypothesized that high dose ascorbate would enhance chemo-radio-sensitization in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials/Methods: In order to determine if high dose ascorbate enhances GBM chemo-radio-sensitization, U87 and UI-581 human GBM cells were grown in vitro for 24 hrs and then exposed to 0.5 mM ascorbate and/or temozolomide 100 mmol/L for 1 hr followed by 2 Gy of concurrent irradiation. In the xenograft studies, U87 GBM cells were grown in the flanks of nude mice and treated with ascorbate (4 mg/kg; IP), and/or ionizing radiation (6 Gy x 2 fractions 48hrs apart) for 2 weeks. Tumor growth rates were assessed daily with calipers. Result(s): Both U87 and UI 581 cell lines demonstrated that ascorbate has an additive effect on radiation+temozolomide-induced cell killing in clonogenic cell survival analysis (p<0.05). In addition, ascorbate toxicity was completely inhibited (p<0.05) with the addition of catalase confirming that ascorbate toxicity is mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Mice with U87 GBM xenograft tumors treated with ascorbate and radiation demonstrated a significantly slower tumor growth rate compared to mice receiving radiation alone (p=0.031). Median survival in mice treated with radiation alone was 21 days while mice treated with ascorbate plus radiation was 28 days (p = 0.034). Conclusion(s): These experiments support the hypothesis that high dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM.",Excluded
817,"Clinical correlates of true progression versus treatment effect in brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Purpose: A substantial proportion of brain metastases treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) will subsequently grow on imaging, though often transiently. Optimal clinical management in such cases is hampered by an inability to reliably distinguish true progression (TP) from pseudoprogression with conventional imaging. Identifying clinical features associated with TP may aid clinical decision making. Methodology: Patients treated with SRS for brain metastases who subsequently underwent resection of treated lesions at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and radiation planning features were fitted into a multivariate logistic regression model to identify significant relationships with pure TP on pathology. Result(s): Seventy-five cases of treated brain metastases across 60 patients (median age: 57 years) met our inclusion criteria (Table 1). Prescribed dose range was 14-25 Gy in 1-5 fractions prescribed to 50-90% isodose line (IDL) with corresponding BED10 of 28-60Gy. Median time from SRS to subsequent resection was 255 days (range: 21-1351). Pathology showed pure TP in 39/75 surgical specimens (52%). Clinical covariates were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model with poorest predictors removed in step-wise fashion. Factors removed due to lesser significance (p > 0.3) included treatment machine, time from SRS, and radiation dose in BED10. For the final multivariate model, statistically significant predictors included small cell lung cancer (SCLC) pathology, infratentorial location, and increasing IDL (Table 2). (Table presented) Conclusion(s): SCLC histology, infratentorial location, and higher prescription IDL predicted for TP while prior WBRT showed a trend for predicting treatment effect in this institutional cohort. These data suggest that SCLC or infratentorial location may reflect a higher probability for local microscopic spread and marginal miss with SRS. The more gradual dose fall off and less centrally ablative dose associated with higher prescription IDLs also seemto correlate with lower rates of radionecrosis and increased odds of progression in this cohort. Validation in large independent datasets is warranted.",Excluded
2375,"Lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR): dosimetric considerations for chest wall toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate chest wall pain in patients with peripheral early stage lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and to identify factors predictive of Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events Grade 2 + chest wall pain.METHODS: Patients who received 55 Gy in five fractions were included. A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded
3178,"Therapeutic effect of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]iodobenzylguanidine on neuroblastoma multicellular tumor spheroids of different sizes. m-[l25I]iodobenzylguanidine (m-[125I]MIBG) has been suggested as an alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for the treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma to achieve a higher radiation dose in micrometastases. To compare these two radiopharmaceuticals, a mathematical model was developed in the present study that allows for the calculation of radiation dose rates within small spherical tumors for different distributions of 131I and 125I. Furthermore, the relationship between tumor size and the therapeutic effects of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG was studied in vitro using multicellular tumor spheroids of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. According to the calculations, higher mean dose rates can be achieved by m-[125I]MIBG than by m-[131I]MIBG up to a tumor diameter of 100 microm when both substances are homogeneously distributed within the tumor. In larger tumors, however, mean dose rates achieved by 131I are up to 8-fold higher. Evaluation of various activity distributions demonstrated that even in tumors of less than 100 microm in diameter, marked heterogeneities of the dose rate can occur when m-[125I]MIBG is not distributed homogeneously. By treatment with m-[131I]MIBG, the growth of tumor spheroids ranging from 100 to 250 microm in diameter was inhibited more effectively in the larger than in the smaller spheroids. The growth inhibition of spheroids treated with m-[125I]MIBG was independent of the spheroid size. In consistency with the calculations, the therapeutic effect of m-[125I]- and m-[131I]MIBG was equal in spheroids with diameters of about 100 microm. In larger spheroids, m-[131I]MIBG induced a more pronounced delay in spheroid growth than m-[125I]MIBG. According to these calculations and in vitro data, m-[125I]MIBG as a single agent does not seem to be a promising alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma. However, the combined use of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG may be more effective than treatment with m-[131I]MIBG alone.",Excluded
692,"Therapeutic effects of minimally invasive adjustable and locking compression plate for unstable pelvic fractures via posterior approach. OBJECTIVE: Unstable pelvic fractures are clinically complex injuries. Selecting appropriate treatment remains a challenging problem for orthopedic physicians. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of minimally invasive adjustable plate and locking compression plate in treatment of unstable pelvic fractures via posterior approach.METHODS: From January 2009 to June 2012, fifty-six patients with unstable pelvic fractures were included. After at least 12-month follow-up, forty-four patients treated with two methods were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: minimally invasive adjustable plate (group A) and locking compression plate (group B). Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. The size of incision, operation duration, blood loss, duration of X-ray exposures, Majeed postoperative functional evaluation and Lindahl postoperative reduction evaluation were analyzed.RESULTS: The mean follow-up in group A was 27.3 months (range, 13-48 months), and that in group B was 21.8 months (range, 12-42 months). There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries during the operations in the two groups. In group B, malunion was observed in one patient, and infection of incision was observed in one case. The operation duration, blood loss, and size of incision of group A were significantly less than that of group B. There was no significant difference in the duration of X-ray exposures between the two groups. The Majeed functional evaluation score in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. The difference of the imaging score of the retained displacement was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Both the two methods can effectively stabilize the unstable pelvic fractures. However, the minimally invasive adjustable plate has the advantages of minimally invasive, less radiation exposure, technically safe and time saving. Minimally invasive adjustable plate is a good supplementary option for treating posterior pelvic ring injuries.",Excluded
1920,"Tumor stage dependent contribution of bone marrow derived cells to tumor neo-vascularization. Introduction: The role of bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) in tumor neo-vascularization remains controversial. We have previously demonstrated that BMDC contribute to tumor neovascularization by differentiating into vascular support cells and not endothelial cell. In this study we focus on establishing the spatiotemporal role of BMDC in tumor neovascularisation, focusing on whether it is a tumor growth stage dependent process and more specifically examining the patterns of BMDC integration into tumor vasculature in response to radiation therapy (RTx). Method(s): Animal Models: Bone marrow of NOD/SCID mice were stably reconstituted with BM harvested from green-fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice. Intracranial (ic) xenografts were generated in intracranial window models (ICW) using a panel of glioma cell and breast cancer cells stably expressing mCherry. In-vivo imaging: Two-photon laser capture microscopy was used to obtain high-resolution real-time in-vivo longitudinal images of the tumor cells, tumor vasculature and tracing of the circulating GFP+BM cells. Mice were imaged 1d,2d,3d,7d,10d,14d,21d & <sup>30</sup>d following cell implantation or RTx. Brain Tumor Analysis: Mice were sacrificed using perfusion fixation and brains collected for correlative immunohistochemical and Immunofluorscent confocal analysis. RTx: Using in-house designed x-ray micro-irradiator stereotactic radiation was delivered through ICW to ic-xenografts, treated with either 3x2Gy or 3x5Gy. Tumor+RTx was compared to RTx alone or tumor alone (n=15 each arm). Result(s): At early stages of tumor formation (<1wk) there is 90% integration of BMDC into the tumor vasculature, while to late stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) only 10% integration of BMDC is seen. At later stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) BMDC incorporation in the tumor vasculature is predominantly seen in the tumor periphery compared to the tumor centre, with the peripheral vessels demonstrating almost 100% integration of BMDC compared to the centre of the tumor where the vasculature have no integration of BMDC. Conclusion(s): Our results are the first to demonstrate that there is a specific tumor growth stage dependent contribution of BMDC to tumor neo-vascularization. At early stages of tumor growth neo-ascularization relies on host BMDC, while at later stages of tumor growth vascularization relies on branching of pre-existing vessels. A significant difference in extent of BMDC integration is noted between periphery versus the centre of the tumor, suggesting that the internal tumor micro-environment regulates neoascularization differently from the periphery. Intriguingly, this distinction is not seen with tumor neovascularization in recurrent tumors following RTx. These results have significant therapeutic implications and point to a need for scheduling of anti-angiogenic therapies according to tumor growth stage and timing post RTx.",Excluded
2988,"Dynamics of Ca(2+) and Na(+) in the dendrites of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells evoked by parallel fibre stimulation. Ca2+ and Na+ play important roles in neurons, such as in synaptic plasticity. Their concentrations in neurons change dynamically in response to synaptic inputs, but their kinetics have not been compared directly. Here, we show the mechanisms and dynamics of Ca2+ and Na+ transients by simultaneous monitoring in Purkinje cell dendrites in mouse cerebellar slices. High frequency parallel fibre stimulation (50 Hz, 3-50-times) depolarized Purkinje cells, and Ca2+ transients were observed at the anatomically expected sites. The magnitude of the Ca2+ transients increased linearly with increasing numbers of parallel fibre inputs. With 50 stimuli, Ca2+ transients lasted for seconds, and the peak [Ca2+] reached approximately 100 microm, which was much higher than that reported previously, although it was still confined to a part of the dendrite. In contrast, Na+ transients were sustained for tens of seconds and diffused away from the stimulated site. Pharmacological interventions revealed that Na+ influx through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and Ca2+ influx through P-type Ca channels were essential players, that AMPA receptors did not operate as a Ca2+ influx pathway and that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphate receptors or ryanodine receptors did not contribute greatly to the large Ca2+ transients.",Excluded
2448,"Analysis of factors affecting adjuvant radiation therapy timing in sinonasal malignancies. Introduction: Delays in initiation of adjuvant therapy are associated with poorer outcomes in patients who have undergone oncological resection for head and neck malignancy. There are many potential factors that can contribute to these delays, but unique to cancers that involve the base of skull is the potential to create communications that produce a leak in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). This study aims to evaluate variables that may produce delays in postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy for patients undergoing sinonasal malignancy surgery. Method(s): After approval from our institutional review board, a single-institution retrospective review of all patients undergoing endoscopic or open surgery for sinonasal malignancies from January 2007 to December 2017 were identified. Clinically relevant data, including basic demographics, tumor characteristics, procedure details, postoperative course and interested dates were tabulated. The covariates of surgical approach, tumor T stage (T1/2 vs. T3/4), reconstruction type, presence of an intraoperative CSF leak, and geographic location of radiation therapy were analyzed to see if they significantly impacted time to initiation of radiation therapy. Result(s): Of the 361 patients found on initial screening, 36 were identified to have a surgically resected primary sinonasal malignancy followed by radiation or chemoradiation therapy. Of these, 2 were excluded for incomplete data. The average number of days from surgery to initiation of radiation therapy was 50 (range: 21-86). No difference was found comparing endoscopic to open surgery (p = 0.80, CI: -12.6 to 9.9), tumor stage (p = 0.66, CI: -14.6 to 22.18), reconstruction method (p = 0.86), presence of an intraoperative CSF leak (p = 0.18, CI: -19.2 to 3.8), occurrence of an immediate postoperative complication (p = 0.36, CI: -19.7 to 7.3), or geographic location of radiation therapy (p = 0.10, CI: -26.8 to 2.6). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that adequate surgical resection, including base of skull resection with the potential of encountering a CSF leak, achieved by the appropriate approach and robust reconstruction for all tumor stages does not delay initiation of radiation therapy in sinonasal malignancies.",Excluded
2990,"Non-thermal resistive switching in Mott insulator nanowires.

3475,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report). Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC.",Excluded

After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED. Conclusion(s): MWI might detect early white matter radiation-induced alterations, providing additional information to DTI, which might improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the radiation damage.

1068,"Load Dependency of Postural Control--Kinematic and Neuromuscular Changes in Response to over and under Load Conditions. INTRODUCTION: Load variation is associated with changes in joint torque and compensatory reflex activation and thus, has a considerable impact on balance control. Previous studies dealing with over (OL) and under loading (UL) used water buoyancy or additional weight with the side effects of increased friction and inertia, resulting in substantially modified test paradigms. The purpose of this study was to identify gravity-induced load dependency of postural control in comparable experimental conditions and to determine the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms.METHODS: Balance performance was recorded under normal loading (NL, 1 g), UL (0.16 g 0.38 g) and OL (1.8 g) in monopedal stance. Center of pressure (COP) displacement and frequency distribution (low 0.15-0.5 Hz (LF), medium 0.5-2 Hz (MF), high 2-6 Hz (HF)) as well as ankle, knee and hip joint kinematics were assessed. Soleus spinal excitability was determined by H/M-recruitment curves (H/M-ratios).RESULTS: Compared to NL, OL caused an increase in ankle joint excursion, COP HF domain and H/M-ratio. Concomitantly, hip joint excursion and COP LF decreased. Compared to NL, UL caused modulations in the opposite direction: UL decreased ankle joint excursions, COP HF and H/M-ratio. Collaterally, hip joint excursion and COP LF increased. COP was augmented both in UL and in OL compared to NL.CONCLUSION: Subjects achieved postural stability in OL and UL with greater difficulty compared to NL. Reduced postural control was accompanied by modified balance strategies and compensatory reflex activation. With increasing load, a shift from hip to ankle strategy was observed. Accompanying, COP frequency distribution shifted from LF to HF and spinal excitability was enhanced. It is suggested that in OL, augmented ankle joint torques are compensated by quick reflex-induced postural reactions in distal muscles. Contrarily, UL is associated with diminished joint torques and thus, postural equilibrium may be controlled by the proximal segments to adjust the center of gravity above the base of support.",Excluded
265,"Upper gastrointestinal bleed as a manifestation of poorly differentiated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis from primary lung cancer is a rare clinical finding. Lung cancer most often metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, and adrenal glands; with gastrointestinal involvement being very rare. We report a case of a 39-year-old female with a diagnosis of poorly differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the lung presenting with dizziness and melena. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a bleeding mass in the stomach. Final biopsy report and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the specimen were consistent with SCC lung metastasis. While it is imperative to have a high clinical suspicion for GI metastasis in patients with primary lung cancer presenting with GI symptoms, it may be challenging to establish diagnosis. Endoscopy along with pathology and immunohistochemistry play a crucial role in differentiating primary GI malignancies from metastasis. Copyright © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

PURPOSE: Due to its role in learning, memory and in many neurodegenerative diseases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) represents an interesting endpoint to assess possible targets of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) generated by mobile phones. We investigated possible alterations of enzymatic activity, gene and protein expression of AChE in neuronal-like cells exposed to a 1.8 GHz Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modulated signal (217-GSM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat PC12 cells were exposed for 24 h to 1.8 GHz 217-GSM signal. Specific adsorption rate (SAR) was 2 W/kg. AChE enzyme activity was assessed spectrophotometrically by Ellman's method, mRNA expression level was evaluated by real time polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression was assessed by Western blotting.RESULTS: AChE enzymatic activity increased of 1.4-fold in PC12 cells exposed to 217-GSM signal for 24 h, whilst AChE transcriptional or translational pathways were not affected.CONCLUSION: Our results provide the first evidence of effects on AChE activity after in vitro exposure of mammalian cells to the RF-EMF generated by GSM mobile phones, at the SAR value 2 W/kg. The obtained evidence promotes further investigations on AChE as a possible target of RF-EMF and confirm the ability of 1.8 GHz 217-GSM signal to induce biological effects in different mammalian cells.",Excluded
276,"Copper alters aggregation behavior of prion protein and induces novel interactions between its N- and C-terminal regions. Copper is reported to promote and prevent aggregation of prion protein. Conformational and functional consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to prion protein (PrP) are not well understood largely because most of the Cu(2+)-binding studies have been performed on fragments and truncated variants of the prion protein. In this context, we set out to investigate the conformational consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to full-length prion protein (PrP) by isothermal calorimetry, NMR, and small angle x-ray scattering. In this study, we report altered aggregation behavior of full-length PrP upon binding to Cu(2+). At physiological temperature, Cu(2+) did not promote aggregation suggesting that Cu(2+) may not play a role in the aggregation of PrP at physiological temperature (37 degreeC). However, Cu(2+)-bound PrP aggregated at lower temperatures. This temperature-dependent process is reversible. Our results show two novel intra-protein interactions upon Cu(2+)-binding. The N-terminal region (residues 90-120 that contain the site His-96/His-111) becomes proximal to helix-1 (residues 144-147) and its nearby loop region (residues 139-143), which may be important in preventing amyloid fibril formation in the presence of Cu(2+). In addition, we observed another novel interaction between the N-terminal region comprising the octapeptide repeats (residues 60-91) and helix-2 (residues 174-185) of PrP. Small angle x-ray scattering studies of full-length PrP show significant compactness upon Cu(2+)-binding. Our results demonstrate novel long range inter-domain interactions of the N- and C-terminal regions of PrP upon Cu(2+)-binding, which might have physiological significance.",Excluded

Preclinical data have demonstrated that ionizing radiation acts synergistically with capecitabine. This report retrospectively assessed the use of capecitabine concurrently with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. From January 2003 to March 2005, five breast cancer patients with brain metastases were referred for WBRT with concurrent capecitabine. Median age was 44 years (range: 38-53). The median dose of capecitabine was 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days (day1-14). Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days, concurrently with WBRT (30 Gy, 3 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week). Median survival after starting WBRT plus capecitabine was 6.5 months (range 1-34 months). One patient achieved a complete response. Two patients achieved partial response, including one with local control lasting until most recent follow-up. One patient had stable disease. The remaining patient was not assessable for response because of early death. Most commonly reported adverse events were nausea (n = 2) and headache (n = 2), always grade 1. Other toxicities were grade 3 hand/foot syndrome (n = 1), moderate anemia requiring transfusion and dose reduction of capecitabine (n = 1), and grade 1 mucositis (n = 1). Although promising, these preliminary data warrant further assessment of capecitabine-based chemoradiation in brain metastases from breast cancer and need to be further validated in the setting of a clinical trial.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Current therapies for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction offer discouraging results in alleviating low back pain. The innervation and target nerves for radiofrequency denervation (RFD) of the SIJ remain unclear. We present a prospective case series on the treatment of intractable SIJ dysfunction with pulsed radiofrequency denervation (PRFD) of lateral branches from L4-S3.INTERVENTIONS: A total of 126 patients with presumptive SIJ dysfunction based on history and physical examination underwent arthrographically confirmed steroid/local anesthetic SIJ injection. Fifty-two patients (41.3%) had >75% pain relief after two consecutive injections, physical therapy, repeated SIJ injections, and/or analgesics. Twenty-two patients failed to respond. These patients underwent PRFD of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2.OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog score (VAS) and quality of life (QOL) assessments were performed prior to and after treatment.RESULTS: Sixteen patients (72.7%) experienced ""Good"" (>50% reduction in VAS), or ""Excellent"" (>80% reduction in VAS) pain relief following PRFD. Duration of pain relief range was 6-9 weeks in four patients, 10-16 weeks in five patients, and 17-32 weeks in seven patients. In addition, QOL scores improved significantly in all measured categories. Six patients (26.1%) did not respond to PRFD and had less than 50% reduction in VAS and were considered failures.CONCLUSIONS: PRFD of the lateral branch of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2 is an effective treatment for some patients with SIJ pain unresponsive to other forms of therapy.",Excluded

3218,"Impact of Early Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation With Hippocampal Avoidance on Neurocognitive Function in Patients With Limited Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer. A Multicenter Phase 2 Trial (SAKK 15/12). PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate neurocognitive function (NCF) and clinical outcomes after early hippocampal avoidance (HA) prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited disease (LD) small cell lung cancer (SCLC).METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a phase 2 trial, patients with LD SCLC received HA-PCI concomitant with the second cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy. All patients underwent objective NCF testing at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months after HA-PCI. NCF tests included Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised, Controlled Oral Word Association, and Trail Making Tests A and B. The primary endpoint was NCF decline at 6 months after HA-PCI. We assumed <=30% of patients with no NCF decline to be unpromising. Secondary endpoints included brain metastases-free survival (BMFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of the concomitant treatment.RESULTS: Among the 44 patients enrolled in the trial, 38 had evaluable NCF assessment at 6 months after HA-PCI. The proportion of evaluable patients showing no NCF decline at 6 and 12 months was 34.2% (90% confidence interval [CI], 21.6-48.8) and 48.5% (95% CI, 30.8-66.5), respectively. Median follow-up was 13.2 months (95% CI, 12.6-14.1). At 12 months, BMFS was 84.2% and OS was 87.7% (95% CI, 73.0-94.7). Four patients died of SCLC, 1 of respiratory failure, 1 of hemorrhage, and 1 for unknown reason. The most frequently reported grade >=3 acute adverse events were anemia (21.4%), febrile neutropenia (19.1%), and fatigue (14.3%).CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients showing no NCF decline 6 and 12 months after early HA-PCI does not appear to be better than, but rather similar to, that observed in patients receiving sequential PCI without HA. Early HA-PCI in LD SCLC is feasible, with observation of promising BMFS and OS in this selected population.",Excluded
2576,"Spreading depression elicited by thermal effects of ultrasonic irradiation of cerebral cortex in rats. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was elicited by focused ultrasonic irradiation (800 kHz) of exposed cerebral cortex in anesthetized rats. With the acoustic output of 0.64 W at the probe-tissue contact (3 mm in diameter), CSD was elicited after 28-sec irradiation in normothermic rats. Reduction of cortical temperature to 31 degrees C increased the threshold irradiation time to 82 sec on the average. Ten- to thirty-sec heating of cerebral cortex with a thermode elicited CSD when surface temperature exceeded 47 degrees C. Histological examination of the cortical areas exposed to threshold irradiation revealed a central coagulation lesion surrounded by edema. It is concluded that the ultrasonic irradiation elicits CSD by dissipated heat. Differences in threshold duration of irradiation in hypothermic and normothermic rats were used to compute the threshold temperature which had to be exceeded in the critical volume of cortex in order to start CSD.",Excluded
2010,"Type-specific photoreceptor loss in pigeons after disruption of parasympathetic control of choroidal blood flow by the medial subdivision of the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal. The medial part of the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal (EWM) in birds mediates light-regulated adaptive increases in choroidal blood flow (ChBF). We sought to characterize the effect of loss of EWM-mediated ChBF regulation on photoreceptor health in pigeons housed in either moderate intensity diurnal or constant light (CL). Photoreceptor abundance following complete EWM destruction was compared to that following a lesion in the pupil control circuit (as a control for spread of EWM lesions to the nearby pupil-controlling lateral EW) or following no EW damage. Birds were housed post-lesion in a 12 h 400 lux light/12 h dark light cycle for up to 16.5 months, or in constant 400 lux light for up to 3 weeks. Paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixed eyes were embedded in plastic, sectioned, slide-mounted, and stained with toluidine blue/azure II. Blinded analysis of photoreceptor outer segment abundance was performed, with outer segment types distinguished by oil droplet tint and laminar position. Brains were examined histologically to assess lesion accuracy. Disruption of pupil control had no adverse effect on photoreceptor outer segment abundance in either diurnal light or CL, but EWM destruction led to 50-60% loss of blue/violet cone outer segments in both light conditions, and a 42% loss of principal cone outer segments in CL. The findings indicate that adaptive regulation of ChBF by the EWM circuit plays a role in maintaining photoreceptor health and mitigates the harmful effect of light on photoreceptors, especially short wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors.",Excluded
2515,"Computerized tomography perfusion predictors of clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Objective: Computerized Tomography Perfusion (CTP) is used to assess physiological brain tissue parameters in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Its utility for patients presenting within the 3 hrs time window is unknown and questionable given possible delay of thrombolytic administration and additional exposure to radiation. We addressed whether parameters on CTP for AIS patients treated with IV t-PA within 3 hrs of onset are predictive of good or bad outcome. Method(s): We retrospectively identified patients from our stroke registry (7/07 to 2/10) who presented with AIS and underwent CTP and then received tPA within 3 hrs of symptom onset. Patients that underwent intra-arterial therapy were excluded. A neuroradiologist blinded to outcome performed CTP measurements on a commercially available Siemens Neuro PCT workstation. Total perfusion deficit was defined as the area of infarct territory with a relative time to peak greater than 4s compared to the contralateral side (TTP). Nonviable tissue (NVT) was defined as the area of infarct territory with absolute cerebral blood volume (CBV) less than 2ml/100g. Penumbra was defined as the area of TTP minus the area of CBV. Good clinical outcome (GCO) was defined as mRS 0-2, and poor clinical outcome (PCO) was defined as mRS 5-6 at hospital discharge. Clinical perfusion mismatch (CPM) was defined as admit NIHSS >= 8 and NVT <=25cm<sup>2</sup>. Result(s): We identified 44 patients with a mean age of 68 years , median NIHSS on admission of 13 and median discharge mRS of 4. NVT was statistically different in those with poor outcome (Table 1) and a strong predictor of poor outcome when NVT was greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup> (OR=6 , 95%CI: 1.05-34, p=0.044). TTP was statistically different in patients that achieved and did not achieve GCO (Table 1; OR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.95- 1, p=0.037). There was no statistical correlation between penumbra area, percentage penumbra, and CPM with GCO in univariate analysis. Younger age and lower admission NIHSS were associated with GCO and higher NIHSS was associated with PCO. Using multivariate logistic regression controlling for age and admission NIHSS, none of the CTP parameters were statistically associated with outcome measures. Conclusion(s): CTP parameters derived from commercially available software and published thresholds do not provide useful value beyond the NIHSS for predicting good outcome for AIS patients treated with IV tPA within 3 hours of onset but may be useful in predicting poor outcome if the area of non-viable tissue is greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup>.

Patients who received biopsy only were excluded. The time from surgery to initiation of radiation therapy was divided into 4 equal quartiles of <=24, 25 to 30, 31 to 37, and >37 d. Patient characteristics were compared between groups using Pearson Chi Square and Fisher's Exact test. OS was analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared via the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression were performed to assess for impact of covariables on OS.RESULTS: A total of 11 652 patients were included in the analysis. Median duration from surgery to radiation was 30 d. On multivariable regression, black race, larger tumor, gross-total resection, methyguanine-methyl transferase (MGMT+), and treatment at an academic facility were associated with a duration >30 d.

The accelerator driven subcritical system (ADS) is regarded as a safe and clean nuclear power system, which can be used for the transmutation of nuclear waste and the breeding of nuclear fuel. In this study, in order to validate nuclear data and the neutron transportation performance of the materials related to ADS, we measured the leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies using 14.8 MeV D-T neutrons. Two types of assemblies comprising A-1 (W+U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) and A-2 (U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) were both built up gradually starting with the first wall. The measured spectra were compared with those calculated using the Monte Carlo code neutron transport coed (MCNP)-4C. A comparison of the results showed that the experimental leakage neutron spectra for both A-1 or A-2 were reproduced well by the three evaluated nuclear data libraries with discrepancies of less than 15% (A-1) and 12% (A-2), except when below 3 MeV. For 2-cm and 5-cm uranium samples, the CENDL-3.1 calculations exhibited large discrepancies in the energy range of 2-8 MeV and above 13 MeV. Thus, the CENDL-3.1 library for uranium should be reevaluated, especially around this energy range.

3171,"Radiotherapy in Combination with Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Is a Safe and Promising Approach in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Patients with High Tumor Burden. Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) for localized-refractory or relapsed (R/R) DLBCL after chemotherapy is a standard therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy is demonstrated as a novel immunotherapy modality with impressive efficacy in R/R B-cell malignancies including DLBCL. However, CAR-T therapy is also associated with potentially fatal toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities. Whether radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T is a better approach to enhancing efficacy and decreasing toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden remains unknown. Materials/Methods: Human CD3+T cells were separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMS) of patients or donors by degradable anti-CD3 magnetic microbeads followed by 24h stimulation with CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody (5ug/ml). Then CD3+T cells were transduced with humanized CAR construct targeting CD19, CD20 and CD22 and further expanded for 7 to 10 days in vitro. 14 patients with high tumor burden R/R DLBCL were enrolled in the study. Patients from 39 to 66 years of age had received two to four prior lines of therapy. 7 patients received intensive second-line chemotherapy (median age, 46 years) and 7 received radiotherapy (median age, 63 years) to debulking tumor after leukapheresis and during CAR-T cells preparation. Intensive combined chemotherapy or radiation (40 Gy in 20 fractions) were carried out for debulking condition after sequential FC regimen (cyclophosphamide 300mg/m<sup>2</sup> and fludarabine 30mg/m<sup>2</sup> X 3d) for lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Two days after FC regimen, CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD20 or CD22 at average dose of 1-2x10<sup>7</sup> cells for each target per kilogram (kg) were infused within 3 days. Result(s): Severe CRS (grade 3/4/5) was reported in all patients of chemotherapy cohort and mild CRS (grade 1/2) was reported in all patients of radiation cohort. 4 patients (57.1%) in chemotherapy cohort showed neurological toxicity while no patient in radiation cohort showed neurological toxicity. Comparable hematological/non-hematological toxicity and non-neurological toxicity were observed in both two groups. In chemotherapy cohort, four of seven (57.1%) patients achieved an objective response after CAR-T infusion with three of seven (42.9%) achieving a CR. In radiation cohort, seven of seven (100%) achieved an objective response after CAR-T therapy with four of seven (57.1%) achieving a CR. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that compared to intensive second-line chemotherapy, radiation is a better approach with enhanced efficacy and decreased toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden. Radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T cell infusion may be the optimal alternative treatment model of R/R DLBCL with high tumor burden. Copyright © 2019",Excluded

The anti-emetic efficiency of orally administered ondansetron and granisetron has been tested in macaques exposed to a mixed y and neutron radiation (6 Gy) with a high neutron/gamma-ray ratio. Our experiments reveal that a single delivery of ondansetron (1 or 2 mg kg(-1)) or of granisetron (0.25 mg kg(-1)) 45-90 min before irradiation or 35-45 min after irradiation was not totally effective. Conversely, the delivery of two doses with the same delay prior to and after exposure led to a complete prevention of vomiting and retching. These observations can be explained by the dual mechanism of radiation-induced emesis: an early peripheral mechanism and a later central mechanism. Two deliveries of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists seem to disrupt serotonergic transmission at the brain stem structures and to affect the peripheral release of serotonin from the gut, thus completely preventing radiation-induced vomiting. This study confirms that the 5-HT3-dependent mechanisms that mediate emesis are similar for both neutron and gamma radiation.",Excluded

Purpose: Total scalp irradiation (TSI) is a rare but challenging indication. We previously reported that non-coplanar intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was superior to coplanar IMRT in organ-at-risk (OAR) protection and target dose distribution. This consecutive treatment planning study compared IMRT with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective treatment plan databank search was performed and 5 patient cases were randomly selected. Cranial imaging was restored from the initial planning computed tomography (CT) and target volumes and OAR were redelineated. For each patients, three treatment plans were calculated (coplanar/non-coplanar IMRT, VMAT; prescribed dose 50 Gy, single dose 2 Gy). Conformity, homogeneity and dose volume histograms were used for plan. Result(s): VMAT featured the lowest monitor units and the sharpest dose gradient (1.6 Gy/mm). Planning target volume (PTV) coverage and homogeneity was better in VMAT (coverage, 0.95; homogeneity index [HI], 0.118) compared to IMRT (coverage, 0.94; HI, 0.119) but coplanar IMRT produced the most conformal plans (conformity index [CI], 0.43). Minimum PTV dose range was 66.8%- 88.4% in coplanar, 77.5%-88.2% in non-coplanar IMRT and 82.8%-90.3% in VMAT. Mean dose to the brain, brain stem, optic system (maximum dose) and lenses were 18.6, 13.2, 9.1, and 5.2 Gy for VMAT, 21.9, 13.4, 14.5, and 6.3 Gy for non-coplanar and 22.8, 16.5, 11.5, and 5.9 Gy for coplanar IMRT. Maximum optic chiasm dose was 7.7, 8.4, and 11.1 Gy (non-coplanar IMRT, VMAT, and coplanar IMRT). Conclusion(s): Target coverage, homogeneity and OAR protection, was slightly superior in VMAT plans which also produced the sharpest dose gradient towards healthy tissue. Copyright © 2016.

979,"Cutaneous pain and detection thresholds to short CO2 laser pulses in humans: evidence on afferent mechanisms and the influence of varying stimulus conditions. Pain and detection thresholds to short CO2 laser pulses were studied in healthy human subjects. Pain thresholds were significantly higher than detection thresholds in both hairy and glabrous skin; in the glabrous skin both thresholds were higher in the hairy skin. The range from detection threshold to pain threshold was larger in the glabrous skin. The minimal energy per surface area needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation decreased with increasing stimulus surface, and this spatial summation effect was to equal magnitude in the hairy and the glabrous skin. With decreasing stimulus pulse duration (from 45 to 15 msec) the detection and pain thresholds were elevated: this effect was stronger on pain thresholds. With increasing adapting skin temperature, less energy was needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation. The effect of adapting skin temperature was equal on pain and detection thresholds. The conduction velocity of fibers mediating laser evoked first sensations was in the thin fiber range (less than 10 msec), according to a reaction time study. The results suggest that short CO2 laser pulses produce both non-pain and pain sensations, but that both these sensations are based on the activation of the same primary afferent fiber population of slowly conducting nociceptive fibers. Central summation of primary afferent impulses is needed to elicit a liminal non-painful sensation, and an increased number of impulses in the same fibers produces pain.",Excluded

3193,"Effects of cediranib (VEGF signaling inhibitor) on edema in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients during initial chemoradiation. Background: A significant benefit of antiangiogenic therapy is control of brain edema. We evaluated the impact of adding cediranib to standard chemoradiation (CRT) on peritumoral edema in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma(GBM) during the initial 6 weeks of CRT. Method(s): Two cohorts of patients were enrolled in two clinical trials. The control group (N=13) received radiation for 6 weeks plus temozolomide. The cediranib (CED) group received standard CRT plus daily cediranib (N=34). MRIs were performed at baseline and weekly during CRT. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn outlining the enhancing tumor on T1-weighted post contrast images and the abnormal FLAIR hyperintensity. ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps were calculated from diffusion-weighted images and histograms of the distribution of ADC values created for each visit using the baseline FLAIR VOI to characterize the peritumoraledema. Patients were on stable or decreasing doses of steroids. Result(s): In the CED group, T1 and FLAIR VOI decreased during CRT vs controls where T1 VOI did not change and FLAIR VOI increased. By the end of CRT, the mode of the ADC histogram in the CED group shifted to the left while the mode of the controls shifted to the right. The skewness, a measure of asymmetry of the distribution, increased in the CED group and decreased in controls. Conclusion(s): In patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with CRT and cediranib, tumor volume decreased on T1 and FLAIR images whereas the FLAIR volume significantly increased in the control group suggesting increased edema. The shift of mode to the right and decreasing skewness in controls (indicating an increase in the proportion of very high ADC values) suggests that adding cediranibprevented the development of edema and contributed to the resolution of existing edema. Preventing the edema by adding anti-VEGF treatment may improve the tolerability of CRT for GBM patients. (Table presented) .",Excluded

1602,"Laser evoked potentials for assessing sensory neuropathy in human patients. Sensory neuropathy usually impairs tactile sensations related to large myelinated afferents (Abeta) as well as thermal-pain sense related to small myelinated (Adelta) and unmyelinated (C) afferents. By selectively affecting large or small fibres, some sensory neuropathies may also provoke a dissociated sensory loss. Standard nerve conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potentials assess Abeta-fibre function only. Laser pulses selectively excite free nerve endings in the superficial skin layers and evoke Adelta-related brain potentials (LEPs). From earlier studies and new cases we collected data on 270 patients with sensory neuropathy. LEPs often disclosed subclinical dysfunction of Adelta fibres and proved a sensitive and reliable diagnostic tool for assessing small-fibre function in sensory neuropathy. [References: 24]",Excluded
466,"Performance and brain electrical activity during prolonged confinement. A subset of the AGARD-STRES battery including memory search, unstable tracking, and a combination of both tasks (dual-task), was applied repeatedly to the four chamber crew members before, during, and after the 60-day isolation period of EXEMSI. Five ground control group members served as a control group. A subjective state questionnaire was also included. The results were subjected to a quantitative single-subject analysis. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded to permit correlation of changes in task performance with changes in the physiological state. Evaluation of the EEG focused on spectral parameters of spontaneous EEG waves. No physiological data were collected from the control group. Significant decrements in tracking ability were observed in the chamber crew. The time course of these effects followed a triphasic pattern with initial deterioration, intermediate recovery to pre-isolation baseline scores after the first half of the isolation period, and a second deterioration towards the end. None of the control group subjects displayed such an effect. Memory search (speed and accuracy) was only occasionally impaired during isolation, but the control group displayed a similar pattern of changes. It is suggested that a state of decreased alertness causes tracking deterioration, which leads to a reduced efficiency of sustained cue utilization. The assumption of low alertness was further substantiated by higher fatigue ratings by the chamber crew compared to those of the control group. Analysis of the continuous EEG recordings revealed that only two subjects produced reliable alpha wave activity (8-12 Hz) over Pz and, to a much smaller extent, Fz-theta wave activity (5-7 Hz) during task performance. In both subjects Pz-alpha power decreased consistently under task conditions involving single-task and dual-task tracking. Fz-theta activity was increased more by single-task and dual-task memory search than by single-task tracking. The alpha attenuation appears to be associated with an increasing demand on perceptual cue utilization required by the tracking performance. In one subject marked attenuation of alpha power occurred during the first half of the confinement period, where he also scored the highest fatigue ratings. A striking increase in fronto-central theta activity was observed in the same subject after six weeks of isolation. The change was associated with an efficient rather than a degraded task performance, and a high rating of the item ""concentrated"" and a low rating of the item ""fatigued."" This finding supports the hypothesis that the activation state associated with increased fronto-central theta activity accompanies efficient performance of demanding mental tasks. The usefulness of standardized laboratory tasks as monitoring instruments is demonstrated by the direct comparability with results of studies obtained from other relevant research applications using the same tasks. The feasibility of a self-administered integrated psychophysiological assessment of the individual state was illustrated by the nearly complete collection of data. The large number of individual data collected over the entire period permitted application of quantitative single-subject analysis, allowing reliable determination of changes in the individual state in the course of time. It thus appears that this assessment technique can be adapted for in-flight monitoring of astronauts during prolonged spaceflights. Parallel EEG recording can provide relevant supplementary information for diagnosing the individual activation state associated with task performance. The existence of large individual differences in the generation of task-sensitive EEG rhythms forms an important issue for further studies.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: After treatment for early glottic carcinoma, a considerable number of patients end up with voice problems that interfere with daily life activities. The objective of this randomized and controlled study was to assess the efficacy of voice therapy in these patients.METHODS: Of 177 patients, 6-120 months after treatment for early glottic carcinoma, 70 patients (40%) suffered from voice impairment based on a 5-item screening questionnaire. Approximately 60% of those 70 patients were not interested in participating in the current study. Twenty-three patients who were willing to participate were assigned randomly either to a voice therapy group (n = 12 patients) or to a control group (n = 11 patients). Multidimensional voice analyses (the self-reported Voice Handicap Index [VHI], acoustic and perceptual voice quality analysis, videolaryngostroboscopy, and the Voice Range Profile) were conducted twice: before and after voice therapy or with 3 months in between for the control group.RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the difference in scores (postmeasurement minus premeasurement) showed significant voice improvement after voice therapy on the total VHI score, percent jitter, and noise-to-harmonics ratio in the voice signal and on the perceptual rating of vocal fry.CONCLUSIONS: Voice therapy proved to be effective in patients who had voice problems after treatment for early glottic carcinoma.

We aimed to establish translatable mouse models of disseminated prostate cancer (PCa) to evaluate effectiveness of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 at various disease stages. <b>Methods</b>: C4-2, C4-2B, or 22Rv1 cells were injected into the left ventricle of male NSG mice. Disease progression was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). For treatment, mice were injected with 40 kBq <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 at one (early treatment cohort) or three weeks (late treatment cohort) post-inoculation. Treatment efficacy was monitored by BLI of whole-body tumor burden.

The disease burden in the early treatment cohort was stable over 27 weeks in 5/9 mice and progressive in 4/9 mice. These mice were sacrificed due to brain metastases. Median survival of the late treatment cohort was superior to controls (13 vs. 7 weeks; p<0.0001) but inferior to that in the early treatment cohort (13 vs. 27 weeks; p<0.001). Late cohort mice succumbed to extensive liver involvement.

836,"Performance of long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors. PURPOSE: High-sensitivity and high-resolution depth-encoding positron emission tomography (PET) detectors are required to simultaneously improve the sensitivity and spatial resolution of a PET scanner so that the quantitative accuracy of PET studies can be improved. The semi-monolithic scintillator PET detector has the advantage of measuring the depth of interaction with single-ended readout as compared to the traditional pixelated scintillator detector, and significantly reducing the edge effect that deteriorates the spatial resolution at edges of the detector as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector if a long rectangular semi-monolithic detector is used. In this work, depth-encoding PET detector modules were built by using long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillators and single-ended readout by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays. The performance of the detector modules was measured.METHODS: The rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator detector has an outside dimension of 11.6 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> and consists of 11 polished lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) slices measuring 1 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> . The enhanced specular reflector (ESR) was glued on both cross-sectional surfaces of each crystal slice. For the face opposite to the SiPM array and the two end faces of the detectors, surface treatments with and without black paint were implemented for performance comparison. The bottom face of the semi-monolithic detector was coupled to a 4 x 12 SiPM array that was grouped along rows and columns separately into 16 signals. The four row signals were used to identify the slices, and the 12 column signals were used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth direction) interaction positions. The detector was irradiated at multiple positions with a collimated 511 keV gamma beam. The collimated beam was obtained with electronic collimation by using a <sup>22</sup> Na point source and a reference detector. The estimated width of the gamma beam is around 0.5 mm. The flood histogram for crystal slices was measured by using the center of gravity (COG) method. The COG method and the squared COG method were used for y position estimation. The standard deviation of the column signals, the ratio of maximum to the sum of the column signals, and the sum of squared column signals were used for z position estimation.RESULTS: All slices were clearly resolved from the measured flood histograms for both detectors with different crystal surface treatments. The estimated y positions roughly linearly change with the true positions at the middle of the detector until ~5 mm from both ends of the detector. The y and z spatial resolutions of the detectors were estimated for all middle positions located more than 5 mm from both ends of the detector. The squared COG method provides better y position resolution than the COG method. The three z estimation methods provide similar depth of interaction (DOI) resolution. Surface treatment with black paint significantly improves both y and z position resolution but degrades the energy and timing resolution of the detectors. The average full width half maxima (FWHM) spatial resolution is improved from 1.77 to 1.07 mm in the y direction by using the squared COG method and from 2.71 to 1.55 mm in the z direction by using the standard deviation method. The slice-based average energy resolution degrades from 15.8% to 24.9%. The timing resolution of the entire detector module degrades from 596 to 788 ps.CONCLUSION: The performance of rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors with two different crystal surface treatments was measured. The detectors provide superior spatial resolution and depth-encoding capability and can be used to develop small animal and dedicated breast and brain PET scanners that can simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and low cost.",Excluded
1515,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant glioblastomas demonstrate a decreased rate of pseudoprogression: A multi-institutional experience. Background: Pseudoprogression (psPD) represents false radiologic evidence of tumor progression and is observed in some glioblastoma (GBM) patients after postoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with temozolomide (TMZ). The ambiguity of the psPD diagnosis confounds identification of true progression and may lead to unnecessary interventions. The association between psPD and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational (mut) status is understudied, and its incidence may alter clinical decision making. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 120 patients with IDH1-mut (n = 60) and IDH1-wild-type (IDH-WT; [n = 60]) GBMs who received postoperative CRT with TMZ at 4 academic institutions. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to identify psPD rates in routine brain MRIs performed up to 90 days after CRT completion. Result(s): Within 90 days of completing CRT, 9 GBM patients (1 [1.7%] IDH1-mut and 8 [13.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated true progression, whereas 17 patients (3 [5%] IDH1-muts and 14 [23.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated psPD (P =. 004). IDH1-mut GBMs had a lower probability of psPD (hazard ratio: 0.173, 95% CI, 0.047-0.638, P =. 008). Among the patients with radiologic signs suggestive of progression (n = 26), psPD was found to be the cause in 3 of 4 (75.0%) of the IDH1-mut GBMs and 14 of 22 (63.6%) of the IDH1-WT GBMs (P =. 496). Median overall survival for IDH1-mut and IDH1-WT GBM patients was 40.3 and 23.0 months, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion(s): IDH1-mut GBM patients demonstrate lower absolute rates of psPD expression. Irrespective of GBM subtype, psPD expression was more likely than true progression within 90 days of completing CRT. Continuing adjuvant treatment for IDH1-mut GBMs is suggested if radiologic progression is suspected during this time interval. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

3131,"Neoadjuvant versus definitive chemoradiation in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. BACKGROUND: Multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (nCRT + S) is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or node-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (E-SCC). Those who are unsuitable or who decline surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiation (dCRT). This study compares the oncologic outcome of nCRT + S and dCRT in E-SCC patients.METHODS: Between 2011 and 2017, 95 patients with E-SCC were scheduled for dCRT or nCRT+ S with IMRT at our department. Patients undergoing dCRT received at least 50 Gy and those undergoing nCRT + S received at least 41.4 Gy. All patients received simultaneous chemotherapy with either carboplatin and paclitaxel or cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. We retrospectively compared baseline characteristics and oncologic outcome including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and site of failure between both treatment groups.RESULTS: Patients undergoing dCRT were less likely to have clinically suspected lymph node metastases (85% vs. 100%, p = 0.019) than patients undergoing nCRT + S and had more proximally located tumors (median distance from dental arch to cranial tumor border 20 cm vs. 26 cm, p < 0.001). After a median follow up of 25.6 months for surviving patients, no significant differences for OS and PFS were noticed comparing nCRT + S and dCRT. However, the rate of local tumor recurrence was significantly higher in patients treated with dCRT than in those treated with nCRT + S (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.002). Within a multivariate Cox regression model, age, tumor location, and tumor grading were the only independent parameters affecting OS and PFS. In addition to that, proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently associated with an increased risk for local treatment failure.CONCLUSION: In E-SCC patients treated with either dCRT or nCRT + S, a higher rate of local tumor recurrence was seen in patients treated with dCRT than in patients treated with nCRT + S. There was at least a trend towards an improved OS and PFS in patients undergoing nCRT + S. However, this should be interpreted with caution, because proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently affecting the risk of local tumor recurrence.",Excluded

Nedaplatin is an analog of cisplatin that was developed in Japan, and it exhibits less nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin. This study aimed to determine the recommended dose of weekly nedaplatin chemoradiotherapy in high-risk patients following radical surgery. Fifteen patients who required postoperative pelvic radiotherapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer were enrolled in the present study. Nedaplatin was designed to be administered for eight cycles (minimum five cycles) beginning at a weekly dose of 22.5 mg/m(2) and then escalating to 25, 27.5, and then to 30 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy and/or planned chemotherapy (prior to the completion of five cycles) due to toxicity. Nedaplatin administration was interrupted prior to the completion of five cycles in one of six patients at a dose of 27.5 mg/m(2). A more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy did not occur in any patient. Nedaplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) was safely administered, and two of three patients could receive the planned chemotherapy consisting of eight cycles of weekly nedaplatin. Our recommended weekly nedaplatin dose was determined to be 30 mg/m(2) administered for more than five cycles and up to eight cycles if possible. Weekly administration of nedaplatin may be more tolerable and less toxic than weekly administration of cisplatin.",Excluded

1550,"Model-based calculation of thyroid gland normal tissue complication probability in head and neck cancer patients after radiation therapy. AIM: Primary hypothyroidism is one of the late complications that can occur after radiation therapy for malignant tumors in the head and neck region. The aim of this retrospective study was to show the validity of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication model for thyroid gland based on clinical results.METHODS: Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine serum levels before radiation therapy, 3 months after the beginning of radiation therapy, and afterwards at each follow-up visit. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Dose-volume histogram, total dose, fractionation schedule, total duration of the treatment, and other parameters were used for normal tissue complication probability calculation based on the LKB model. The model was evaluated after fitting with the three sets of parameters for grade 2 hypothyroidism: 1) ""Emami,"" where n= 0.22; m= 0.26, and D<sub>50</sub>= 80Gy; 2) ""mean dose,"" where n= 1; m= 0.27, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy; and 3) ""Lyman EUD,"" where n= 0.49; m= 0.24, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy. A value 3.0Gy was used for alpha/beta ratio RESULTS: Eighty-three patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy for head and neck cancers at the University Hospital Martin, Slovakia, from January 2014 to July 2017, were included in the retrospective study. Median follow-up was 1.2 years. Cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism grade 2 or higher after 12 and 24 months was 9.6 and 22.0%, respectively.

Because of the loss of hydrostatic pressure there is, during weightlessness, a fluid shift of extra- and intra-vascular volumes to the upper part of the body. This provokes objective and subjective symptoms, especially in the first days of spaceflight. The fluid shift is perceived by baroreceptors as a relative central hypervolaemia and induces neuro-hormonal mechanisms which provoke a real hypovolaemia. Cardiovascular deconditioning exists during spaceflight with the following symptoms when astronauts return to earth: decreased orthostatic tolerance with possible tendency towards spontaneous syncope and decreased effort capacity. The mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance are not well known.

1290,"In vivo protein secretion by lung. Evidence for active secretion and interspecies differences. The present study is an attempt to determine (a) if the lung actively secretes protein into the surface-active fraction of lung lavage returns; (b) if there are interspecies differences in this secretory activity; and (c) if the amount of nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction shows interspecies variation. I found that pilocarpine stimulates the release of radioactive protein into the lavage surface-active fraction of rabbits and that this pilocarpine effect is completely blocked by atropine. Inhibition of lung oxygen consumption by iodoacetate is associaged with a dose-dependent inhibition of the pilocarpine-induced secretion. Microtubules may be involved in this secretory process because colchicine inhibits the pilocarpine effect. Of the radioactive protein in the total surface-active fraction (tissue plus lavage returns), a greater percent appears in the lavage surface-active fraction at 2 and 4 h, after a pulsed injection [U-14C] leucine, in the mouse than in the rat, which in turn has a greater amount than the rabbit. There is also a difference in the amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction of different species: mouse greater than rabbit greater than cat greater than dog. The amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction is directly proportional to the species respiratory rate; the log of the nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction is inversely proportional to the log of the species alveolar diameter. I conclude that the lung actively secretes protein into the lavage surface-active fraction, that this secretion is under neurohumoral regulation, and that respiratory rate and alveolar size may influence this secretory activity and the amount of protein in this surface-active fraction.",Excluded

Clinical studies have revealed that up to 92% of major depressed patients report pain complaints such as back or abdominal pain. Furthermore, patients suffering from depression exhibit increased superficial pain thresholds and decreased ischemic (deep) pain thresholds during experimental pain testing in comparison to healthy controls. Here, we aimed to investigate a putative role of Adelta- and C-fibre activation in altered pain perception in the disease. Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) of 27 unmedicated depressed patients and 27 matched controls were recorded. Adelta and C fibres were activated separately. Amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 peaks of Adelta- (Adelta-LEP) and C-fibre- (C-LEP) related LEPs were evaluated. Depressed patients showed significantly decreased Adelta-LEP amplitudes (N2 peak: P=0.019; P2 peak: P=0.024) and delayed C-LEP latencies (P2 peak: P=0.0495; N2 peak: P=0.0556). In contrast, C-LEP amplitudes and Adelta-LEP latencies were unaffected. Our results might be suggestive of the differential impact of physiological changes on pain processing in depression. Thus, Adelta-LEP might reflect the physiological correlate of the augmented superficial pain thresholds during depression. On the contrary, the C-fibre component mediates the facets of pain processing, outlasting the stimulation period, and has been shown to be exaggerated in chronic pain states. Therefore, the functional over-representation of the C-fibre component found in our study might be a possible link between depression and associated pain complaints.",Excluded
2820,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-beta2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts.",Excluded

Clinical case:A 66-year-old man with a history of Cushing's syndrome was treated with subtotal adrenalectomy and external pituitary irradiation in 1964. In 2004 he was diagnosed with Nelson's syndrome. MRI demonstrated 1 x 2 cm pituitary macroadenoma invading the right cavernous sinus and suprasellar cistern. The patient underwent transsphenoidal resection (TSSR) of the tumor in 2005. However, ACTH level increased to 8,310 pg/mL within a year. At the same time, right-sided ptosis and diplopia developed. MRI revealed further enlargement of the adenoma. The patient underwent craniotomy in 2006 and most of the tumor was removed except for a small residual portion invading the wall of the carotid artery. Although ACTH reached a nadir of 1,543 pg/mL postoperatively, it rebounded to 14,652 pg/mL in nine months. Another MRI revealed recurrent pituitary macroadenoma and in 2008 the patient again underwent TSSR of the tumor followed by radiation. Treatment with cabergoline and octreotide was initiated but the response was only transient as both ACTH and residual tumor increased. In November of 2012, patient presented to the emergency room with severe headache and palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. A MRI revealed 3.2 cm pituitary adenoma with suprasellar extension and encasement of the right internal carotid artery, but no hemorrhage, midline shift, or mass effect was noted. One week after hospitalization, serum ACTH declined to 2183 pg/mL and headaches completely resolved. Clinical diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy was established. Discussion(s): Pituitary apoplexy is a known complication of Nelson's Syndrome. Previous literature has described increased frequency of apoplexy in the setting of Nelson's syndrome when compared to pituitary adenomas in general (1). Although apoplexy is commonly accompanied by evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis on imaging, it is not required for the diagnosis (2). Conclusion(s): We present a case of pituitary apoplexy in a patient with Nelson's syndrome resistant to surgical, medical and radiation therapy. Apoplexy was confirmed clinically and biochemically, without evidence of hemorrhage on imaging. This case illustrates the clinical course and complications of Nelson's syndrome.",Excluded
1397,"Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Pain flare occurs after palliative radiotherapy, and dexamethasone has shown potential for prevention of such flare. We aimed to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of placebo in terms of reduction of incidence of pain flare.METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients from 23 Canadian centres were randomly allocated (1:1) with a web-based system and minimisation algorithm to receive either two 4 mg dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets taken orally at least 1 h before the start of radiation treatment (a single 8 Gy dose to bone metastases; day 0) and then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy (days 1-4). Patients were eligible if they had a non-haematological malignancy and bone metastasis (or metastases) corresponding to the clinically painful area or areas. Patients reported their worst pain scores and opioid analgesic intake before treatment and daily for 10 days after radiation treatment. They completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life QLQ-C15-PAL, the bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22), and the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire at baseline, and at days 10 and 42 after radiation treatment. Pain flare was defined as at least a two-point increase on a scale of 0-10 in the worst pain score with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% or greater increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in the worst pain score from days 0-10, followed by a return to baseline levels or below. Primary analysis of incidence of pain flare was by intention-to-treat (patients with missing primary data were classified as having pain flare). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248585, and is completed.FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2011, and Dec 11, 2014, 298 patients were enrolled. 39 (26%) of 148 patients randomly allocated to the dexamethasone group and 53 (35%) of 150 patients in the placebo group had a pain flare (difference 8.9%, lower 95% confidence bound 0.0, one-sided p=0.05). Two grade 3 and one grade 4 biochemical hyperglycaemic events occurred in the dexamethasone group (without known clinical effects) compared with none in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were bone pain (61 [41%] of 147 vs 68 [48%] of 143), fatigue (58 [39%] of 147 vs 49 [34%] of 143), constipation (47 [32%] of 147 vs 37 [26%] of 143), and nausea (34 [23%] of 147 vs 34 [24%] of 143), most of which were mild grade 1 or 2.INTERPRETATION: Dexamethasone reduces radiation-induced pain flare in the treatment of painful bone metastases.FUNDING: The NCIC CTG's programmatic grant from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute.",Excluded
1596,"Improved synthesis of SV2A targeting radiotracer [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J. Introduction: [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J is a tracer developed for PET (positron emission tomography) that has high affinity towards synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein believed to participate in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in neurons and endocrine cells. The localisation of SV2A in the synaptic terminals makes it a viable target for in vivo imaging of synaptic density in the brain. Several SV2A targeting compounds have been evaluated as PET tracers, including [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, with the aim to facilitate studies of synaptic density in neurological diseases. The original two-step synthesis method failed in our hands to produce sufficient amounts of [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, but served as an excellent starting point for further optimizations towards a high yielding and simplified one-step method. [<sup>11</sup>C]Methyl iodide was trapped in a clear THF-water solution containing the trifluoroborate substituted precursor, potassium carbonate and palladium complex. The resulting reaction mixture was heated at 70 degreeC for 4 min to produce [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J. Result(s): After semi-preparative HPLC purification and reformulation in 10% ethanol/phosphate buffered saline, the product was obtained in 39 +/- 5% radiochemical yield based on [<sup>11</sup>C]methyl iodide, corresponding to 1.8 +/- 0.5 GBq at EOS. The radiochemical purity was > 99% and the molar activity was 390 +/- 180 GBq/mumol at EOS. The product solution contained < 2 ppb palladium. Conclusion(s): A robust and high yielding production method has been developed for [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, suitable for both preclinical and clinical PET applications.

2917,"Electric field stimulation of precision-cut lung slices. The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) technique is widely used to examine airway responses in different species. We developed a method to study nerve-dependent bronchoconstriction by the application of electric field stimulation (EFS) to PCLS. PCLS prepared from Wistar rats were placed between two platinum electrodes to apply serial rectangular impulses (5-100 Hz), and bronchoconstriction was studied by videomicroscopy. The extent of airway contractions increased with higher frequencies. Stable repeated airway contractions were obtained at a frequency of 50 Hz, a width of 1 ms, and an output of 200 mA for 2.5 s each minute. Larger airways showed stronger responses. The EFS-triggered contractions were increased by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine (10 muM) and reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 muM), whereas the thromboxane protanoid receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 muM) had no effect. Magnesium ions (10 mM) antagonized airway contractions induced by EFS, but not by methacholine, indicating that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS. Our data further show that the electrically evoked airway contractions in PCLS are mediated by cholinergic nerves, independent of thromboxane and more prominent in larger airways. Taken together these findings show that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS, and they suggest that the present method is useful to study neurogenic responses in airways of different size.

491,"Study of dosimetric indices and dose constraints to critical organs for head and neck tumours treated with inverse planned simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Aim This study aimed to investigate tolerance dose to organs at risk (OARs) as well as degree of conformity and homogeneity for head and neck cancer patients by using simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique (SIB IMRT).Materials and methods This study analysed 15 head and neck cancer patients receiving treatment using inverse planned SIB IMRT technique. Using a beam energy of 6 MV, two dose levels of 70 and 55.4 Gy were used to treat the tumour. Doses of 2 Gy in 35 fractions and 1.68 Gy in 33 fractions were simultaneously delivered for effective planning target volume (PTV1) and boost planning target volume (PTV2), respectively.Results Dose distribution in PTV and critical organs lies within tolerance dose guidelines protecting spinal cord, brain stem, optic chiasm, optic nerve, thus reducing the risk of damage to normal tissues. Minor deviation from tolerance limit was observed for parotid glands. This technique provided highly conformal and homogenous dose distribution as well as better sparing of OARs, hence verifying quality assurance results to be satisfactory.Findings SIB IMRT technique offers best solution for preserving organ function by keeping dose below tolerance level. Treatment of head and neck carcinoma using SIB IMRT is feasible, more efficient, and dose escalation is achieved in a single plan. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2017.",Excluded
2257,"A prospective study of thyroid function after radiotherapy for central nervous system and head and neck malignancies. Purpose/Objective: Few studies evaluate endocrine gland function following radiotherapy (RT). We conducted a single-institution prospective study to understand the effect of RT on pituitary and thyroid function in adults. Material(s) and Method(s): Adult patients who received fractionated RT for non-metastatic head and neck cancer and benign intracranial neoplasms were eligible. Patients with a history of thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamic surgery or baseline hormonal supplementation were excluded. Baseline endocrine labs were obtained prior to RT and at 6- month intervals for 5 years. A dose-volume histogram report was generated for the hypothalamus, thyroid, and pituitary gland. Hypothyroidism (HT) was defined as TSH level > 5.0 mIU/L or T4 < 0.8 ng/dL. The primary endpoint was to establish the incidence and threshold dose for RT-related endocrine dysfunction. This interim analysis reports on thyroid function for the first 50 of a planned 200 patients enrolled. Result(s): From October 2006 to May 2008, 50 patients were enrolled with a median follow up of 67 months (range, 17-82 months). Forty-two patients were treated for head and neck (HN) cancers, and eight were treated for benign central nervous (CNS) tumors. No patient was on thyroid supplementation at baseline. The median prescription dose was 6000 cGy in 30 fractions (range, 4500-7000 cGy). Thirty-six patients (72%) were treated adjuvantly and 31 patients (62%) also received concurrent chemotherapy. Primary HT incidence was 60% (n=30) at a median of 12 months (range, 2.9-58.7). The 12-, 24-, 48-, and 60-month freedom from thyroid dysfunction was 78%, 52%, 47.5%, and 33.7%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (42%) received thyroid replacement therapy with a median time to therapy of 3.5 months after diagnosis of HT. The mean thyroid dose in patients with HT was 6136 cGy (range, 3958-6930) compared to 2825 cGy (range, 0-7032) for those without HT. The incidence of HT was 11% (n=2) vs. 87.5% (n=28) for patients with a mean thyroid dose below vs. above 5000 cGy, respectively (p<0.0001). No secondary HT was observed, and the mean pituitary dose for patients with HT was 1065 cGy. Significant risk factors for HT identified on univariate analysis included mean thyroid dose above 5000 cGy <0.0001), concurrent chemotherapy (p=0.029), and HN vs. CNS radiation (p=0.004). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that patients who receive a mean thyroid dose > 5000 cGy are at increased risk for primary HT after RT. Median time to HT is 12 months, but can occur as early as 3 months post- RT. Routine regular laboratory assessment with prompt appropriate thyroid supplementation is recommended.",Excluded
642,"Target size analysis of opioid receptors. No difference between receptor types, but discrimination between two receptor states. Target size analysis of opioid receptor is complicated by the presence of multi-exponential inactivation curves. Irradiation of intact frozen tissue proved essential to eliminate such artifacts, due to indirect irradiation effects. Upon irradiation condition, opioid binding activity was inactivated in a single mono-exponential manner. Identical inactivation curves were obtained for mu, delta and kappa binding activities in brain membranes from rat, guinea-pig and frog and in NG 108-15 cells: the molecular mass obtained was 98 +/- 2 kDa. However, when opioid binding was assayed in the presence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP, the molecular mass was found to be only 56 +/- 4.4 kDa. We suggest that the opioid recognition site comprises a unit of 56 kDa and that in the absence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP an additional membrane component of 40-44 kDa is necessary for high-affinity opioid binding.",Excluded
826,"Radiation dose analysis of large and giant internal carotid artery aneurysm treatment with the pipeline embolization device versus traditional coiling techniques. BACKGROUND: Flow diversion is an effective and increasingly accepted method for endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Additionally, the public has heightened concerns regarding radiation exposure from medical procedures. This study analyzes radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during treatment of large and giant proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with the pipeline embolization device (PED) versus traditional coiling techniques.METHODS: Radiation dose, fluoroscopy time, and contrast dye administration were retrospectively analyzed in 55 patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aneurysms >= 10 mm from petrous to superior hypophyseal ICA segments. Patients were treated by either PED (37 patients) or traditional coiling techniques (18 patients). Aortic arch type and proximal ICA tortuosity were also assessed as markers of access difficulty.RESULTS: Average radiation dose with PED treatment was 2840 +/- 213 mGy and 4010 +/- 708 mGy with traditional coiling techniques (p=0.048; 29% decrease with PED). Mean fluoroscopy time for PED was 56.1 +/- 5.0 min and 85.9 +/- 11.9 min for coiling cases (p=0.0087; 35% decrease with PED). These benefits existed despite more difficult arch anatomy and a trend towards greater proximal vessel tortuosity in PED cases. Contrast dye amounts were also reduced by 37.5% in PED cases (75 +/- 6 mL) versus coiling cases (120 +/- 13 mL, p=0.0008).CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of large and giant proximal ICA aneurysms using PED requires less radiation, less fluoroscopy time, and less contrast administration than standard coiling techniques. This further demonstrates the benefits of flow diversion for treatment of these aneurysms.",Excluded
785,"Clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography in the diagnosis of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. INTRODUCTION: CT-angiography gains an increasing role in the initial diagnosis of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the implementation of CT-angiography does not always exclude the necessity of conventional angiography. Our objective was to determine the practical utility and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography.METHODS: All patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to our university hospital after implementation of CT-angiography between June 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in regard to factors of treatment flow, radiation exposure, harms of contrast medium loading, and diagnostic costs. A control group of the same size was assembled from previously admitted SAH patients, who did not undergo pretreatment CT-angiography. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.RESULTS: The final analysis consisted of 93 patients in each group. Of 93 patients with pretreatment CT-angiography, 74 had to undergo conventional angiography for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. CT-angiography had significant impact on the reduction of collective effective radiation dose by 4.419 mSv per person (p = 0.0002) and was not associated with additional harms. Despite the significantly earlier detection of aneurysms with CT-angiography (p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in the timing of aneurysm repair and duration of ICU and general hospital stay. There was an increase of diagnostic costs-the cost-effectiveness analysis showed, however, that benefits of CT-angiography in respect to radiation exposure and risk of conventional angiography-related complications justify the additional costs of CT-angiography.CONCLUSIONS: Although the implementation of CT-angiography in SAH diagnosis cannot completely replace conventional angiography, it can be approved in regard to radiation hygiene and cost-effectiveness.",Excluded

998,"Extreme retinal remodeling triggered by light damage: implications for age related macular degeneration. PURPOSE: Our objective was to comprehensively assess the nature and chronology of neural remodeling in retinal degenerations triggered by light-induced retinal damage (LIRD) in adult albino rodents. Our primary hypothesis is that all complete photoreceptor degenerations devolve to extensive remodeling. An hypothesis emergent from data analysis is that the LIRD model closely mimics late-stage atrophic age relared macular degeneration (AMD).METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received intense light exposures of varied durations and survival times ranging from 0 to 240 days. Remodeling was visualized by computational molecular phenotyping (CMP) of a small molecule library: 4-aminobutyrate (gamma), arginine (R), aspartate (D), glutamate (E), glutamine (Q), glutathione (J), glycine (G), and taurine (tau). This library was augmented by probes for key proteins such as rod opsin, cone opsin and cellular retinal binding protein (CRALBP). Quantitative CMP was used to profile 160 eyes from 86 animals in over 6,000 sections.RESULTS: The onset of remodeling in LIRD retinas is rapid, with immediate signs of metabolic stress in photoreceptors, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the choriocapillaris, and Muller cells. In particular, anomalous elevated aspartate levels appear to be an early stress marker in photoreceptors. After the stress phase, LIRD progresses to focal photoreceptor degeneration within 14 days and extensive remodeling by 60 days. RPE and choriocapillaris losses parallel Muller cell distal seal formation, with progressive neuronal migration, microneuroma evolution, fluid channel formation, and slow neuronal death. The remaining retina in advanced light damage can be classified as survivor, light damage (LD), or decimated zones where massive Muller cell and neuronal emigration into the choroid leaves a retina depleted of neurons and Muller cells. These zones and their transitions closely resemble human geographic atrophy. Across these zones, Muller cells manifest extreme changes in the definitive Muller cell tauQE signature, as well as CRALBP and arginine signals.CONCLUSIONS: LIRD retinas manifest remodeling patterns of genetic retinal degeneration models, but involve no developmental complexities, and are ultimately more aggressive, devastating the remaining neural retina. The decimation of the neural retina via cell emigration through the perforated retina-choroid interface is a serious denouement. If focal remodeling in LIRD accurately profiles late stage atrophic age-related macular degenerations, it augurs poorly for simple molecular interventions. Indeed, the LIRD profile in the SD rat manifests more similarities to advanced human atrophic AMD than most genetically or immunologically induced murine models of AMD.",Excluded
