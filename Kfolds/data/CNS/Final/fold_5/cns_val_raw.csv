3230,"Stereotactic radiosurgery in recurrent high grade malignant glioma of the brain. [Spanish]. Purpose: To evaluate in a phase II trial the local control and survival of patients with recurrent high grade brain glioma treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Material(s) and Method(s): Fourteen patients, 7 with glioblastoma multiforme and 7 with anaplastic astrocytoma, with a mean tumor volume of 26.5 cc, received SRS employing an average single total dose of 22 Gy (range 11-40 Gy). Result(s): The mean survival time was 14 months, and the 1 and 2 year aditional survival was of 73.8% and 42.2% respectively. Eleven patients (79%) had a local tumor progression, with a progression mean time of 11 months. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a tolerable alternative treatment modality in patients with recurrent high grade malignant glioma.",Excluded
1207,"Light and vision in the deep-sea benthos: II. Vision in deep-sea crustaceans. Using new collecting techniques with the Johnson-Sea-Link submersible, eight species of deep-sea benthic crustaceans were collected with intact visual systems. Their spectral sensitivities and temporal resolutions were determined shipboard using electroretinography. Useable spectral sensitivity data were obtained from seven species, and in the dark-adapted eyes, the spectral sensitivity peaks were in the blue region of the visible spectrum, ranging from 470 to 497 nm. Under blue chromatic adaptation, a secondary sensitivity peak in the UV portion of the spectrum appeared for two species of anomuran crabs: Eumunida picta (lambda(max)363 nm) and Gastroptychus spinifer (lambda(max)383 nm). Wavelength-specific differences in response waveforms under blue chromatic adaptation in these two species suggest that two populations of photoreceptor cells are present. Temporal resolution was determined in all eight species using the maximum critical flicker frequency (CFF(max)). The CFF(max) for the isopod Booralana tricarinata of 4 Hz proved to be the lowest ever measured using this technique, and suggests that this species is not able to track even slow-moving prey. Both the putative dual visual pigment system in the crabs and the extremely slow eye of the isopod may be adaptations for seeing bioluminescence in the benthic environment.",Excluded
1787,"[Effect of proton irradiation of the hypophysis on its gonadotropic and thyrotropic functions in patients with prolactinoma]. In order to study the effect of proton beam irradiation on prolactinoma cells and hypophyseal intact cells tests with i.v. administration of TRH (200 micrograms) and LH-RH (100 micrograms) were performed in 16 women with prolactin-secreting adenomas before and in 2 mos.-2 years after irradiation of the pituitary body with a high energy narrow proton beam (1000 MeV) at a dose of 40-120 Gy. A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells. The results suggest refractivity of adenomatous lactotrophs to radiation exposure and the hypothalamic level of disorder of ovarian function regulation in this pathology.",Excluded
1865,"Structural Basis of the Molecular Switch between Phosphatase and Mutase Functions of Human Phosphomannomutase 1 under Ischemic Conditions. The human phosphomannomutases PMM1 and PMM2 catalyze the interconversion of hexose 6-phosphates and hexose 1-phosphates. The two isoforms share 66% sequence identity and have kinetic properties similar to those of mutases in vitro but differ in their functional roles in vivo. Though the physiological role of PMM2 is catalysis of the mutase reaction that provides the mannose 1-phosphate (Man-1-P) essential for protein glycosylation, PMM1 is thought to provide a phosphohydrolase activity in the presence of inosine monophosphate (IMP), converting glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glu-1,6-P<inf>2</inf>) to glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P), rescuing glycolysis during brain ischemia. To uncover the structural basis of how IMP binding converts PMM1 from a mutase to a phosphatase, the 1.93 A resolution structure of PMM1 complexed with IMP was determined. The structure reveals IMP bound at the substrate recruitment site, thus inhibiting the mutase activity while simultaneously activating a phosphatase activity (IMP K<inf>act</inf> = 1.5 muM) resulting from the hydrolysis of the phospho-enzyme. The bound structure and site-directed mutagenesis confirm that the long-range electrostatic interactions provided by Arg180 and Arg183 conserved in PMM1 are the major contributors to IMP binding, and their oblation removes phosphatase but not mutase activity. These residues are not present in the PMM2 isoform, which consequently lacks significant phosphatase activity in the presence of IMP. T<inf>2</inf> relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance and small angle X-ray scattering together support the hypothesis that binding of IMP to PMM1 favors an enzyme conformation that is catalytically competent for water attack at the phosphoaspartyl intermediate. Such a mechanism may be generalizable to other enzymes that act through covalent intermediates. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",Excluded
1755,"Gamma frequency entrainment attenuates amyloid load and modifies microglia. Changes in gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz) have been observed in several neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta)<sub>1-40</sub> and Abeta <sub>1-42</sub> isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Abeta. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Abeta<sub>1-40</sub> and Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.",Excluded
991,"FTIR spectroscopy studies of nucleic acid damage. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of RNA isolated from tumour brain (glioma) and DNA isolated from low-dose gamma-irradiated epididymis cells of rats from the Chernobyl accident zone have been investigated in the 700-4000 cm(-1) region. The total absorbed radiation doses were equal to or less than 57 cGy. Observed changes in the FTIR spectra represent the damage in the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of nucleic acid, which seem to be connected with modification of bases and sugars, and redistribution of the H-bond network. FTIR data for tumour and gamma-irradiated nucleic acid show some similar features. A great amount of statistical data and good mathematical approaches are needed for the use of these data as diagnostic criteria.",Included
1509,"Development of a method for measuring femoral torsion using real-time ultrasound. Excessive femoral torsion has been associated with various musculoskeletal and neurological problems. To explore this relationship, it is essential to be able to measure femoral torsion in the clinic accurately. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are thought to provide the most accurate measurements but CT involves significant radiation exposure and MRI is expensive. The aim of this study was to design a method for measuring femoral torsion in the clinic, and to determine the reliability of this method. Details of design process, including construction of a jig, the protocol developed and the reliability of the method are presented. The protocol developed used ultrasound to image a ridge on the greater trochanter, and a customized jig placed on the femoral condyles as reference points. An inclinometer attached to the customized jig allowed quantification of the degree of femoral torsion. Measurements taken with this protocol had excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1 = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively). This method of measuring femoral torsion also permitted measurement of femoral torsion with a high degree of accuracy. This method is applicable to the research setting and, with minor adjustments, will be applicable to the clinical setting.",Excluded

2520,"Preconditioning with bright light evokes a protective response against light damage in the rat retina. Constant exposure to bright light induces photoreceptor degeneration and at the same time upregulates the expression of several neurotrophic factors in the retina. At issue is whether the induced neurotrophic factors protect photoreceptors. We used a preconditioning paradigm to show that animals preconditioned with bright light became resistant to subsequent light damage. The preconditioning consisted of a 12-48 hr preexposure, followed by a 48 hr ""rest phase"" of normal cyclic lighting. The greatest protection was achieved by a 12 hr preexposure. Preconditioning induces a prolonged increase in two endogenous neurotrophic factors: basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). It also stimulates the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Erks) in both photoreceptors and Muller cells. These findings indicate that exposure to bright light initiates two opposing processes: a fast degenerative process that kills photoreceptors and a relatively slower process that leads to the protection of photoreceptors. The extent of light damage, therefore, depends on the interaction of the two processes. These results also suggest a role of endogenous bFGF and CNTF in photoreceptor protection and the importance of Erk activation in photoreceptor survival.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: The RTOG 9402 trial reported an improved Outcome in IDH mutant and 1p19q-codeleted anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors after chemotherapy (CT) with radiotherapy (RT). We evaluated the efficacy of CT and RT in patients with IDH mutant, 1p19q-noncodeleted secondary high-grade astrocytoma (sHGA) WHO grades III and IV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment data from 109 patients with sHGA grades III and IV, developed from histologically confirmed low-grade astrocytoma grade II were retrospectively analyzed. IDH mutation-, 1p19q/codeletion- and MGMT-promoter methylation status were evaluable in all patients. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in relation to adjuvant treatment modalities and molecular profiling were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULT(S): Out of 109 patients, 88 patients (80.7%) harbored an IDH1 or 2 mutations, 30 patients a 1p19q-codeletion (27.5%), and 63 patients (57.8%) exhibited a methylated MGMT-promoter status. During the follow-up time 57 patients (52.2%) died. The postsurgical treatment for the 88 IDH mutant sHGA included: RT alone in 17 patients (19.3%), a combined RT and CT (RCT) in 48 patients (54.5%) and CT alone in 20 patients (22.7%). 3 patients did not receive any adjuvant treatment due to bad neurological conditions. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, the median OS of all IDH mutant sHGA was 5.67 years (1.9-17.4 years). The OS in patients who received RCT was 6.4 years, which is significantly longer compared with those who underwent RT alone (1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.51. p = 0.011). After including only IDH mutant sHGA patients without a 1p19q-codeletion, the Kaplan-Meier curves estimates a significantly improved OS in the RCT cohort (33 patients) in comparison to patients who received RT alone (10 patients) (6.4 vs 1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.34-0.6, p= 0.022).

1974,"Unification of extreme levels of exposure to flight factors of different energy nature. [Russian]. The factors of a various energetic nature the extreme levels of which both directly (via special receptors) and mediately influence and change the functions of nervous system are studied. Empirical data suggest conclusively that the general biological regularities of the effects of an ""intensity-time"" type is also valid on the organism level if the central nervous system is thought of as an irritable object. In all cases the initial cause of the disturbed cerebral activity is an external energetic irritative action. It is demonstrated that the character of human response to the extreme effects of some flight factors corresponds to general biological regularity of the reaction toward irritating stimulus. In this case the general mechanism of such reactions of the nervous system is an exhaustion of the energetic brain resources. There have been derived the equalities which define the quantitative relationships among the equivalent levels of extreme flight factor effects and the common unit of their measurement is introduced. On the basis of general biological regularities of the body response to irritating stimulus, the method for estimating and predicting useful consciousness time of the pilot in case of a combined effect of the flight factors under extreme conditions is suggested. For some flight factors (altitude, flight accelerations, noise, ionizing radiation) there have been obtained the qualitative indices enabling one to apply this method to solve the practical tasks. The set algorithm can be fed in personal computers and extended to other flight factors.",Excluded
1736,"A phase I dose escalation study of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy as salvage therapy for persistent or recurrent malignant glioma. Purpose: A phase I dose escalation of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (H-SRT) in recurrent or persistent malignant gliomas as a means of increasing the biologically effective dose and decreasing the high rate of reoperation due to toxicity associated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): From November 1994 to September 1996, 25 lesions in 20 patients with clinical and/or imaging evidence of malignant glioma persistence or recurrence received salvage H-SRT, Nineteen patients at the time of initial diagnosis had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and one patient had an anaplastic astrocytoma. All of these patients with tumor persistence or recurrence had received initial fractionated radiation therapy (RT) with a mean and median dose of 60 Gy (44.0-72.0 Gy). The median time from completion of initial RT to H-SRT was 3.1 months (0.7-45.5 months). Salvage H-SRT was delivered using daily 3.0- 3.5 Gy fractions (fxs). Three different total dose levels were sequentially evaluated: 24.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (five lesions), 30.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (10 lesions), and 35.0 Gy/3.5 Gy fxs (nine lesions). Median treated tumor volume measured 12.66 cc (0.89-47.5 cc). The median ratio of prescription volume to tumor volume was 2,8 (1.4-5.0). Toxicity was judged by RTOG criteria. Response was determined by clinical neurologic improvement, a decrease in steroid dose without clinical deterioration, and/or radiologic imaging. Result(s): No grade 3 toxicities were observed and no reoperation due to toxicity was required. At the time of analysis, 13 of 20 patients had died. The median survival time from the completion of H-SRT is 10.5 months with a 1-year survival rate of 20%. Neurological improvement was found in 45% of patients. Decreased steroid requirements occurred in 60% of patients. Minor imaging response was noted in 22% of patients. Using Fisher's exact test, response of any kind correlated strongly to total dose (p = 0.0056). None of six lesions treated with 21 Gy or 24 Gy responded, whereas there was a 79% response rate among the 19 lesions treated with 30 or 35 Gy. Tumor volumes <=20 cc were associated with a higher likelihood of response (p = 0.053). Conclusion(s): H-SRT used in this cohort of previously irradiated patients with malignant glioma was not associated with the need for reoperation due to toxicity or grade 3 toxicity. This low toxicity profile and encouraging H- SRT dose-related response outcome justifies further evaluation and dose escalation.",Excluded
3275,"Regulation of the IRF-1 tumour modifier during the response to genotoxic stress involves an ATM-dependent signalling pathway. The mechanism by which genotoxic stress induces IRF-1 and the signalling components upstream of this anti-oncogenic transcription factor during the response to DNA damage are not known. We demonstrate that IRF-1 and the tumour suppressor protein p53 are coordinately up-regulated during the response to DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner. Induction of IRF-1 protein by either ionizing radiation (IR) or etoposide occurs through a concerted mechanism involving increased IRF-1 expression/synthesis and an increase in the half-life of the IRF-1 protein. A striking defect in the induction of both IRF-1 mRNA and IRF-1 protein was observed in ATM deficient cells. Although ATM deficient cells failed to increase IRF-1 in response to genotoxic stress, the induction of IRF-1 in response to viral mimetics remained intact. Re-expression of the ATM kinase in AT cells restored the DNA damage inducibility of IRF-1, whilst the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited IRF-1 induction by DNA damage in ATM-positive cells. The data highlight a role for the ATM kinase in orchestrating the coordinated induction and transcriptional cooperation of IRF-1 and p53 to regulate p21 expression. Thus, IRF-1 is controlled by two distinct signalling pathways; a JAK/STAT-signalling pathway in viral infected cells and an ATM-signalling pathway in DNA damaged cells.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Various methods have been used to obtain a topographic map of bleached photopigments in human retinas in the past. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the bleaching topography of the photoreceptors could be obtained by snapshot imaging reflectometry.METHODS: Four to five fundus photographs of one rhesus monkey and three healthy human subjects were taken by white flashes at intervals of 4 s, with a commercial fundus camera with minimal modifications. The flash-induced reflectance increases (bleaching) were calculated by dividing the reflectance of the first image into the subsequent images, pixel by pixel.RESULTS: The topography of the bleached macula corresponded well with the anatomical distribution of the cones. The ratio of reflectance changes in the center to that in the surrounding tissue was high for red and low for green and blue images. These results indicate that the reflectivity changes were not artifacts but were derived from changes in the photopigment density in the cones and rods.CONCLUSIONS: The topography of bleached photoreceptors obtained with a commercial fundus camera from one monkey and three healthy human subjects showed that this technique has potential as a new clinical method for examining photoreceptor function in both normal and diseased retinas.",Excluded
3897,"Concurrent temozolomide and radiation in elderly patients with glioblastoma: A retrospective analysis. Purpose/Objective(s): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide is well tolerated and significantly improves survival. In studying this treatment approach, patients >=70 years of age have rarely been included. Here we examine the potential benefit of concurrent temozolomide in patients >=70. Materials/Methods: Retrospective chart review of patient records treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2010, with radiation (XRT) for GBM with or without temozolomide. Analysis was limited to patients >= 70 years of age with GBM, who received XRT at MDACC, had no previous chemotherapy or XRT for their diagnosis, and had no prior grade 1-3 glioma diagnosis. Of 170 patients >=70 years old at the time of histopathologic diagnosis of GBM by either biopsy or resection, 51 met these criteria, (median age 75, range 70- 87). Extent of tumor resection was evaluated by surgical reports and immediate postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between initial GBM diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated as interval between diagnosis and documented progression or death. Overall median follow up was 7 months (0-43), with median of 4 months (0-31) in the XRT only group, and 10 months (1-43) in the XRT + temozolomide group. Survival differences were calculated via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank statistics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox-regression analysis. This study was reviewed and approved by the MDACC Internal Review Board. Result(s): On univariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with overall survival: Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<80 vs >= 80 p = 0.039), radiation dose (<= 50 Gy vs > 50 Gy, p = 0.013), concurrent temozolomide (p = 0.006) and extent of surgery (biopsy vs subtotal resection vs gross total resection, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, extent of surgery, concurrent temozolamide and XRT dose were associated with improved OS (p=0.003). Median OS for the population was 8 months (<1-43). OS in those patients treated with XRT alone was 5 months vs 11 months in those patients receiving XRT and temozolomide (p =0.004). Median progression free survival was 5 months (<1-28) with no significant difference (p =0.164) between treatment groups. Conclusion(s):With short follow up, temozolomide in addition to radiation therapy is associated with improved overall survival in patients withGBM>=70 years. This prompts further prospective study to evaluate the effects of age, health status and fractionation on survival and quality of life in the elderly patient with GBM.",Excluded
2585,"Lipid peroxidation of liposomes with different ratios of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. [Chinese]. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different ratios of phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol (PC/CHOL) in liposomes on lipid peroxidation. The liposomes were prepared by ultrasonication using egg yolk lecithin alone (PC, control) or with different contents of cholesterol in molar ratios of 1:0.125, 1:0.25, and 1:0.5.

Lipid peroxidation of the liposomes increased with increasing incubation time, irrespective of whether or not they contained cholesterol. In addition, results from the CD and FOX assays markedly increased after 2 h of incubation, while TBARS increased after 4 h of incubation. In the initial 8-h incubation, CD, FOX, and TBARS in PC/CHOL (1: 0.5) gradually decreased with increasing cholesterol contents of liposomes but were significantly higher after 24 h of incubation when compared to the control group. However, the cholesterol content of liposomes did not affect the fatty acid composition after 24 h of incubation.

424,"A common sense approach to radiotherapy planning of glioblastoma multiforme situated in the temporal lobe. PURPOSE: Irradiation remains the cornerstone of management for glioblastoma multiforme. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer advocate encompassing the primary tumor plus a 2-cm margin in the high-dose volume. One shortcoming of this approach is the exposure of critical structures to radiation doses that could exceed organ tolerance. We investigated whether the temporal bone (rather than the aforementioned 2-cm radius) would serve as a barrier to tumor spread when regarded as the anterior margin for temporal lobe lesions. We hypothesized that by using the temporal bone as the radiation field margin, toxicity could be reduced without compromising tumor control.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2003 and 2007, 342 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme were treated with surgery and primary irradiation at our institution. Of these 342 patients, 50 had lesions confined to the temporal lobe. The clinical target volume included the primary lesion, the area of edema when present, and a 2-cm margin, except in the direction of the temporal bone.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 40 were available for evaluation. At a median follow-up of 12.95 months, 8 patients had not yet shown signs of tumor progression, 24 had local failure, 7 had distant or mixed (local plus distant) failure, and only 1 patient had failure in the infratemporal fossa.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study have demonstrated an acceptable level of recurrence when the temporal bone, rather than a 2-cm margin, is used as the anterior border of the clinical target volume. The strategy we have proposed achieves tumor control and respects optic tolerance without resorting to complex, expensive approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy.",Excluded

Primary explanatory variables were peritumoural and/or tumoural glutamate concentrations, glutamate transporter expression (EAAT2 and SXC). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis was performed with primary outcomes of time to first post-operative seizure and overall survival. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with de novo glioblastomas who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 47 (21.8 %), 34 (15.8 %) and 135 (62.5 %) WHO grade II, III and IV gliomas respectively were followed for a median of 15.8 months. Following multivariate analysis, there was a non-significant association between higher peritumoural glutamate concentrations and time to first post-operative seizure (HR 2.07, CI 0.98-4.37, p = 0.06). In subgroup analysis of 81 glioblastoma patients who received adjunct chemoradiotherapy, peritumoural glutamate concentration was significantly associated with time to first post-operative seizure (HR 3.10, CI 1.20-7.97, p = 0.02). In both the overall cohort and subgroup analysis no glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. Increased concentrations of peritumoural glutamate were significantly associated with shorter periods of post-operative seizure freedom in patients with de novo glioblastomas treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. No glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. These results suggest that therapies targeting glutamate may be beneficial in tumour associated epilepsy.",Excluded
3719,"Correlation between fissured fibrous cap and contrast enhancement: preliminary results with the use of CTA and histologic validation. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrated that carotid plaques analyzed by CTA can show contrast plaque enhancement. The purpose of this preliminary work was to evaluate the possible association between the fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive (men = 25; average age = 66.8 +/- 9 years) symptomatic patients studied by use of a multidetector row CT scanner were prospectively analyzed. CTA was performed before and after contrast and radiation doses were recorded; analysis of contrast plaque enhancement was performed. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy en bloc; histologic sections were prepared and evaluated for fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to evaluate the differences between the 2 groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation on contrast plaque enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also calculated.RESULTS: Twelve patients had fissured fibrous cap. In 92% (11/12) of fissured fibrous cap-positive plaques, we found contrast plaque enhancement, whereas in 69% (24/35) of the plaques without fissured fibrous cap contrast plaque enhancement was found. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the contrast enhancement in plaques with fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 22.6) and without fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 12.9) (P = .011). On the regression analysis, both fissured fibrous cap and neovascularization were associated with contrast plaque enhancement (P = .0366 and P = .0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed an association between fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement with an area under the curve of 0.749 (P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with contrast plaque enhancement. Histologic analysis showed that the presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with a larger contrast plaque enhancement compared with the contrast plaque enhancement of plaques without fissured fibrous cap.",Excluded

2447,"Unmyelinated visceral afferents exhibit frequency dependent action potential broadening while myelinated visceral afferents do not. Sensory information arising from visceral organ systems is encoded into action potential trains that propagate along afferent fibers to target nuclei in the central nervous system. These information streams range from tight patterns of action potentials that are well synchronized with the sensory transduction event to irregular, patternless discharge with no clear correlation to the sensory input. In general terms these afferent pathways can be divided into unmyelinated and myelinated fiber types. Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the functional differences between these two types of afferents in terms of the preprocessing of sensory information into action potential trains (synchrony, frequency, duration, etc.), the reflexogenic consequences of this sensory input to the central nervous system and the ionic channels that give rise to the electrophysiological properties of these unique cell types. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any functional differences in the somatic action potential characteristics of unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents in response to different rates of sensory nerve stimulation. Our results showed that activity and frequency-dependent widening of the somatic action potential was quite prominent in unmyelinated but not myelinated vagal afferents. Spike broadening often leads to increased influx of Ca(2+) ions that has been associated with a diverse range of modulatory mechanisms both at the cell body and central synaptic terminations (e.g. increased neurotransmitter release.) We conclude that our observations are indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms for neural integration of sensory information arising from unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents.",Excluded
3192,"Sequential changes in cerebral blood flow, early neuropathological consequences and blood-brain barrier disruption following radiofrequency-induced localized hyperthermia in the rat. We investigated the temperature distribution, early histological changes, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and sequential changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) following hyperthermia ranging from 37 to 45 degrees C in a new rat model of radiofrequency-induced localized cerebral hyperthermia. Significant histological changes and BBB disruption were observed in brain regions heated to 43 degrees C and above. In the cortex heated to 41 degrees C, the CBF doubled 20 min after hyperthermia induction, and then returned gradually to the pre-hyperthermic level. In the cortex heated to 43 degrees C, the CBF increased to 134% of the baseline level 10 min after hyperthermia induction, and then fell gradually to reach its minimum level (31% of the baseline level). In the cortex heated to 45 degrees C, the CBF decreased immediately after hyperthermia induction to reach 10% of the baseline level. The results indicate that hyperthermia-induced cellular injury in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral ischaemia and the threshold temperature for such injury is 43 degrees C. This model is useful for investigating the effects of hyperthermia on various cerebral functions and the CBF changes demonstrated in the present study may provide key information for the analysis of other cerebral functions.",Excluded
2295,"[Problems and chances of high field magnetic resonance imaging]. [German]. The spatial, temporal and spectral resolution in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is in many cases currently not sufficient to detect submillimeter lesions or to image the dynamics of the beating heart. At present MRI systems at 1.5 T and 3 T are the standard units for clinical imaging. The use of ultrahigh magnetic fields of 7 T and higher increases the signal-to-noise ratio, which holds promise for a significant improvement of the spatial and/or temporal resolution as well as for new contrast mechanisms. With 7 T MRI, images of the brain have been acquired routinely with a spatial resolution of 0.3 mm. The theoretical improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is often not fully realized due to B1 inhomogeneities and contrast variations. With MRI at 7 T a notable increase in spatial resolution can be achieved. Methods such as time-of-flight MR angiography and susceptibility-weighted imaging (e.g. neurofunctional MRI, fMRI) profit especially from the higher field strengths. Transmission field inhomogeneities are still a major challenge for ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI and are also a partially unsolved safety problem. The use of UHF MRI is currently limited to special applications and the expected gain of the high field must be weighed against technical limitations in both image acquisition and interpretation.",Excluded
117,"Irradiation inactivation studies of the dopamine D1 receptor and dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat striatum. In frozen rat striatal tissue, exposed to 10 MeV electrons from a linear accelerator, the sizes of the dopamine (DA) D1 receptor and the DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase complex were determined using target size analysis. The number of D1 receptors (labelled by [3H]SCH 23390) declined monoexponentially with increasing radiation intensity, yielding a molecular weight (mol.wt.) of 80 kDa. Also the activity of the catalytic unit (C) of the adenylate cyclase (as measured by forskolin stimulation), decreased monoexponentially, however with a mol.wt. of 145 kDa. Both basal, DA- and fluoride (F-)-stimulated activity declined in a concave-downward fashion with a limiting mol.wt. of 134, 138 and 228 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that the basal and DA-stimulated activity originated from an enzyme complex with a mol.wt. of 325 kDa, a value close to the combined size of RGs and C. These data suggest that F- stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, which occurs by a Gs activation, does not cause dissociation of Gs into the alpha s and beta gamma subunits. Further, the DA-regulated adenylate cyclase apparently exists as a complex consisting of RGs and C; the mechanism of hormonal activation is a dissociation of C from this complex.",Included
2047,"Riluzole enhances ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity in human melanoma cells that ectopically express metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 in vitro and in vivo. PURPOSE: Brain metastases are a common preterminal event in patients with metastatic melanoma and require radiation therapy. Our group has previously shown that human GRM1 (hGRM1) expressing melanoma cells release excess extracellular glutamate and are growth inhibited by riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release. Riluzole-treated cells accumulate in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours, and then undergo apoptotic cell death. We evaluated whether riluzole enhanced radiosensitivity in melanoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate clonogenic survival after treatment in hGRM1 expressing and nonexpressing melanoma cells. Western immunoblots were performed to confirm apoptotic cell death. A xenograft mouse model was used to validate the in vitro experiments. Tumors harvested from the xenografts were fixed and stained for apoptosis and DNA damage markers.RESULTS: In the hGRM1-positive cell lines C8161 and UACC903, riluzole enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation; no difference was seen in the hGRM1-negative UACC930 cell line. C8161 cells treated with riluzole plus irradiation also showed the highest levels of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3; excised C8161 xenografts showed the greatest number of apoptotic cells by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001). On cell cycle analysis, a sequence-dependent enrichment in the G(2)/M phase was shown with the combination of riluzole and irradiation. Xenografts treated with riluzole and weekly radiation fractions showed significant growth inhibition and revealed markedly increased DNA damage.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown, in vitro and in vivo, that the combination of riluzole and ionizing radiation leads to greater cytotoxicity. These results have clinical implications for patients with brain metastases receiving whole brain radiation therapy.",Excluded

A prospective study to assess high-dose hypofractionated volume modulated arc radiotherapy feasibility and efficacy in canine meningiomas was conducted. Thirty-nine patients with encephalic and spinal meningiomas assumed from MRI findings were recruited and received high-dose hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy by a linear accelerator equipped with an external beam modulator micro-multileaf collimator and an XVI cone beam computed tomography system. The prescribed mean dose was 33 Gy in five fractions. The treatment feasibility was tested through planned and delivered dose agreement checks. Regular clinical examinations were performed during and after irradiation time, with regard to mentation, deambulation, cranial nerve dysfunction, and seizures. Serial MRI exams were done 60 days after irradiation and after 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo. Volumetric disease reduction criteria implemented with clinical neurological systematic evaluation were adopted to assess the course and to categorize patients' responses. Complete and partial responses were observed on the whole in 65.5% of alive patients 24 mo after irradiation. Two-yr overall and disease-specific survival rates were 74.3% and 97.4%, respectively, and the putative radiotoxic effects were found to be few and slight.

PURPOSE: To study the biochemical, quantitative histopathological and behavioural changes after 5 Gy whole body irradiation and its modulation by supplementation of Grewia asiatica extract (GAE) on male Swiss albino mice up to 30 days.MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this, healthy mice from an inbred colony were divided into five groups: (i) Control (vehicle treated); (ii) GAE treated--mice in this group were orally supplemented with GAE (700 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day) once daily for 15 consecutive days; (iii) Irradiated mice; (iv) GAE + irradiated--mice in this group were orally supplemented GAE for 15 days (once a day) prior to irradiation; and (v) Irradiated + GAE--mice in this group were administered GAE orally for 15 days (once a day) consequently after irradiation.RESULTS: Marked radiation induced changes in the amount of cerebellar lipid peroxidation (LPO), Glutathione (GSH), protein, nucleic acids and histopathological changes could be significantly (p < 0.001) ameliorated specially at later intervals by supplementation of GAE prior to and post irradiation. Radiation induced deficits in learning and memory were also significantly (p < 0.001) ameliorated.CONCLUSION: The result of present study showed that prior/post-supplementation of G. asiatica has radioprotective potential as well as neuroprotective properties against the radiation.",Included
1853,"Identification of novel p53 target genes in ionizing radiation response. The tumor suppressor p53 plays an essential role in cellular adaptation to stress. In response to ionizing radiation, p53 regulates the transcription of genes in a diverse set of pathways including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Previously, we identified by microarray analysis a set of genes that are transcriptionally activated or repressed in response to radiation exposure. In this study, we use computational methods and molecular techniques, including location analysis (ChIP-on-chip assay), to identify ionizing radiation-responsive genes that are directly regulated by p53. Among the 489 ionizing radiation-responsive genes examined, 38 genes were found to be p53 targets. Some of these genes are previously known to be directly regulated by p53 whereas others are novel p53 targets. We further showed that the novel p53 target genes are transcriptionally regulated by p53. The binding of p53 to promoters of target genes correlated with increased transcript levels of these genes in cells with functional p53. However, p53 binding and subsequent transcriptional activation of these target genes were significantly diminished in cells with mutant p53 and in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia, which have impaired p53 activation following ionizing radiation exposure. Identification and characterization of ionizing radiation-responsive p53 target genes extend our knowledge of the diverse role that p53 plays in the DNA damage response.",Excluded
793,"Microstructural changes in white matter associated with alcohol use in early phase psychosis: A diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and relaxometry study. Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that brain white matter (WM) abnormalities may be central to the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. Additionally, cannabis use and alcohol use are each associated with WM abnormalities, however there is limited data on these substances effects on WM microstructure in psychosis, especially early phase psychosis (EPP). This study examined the impact of cannabis use and alcohol use in WM in EPP (N=21) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transverse relaxation time of tissue water (T2), with the primary outcomes being mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2. Method(s): Analyses were performed at the full brain level using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis as well as within a predefined WM region of interest (ROI) implicated in psychosis (containing the left superior longitudinal fasciculus). Result(s): Our findings revealed that younger age of onset of regular alcohol use (greater than one drink per week) was associated with lower FA values in the left thalamic radiation, left parahippocampal and left amygdalar WM. Also, more frequent lifetime cannabis use was correlated with increased mean full brain FA, although this finding did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. There was no significant relationship found between FA and alcohol or cannabis use within the ROI. Relaxometry analysis revealed trend level evidence of shortened T2 with more frequent cannabis use. Conclusion(s): This study provides novel data demonstrating cortical and subcortical WM changes related to alcohol use in EPP and is the first to combine DTI and relaxometry as it relates to this patient population.",Excluded
1156,"Supramolecular arrangement of the fulllength Zika virus NS5. Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has emerged as a major public health threat, since ZIKV infection has been connected to microcephaly and other neurological disorders. Flavivirus genome replication is driven by NS5, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that also contains a N-terminal methyltransferase domain essential for viral mRNA capping. Given its crucial roles, ZIKV NS5 has become an attractive antiviral target. Here, we have used integrated structural biology approaches to characterize the supramolecular arrangement of the full-length ZIKV NS5, highlighting the assembly and interfaces between NS5 monomers within a dimeric structure, as well as the dimer-dimer interactions to form higher order fibril-like structures. The relative orientation of each monomer within the dimer provides a model to explain the coordination between MTase and RdRP domains across neighboring NS5 molecules and mutational studies underscore the crucial role of the MTase residues Y25, K28 and K29 in NS5 dimerization. The basic residue K28 also participates in GTP binding and competition experiments indicate that NS5 dimerization is disrupted at high GTP concentrations. This competition represents a first glimpse at a molecular level explaining how dimerization might regulate the capping process. Copyright © 2019 Ferrero et al.

82,"Utility of cranial boost in addition to total body irradiation in the treatment of high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Purpose: Total body irradiation (TBI) as part of a conditioning regimen before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an important component in the management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has relapsed or has other certain high-risk features. Controversy exists, however, as to whether a cranial boost in addition to TBI is necessary to prevent central nervous system (CNS) recurrences in these high-risk cases. Previous national trials have included a cranial boost in the absence of data to justify its use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess risk of CNS recurrence in ALL patients treated with TBI, to identify subsets of these high-risk patients at an increased or decreased risk of CNS recurrence after TBI, and to investigate whether regimens with higher doses of cranial irradiation further reduce the risk of CNS recurrence. Methods and Materials: Charts of 67 consecutively treated patients with ALL who received TBI before HSCT were reviewed. Data including patient demographics, clinical features at presentation, conditioning regimen, donor source, use of a cranial boost, remission stage at transplant, histologic subtype, cytogenetics, and extramedullary site of presentation were retrospectively collected and correlated with the risk of subsequent CNS recurrence. Result(s): At the time of analysis, 30 (45%) patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 8 (12%) were alive with recurrence of leukemia, 7 (10.5%) had recurrent ALL but with successful salvage, 7 (11%) died subsequent to recurrence, 14 (21%) died from complications related to HCST, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up (1.5%). Of the patients who recurred after HSCT, the relapses were hematologic in 13 (57%), CNS with or without simultaneous marrow involvement in 3 (13%), and other sites in 7 (30%). Forty-one (61%) patients did not receive an extracranial boost of irradiation with TBI. Two of these patients (4.9%) suffered CNS failures compared with 1 of 26 (3.8%) who received a cranial boost (p = 0.84). None of the 40 patients who presented only with hematologic disease developed a CNS recurrence despite the fact that only 13 of 40 of these patients received a cranial boost after TBI. Cranial boost was therefore not associated with a reduction in CNS recurrence, especially in patients with only hematologic disease at presentation for which there were no failures regardless of the use of additional cranial radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): Patients who present with hematologic disease only at the time of HSCT have a low risk of CNS recurrence after TBI regardless of the use of a cranial boost, suggesting that a cranial boost may not be necessary in these patients. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

2190,"Calvarial and skull base metastases: expanding the clinical utility of Gamma Knife surgery. OBJECT: Traditionally, the treatment of choice for patients with metastases to the calvaria or skull base has been conventional radiation therapy. Because patients with systemic malignancies are also at risk for intracranial metastases, the utility of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for these patients has been explored to reduce excess radiation exposure to the perilesional brain parenchyma. The purpose of this study was to report the efficacy of GKS for the treatment of calvarial metastases and skull base lesions.METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of 21 patients with at least 1 calvarial or skull base metastatic lesion treated with GKS during 2001-2013. For 7 calvarial lesions, a novel technique, in which a bolus was placed over the treatment site, was used. For determination of local control or disease progression, radiation therapy data were examined and posttreatment MR images and oncology records were reviewed. Survival times from the date of procedure were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analyses.RESULTS: The median patient age at treatment was 57 years (range 29-84 years). A total of 19 (90%) patients received treatment for single lesions, 1 patient received treatment for 3 lesions, and 1 patient received treatment for 4 lesions. The most common primary tumor was breast cancer (24% of patients). Per lesion, the median clinical and radiographic follow-up times were 10.3 months (range 0-71.9 months) and 7.1 months (range 0-61.3 months), respectively. Of the 26 lesions analyzed, 14 (54%) were located in calvarial bones and 12 (46%) were located in the skull base. The median lesion volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 0.3-55.6 cm(3)), and the median prescription margin dose was 15 Gy (range 13-24 Gy). The median overall survival time for all patients was 35.9 months, and the 1-year local control rate was 88.9% (95% CI 74.4%-100%). Local control rates did not differ between lesions treated with the bolus technique and those treated with traditional methods or between calvarial lesions and skull base lesions (p > 0.05). Of the 3 patients for whom local treatment failed, 1 patient received no further treatment and 2 patients responded to salvage chemotherapy. Subsequent brain parenchymal metastases developed in 2 patients, who then underwent GKS.CONCLUSIONS: GKS is an effective treatment modality for patients with metastases to the calvarial bones or skull base. For patients with superficial calvarial lesions, a novel approach with bolus application resulted in excellent rates of local control. GKS provides an effective therapeutic alternative to conventional radiation therapy and should be considered for patients at risk for calvarial metastases and brain parenchymal metastases.",Excluded
3017,"Neoadjuvant versus definitive chemoradiation in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. BACKGROUND: Multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (nCRT + S) is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or node-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (E-SCC). Those who are unsuitable or who decline surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiation (dCRT). This study compares the oncologic outcome of nCRT + S and dCRT in E-SCC patients.METHODS: Between 2011 and 2017, 95 patients with E-SCC were scheduled for dCRT or nCRT+ S with IMRT at our department. Patients undergoing dCRT received at least 50 Gy and those undergoing nCRT + S received at least 41.4 Gy. All patients received simultaneous chemotherapy with either carboplatin and paclitaxel or cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. We retrospectively compared baseline characteristics and oncologic outcome including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and site of failure between both treatment groups.RESULTS: Patients undergoing dCRT were less likely to have clinically suspected lymph node metastases (85% vs. 100%, p = 0.019) than patients undergoing nCRT + S and had more proximally located tumors (median distance from dental arch to cranial tumor border 20 cm vs. 26 cm, p < 0.001). After a median follow up of 25.6 months for surviving patients, no significant differences for OS and PFS were noticed comparing nCRT + S and dCRT. However, the rate of local tumor recurrence was significantly higher in patients treated with dCRT than in those treated with nCRT + S (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.002). Within a multivariate Cox regression model, age, tumor location, and tumor grading were the only independent parameters affecting OS and PFS. In addition to that, proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently associated with an increased risk for local treatment failure.CONCLUSION: In E-SCC patients treated with either dCRT or nCRT + S, a higher rate of local tumor recurrence was seen in patients treated with dCRT than in patients treated with nCRT + S. There was at least a trend towards an improved OS and PFS in patients undergoing nCRT + S. However, this should be interpreted with caution, because proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently affecting the risk of local tumor recurrence.",Excluded
3322,"Defining survival for patients with breast cancer with brain metastases. Background: Brain metastases account for 100,000 to 170,000 cases per year in the U.S, the bulk being from breast and lung primaries. About 10-15% of breast cancer patients develop brain metastases and historically, their survival has been poor. Introduction of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents and newer radiation techniques in the past decade has led to better control of systemic disease raising the possibility of increasing incidence of brain metastases as well as better control of CNS disease. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases in our practice in the last 10 years. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart analysis and we analyzed the charts of 18 patients with breast cancer who had developed brain metastases. The parameters analyzed included patient age at diagnosis of breast cancer and at development of brain metastases, receptor status and various treatment modalities used to control local as well as Metastatic disease. Result(s): The median survival time after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and the number of brain metastases was 55 months. The time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age and number of brain metastases. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significant with a p-value of 0.007 and the number of brain metastases was not significant with a p-value of 0.55. Using the Log Rank test, median survival for Her2neu positive patients was 71 months and for Her2neu negative patients was 58 months with a non-significant p value of 0.86. Review of treatment modalities revealed that six patients underwent surgical removal of metastases and 12 patients received WBRT. Average number of systemic treatments used was 6.7 including chemotherapeutic, biological and hormonal agents. Conclusion(s): In our practice, the overall survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases was found to be 55 months after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and number of brain metastases.

2130,"2MO Radiotherapy in cancer is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor patient outcomes. Background: Diffuse gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors that invariably relapse despite treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy. Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy can drive tumors to develop a hypermutator phenotype. In contrast, the genomic effects of radiation therapy (RT) remain unknown. Method(s): We analyzed the mutational spectra following treatment with ionizing radiation in sequencing data from 190 paired primary-recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset and 2249 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Result(s): We identified a significant increase in the burden of small deletions following radiation therapy that was independent of other factors. These novel deletions demonstrated distinct characteristics when compared to pre-existing deletions present prior to RT-treatment and deletions in RT-untreated tumors. Radiation therapy-acquired deletions were characterized by a larger deletion size (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=1.2e-02 and P=8e-11, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test), an increased distance to repetitive DNA elements (P<2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and a reduction in microhomology at breakpoints (P=3.2e-02, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These observations suggested that canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) was the preferred pathway for DNA double strand break repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, radiotherapy resulted in frequent chromosomal deletions and significantly increased frequencies of CDKN2A homozygous deletions. Finally, a high burden of RT-associated deletions was associated with worse clinical outcomes (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=4.7e-02, HR=2.59 [95% CI: 1.01, 6.60] and P=2.5e-02, HR=1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.94], respectively; multivariable Cox regression). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that effective repair of RT-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival and that inhibiting c-NHEJ may be a viable strategy for improving the cancer-killing effect of radiotherapy. Taken together, the identified genomic scars as a result of radiation therapy reflect a more aggressive tumor with increased levels of resistance to follow up treatments.

Purpose/Objective(s): Immune check-point inhibition with CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma. This study investigated safety and efficacy associated with check-point inhibitors (CPIs) concurrent with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in melanoma patients with brain metastases. Materials/Methods: Prospectively collected data were analyzed from an IRB-approved registry of 428 patients with 2830 brain metastases treated with SRS from 2012-2015. Melanoma patients treated with SRS within 1 month of administration of a CPI were identified as being treated concurrently. Patients treated concurrently were matched 1:1 with a control group of melanoma patients treated with SRS alone. All patients had preand post-SRS T1-and T2-weighted MRIs. Categorical variables were compared with Fisher's exact tests, continuous variables with independent sample t-tests, and the log-rank test was used for survival and disease control analyses. Statistical tests were two-tailed, with the significance level set at a<0.05. Result(s): Twenty one melanoma patients with 104 brain metastases were treated concurrently with GKRS and a CPI. Ten patients were treated with Ipilimumab, ten with Pembrolizumab, and one with Nivolumab. Matched patients had no statistically significant differences in age, gender, performance status, extracranial disease burden, prior radiation, peri-SRS steroid use, number of brain lesions or total brain tumor volume treated. Patients treated with concurrent CPIs and SRS were significantly more likely to have any post-treatment increases in T1 post-contrast and T2-FLAIR volumes (52 vs 19%; P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in rates of adverse radiation effects, steroid use at follow-up, or decompressive craniotomies. There were also no significant differences in local control, distant brain failure, or rates of salvage whole brain radiation or SRS. There was a non-significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) with concurrent CPIs compared with matched controls (11.6 vs 8.8 months, P = 0.80) and a significantly longer median OS than predicted by Diagnosis-Specific GPA (DS-GPA) scores (11.6 vs 4.7 months, P = 0.05).1 Median OS for matched controls was not significantly different than that predicted by their DS-GPA scores. Conclusion(s): Melanoma patients with brain metastases treated concurrently with SRS and CPIs are more likely than patients treated with SRS alone to demonstrate imaging changes without apparent clinical consequences. No differences in disease outcomes were found based on CPI use, however median OS was better than predicted for patients treated concurrently with SRS and CPIs.",Excluded
111,"Left fronto-temporal lobe dementia caused by gamma knife surgery in an elderly woman. Introduction: Dementing processes in the geriatric population are devastating and can result in early death and increased care giver burden. FTD has the core features of earlier decline and impairment in regulation of social interpersonal conduct.We describe a case of an elderly female who was found to have features of FTD which had directly resulted from gamma knife surgery. This is the first described case of left FTD secondary to gamma knife radiation to our knowledge. Case: The patient is a 76 year old African American female, otherwise healthy and on no any medications with a history of a left frontotemporal arteriovenous malformation. She underwent gamma knife radiation treatment resulting in radiation necrosis eight years prior to presentation. She presented to the clinic escorted by her daughter who observed personality changes in the patient including becoming argumentative, uncooperative, and increasingly hyper religious, with increased interpersonal conflicts surrounding patient's inability to follow-through on plans. The patient only admitted to trouble with memory. Patient was observed to have disinhibition and inappropriateness during the group interview. Geriatric Depression Scale was negative for depression. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15/30 with deficits including: recall 0/5, language (1/3 naming, 0/2 repetition, 0/1 fluency with only 3 F words), calculation 0/3; while attention and orientations were intact. Patient was unable to perform Trail-making test, Part B. Otherwise, she appeared robust, independent in ADL but needing some assistance with IADL. Given her behavioral changes including tactlessness and poor social judgment, executive dysfunction, memory impairment and language deficits in the context of prior left frontal lobe radiation injury, she was given the diagnosis of left predominant FTD. Conclusion(s): Isolated and localized brain anomalies and their treatment are the rare causes of brain dysfunctions. In this unfortunate case, our patient's FTD is a direct result of her iatrogenic radiation necrosis. Appropriate diagnosis of this patient's condition via correlation of her cognitive deficit with radiographic findings allowed for appropriate counseling of both the patient and family in regards to the permanent nature of her condition. This in turn resulted in acceptance of her condition by her family, establishing prognosis and helping to facilitate her long term care plan.",Excluded

Result(s): Twenty-two of 23 tumors (96%) were either smaller (n = 12) or unchanged in size (n = 10) after radiosurgery. One patient with a malignant schwannoma had tumor progression outside the irradiated volume despite having both radiosurgery and fractionated radiation therapy (50.4 Gy); he died 4 years later. Morbidity related to radiosurgery occurred in 4 patients (17%). Three of 10 patients with trigeminal schwannomas suffered new or worsened trigeminal dysfunction after radiosurgery. One patient with a hypoglossal schwannoma had eustachian tube dysfunction after radiosurgery. No patient with a lower cranial nerve schwannoma developed any hearing loss, facial weakness, or swallowing difficulty after radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): Although the reported number of patients having radiosurgery for nonvestibular schwannomas is limited, the high tumor control rates demonstrated after vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery should apply to these rare tumors. Compared to historical controls treated with surgical resection, radiosurgery appears to have less treatment-associated morbidity for nonvestibular schwannomas, especially for schwannomas involving the lower cranial nerves. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
2908,[Use of DNA antibodies for detecting DNA radiation injuries in the bone marrow cell nuclei of irradiated animals]. Impairments in DNA from brain stem cell nuclei of X-ray irradiated animals were studied at early steps after irradiation using antibodies to single-stranded DNA. A possibility was shown to detect by means of an immunochemical technique the irradiation-induced impairments of DNA in brain stem cells. Detection of the impairment was possible within 3 hrs after high doses of the irradiation (206.4-258 mCi/kg); after lower doses - within the first hour of the postirradiation period. The immunochemical procedure might be used for early biological detection of the irradiation impairments as well as for estimation of radio-sensitivity of nuclear cells to the effects of irradiation and radioprotectors.,Included
3391,"Rod photoreceptor dysfunction in diabetes: activation, deactivation, and dark adaptation. PURPOSE: To examine photoreceptor function in diabetes in detail by evaluating photoreceptor light activation, deactivation of the photoresponse, and recovery of the photoreceptor after bleaching (dark adaptation) in rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ).METHODS: Animals were assigned to treated and control groups. Light activation in rod photoreceptors was established using a paired-flash electroretinogram (ERG) protocol, and the leading edge of the a-wave was modeled with the mechanisms mediating phototransduction. Deactivation of the photoreceptor response was evaluated at three luminous exposures (1.4-2.2 log cd.m/s-2) using a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigm. Dark adaptation was evaluated at 90-second intervals for 30 minutes after approximately 20% pigment bleach. At each time point, a paired-flash signal (1.4 log cd.s/m-2) was used to extract rod responses.RESULTS: Diabetic animals showed decreased amplitudes of the photoreceptor response 12 weeks after diabetes induction. No difference was found in the rate of deactivation of the photoresponse in diabetic rats. Normalized amplitudes showed that diabetic animals had significantly faster dark adaptation (P<0.01) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although photoreceptor activation was abnormal, deactivation was unaltered after 12 weeks of diabetes. The faster relative recovery found in diabetes after bleach, in the presence of normal pigment dynamics, may reflect a decrease in outer segment lengths.",Excluded
2164,"A case of a breast cancer patient with cardiac metastasis. [Japanese]. The patient was a 65-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Stage ffi A triple-negative breast cancer (T2N2aM0) at the age of 63. AC chemotherapy (3 months) followed by paditaxel plus bevacizumab (4 months) was administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, she underwent mastectomy and lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed a partial response. After surgery, radiotherapy with a radiation dose of 50 Gy was applied to the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph node. Multiple pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymph node metastases were diagnosed 23 months after initial treatment, and she was treated with S-1 administration. Two months after S-1 treatment, the PET-CT showed metastasis in the right atrium. Since there were no cardiac symptoms, S-1 treatment was continued without cardiovascular treatment. However, the mediastinal lymph node metastasis progressed; and therefore, S-1 administration was stopped and chemotherapy with eribulin was initiated. Brain metastasis was diagnosed at the same time and treated with a gamma knife. Although chemotherapy with eribulin was continued, the patient died 33 months after initial treatment owing to the brain metastasis. The cardiac metastasis did not progress during chemotherapy with eribulin. There was no sign of heart failure or arrhythmia during the treatment.

626,"Superoxide dismutase (sod-1) null mutants of Neurospora crassa: oxidative stress sensitivity, spontaneous mutation rate and response to mutagens. Enzymatic superoxide-dismutase activity is believed to be important in defense against the toxic effects of superoxide. Although superoxide dismutases are among the best studied proteins, numerous questions remain concerning the specific biological roles of the various superoxide-dismutase types. In part, this is because the proposed damaging effects of superoxide are manifold, ranging from inactivation of certain metabolic enzymes to DNA damage. Studies with superoxide-deficient mutants have proven valuable, but surprisingly few such studies have been reported. We have constructed and characterized Neurospora crassa mutants that are null for sod-1, the gene that encodes copper-zinc superoxide dismutase. Mutant strains are sensitive to paraquat and elevated oxygen concentrations, and they exhibit an increased spontaneous mutation rate. They appear to have near wild-type sensitive to near- and far-UV, heat shock and gamma-irradiation. Unlike the equivalent Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant and the sodA sodB double mutant of Escherichia coli, they do not exhibit aerobic auxotrophy. These results are discussed in the context of an attempt to identify consensus phenotypes among superoxide dismutase-deficient mutants. N. crassa sod-1 null mutant strains were also employed in genetic and subcellular fractionation studies. Results support the hypothesis that a single gene (sod-1), located between Fsr-12 and leu-3 on linkage group I, is responsible for most or all CuZn superoxide dismutase activity in this organism.",Excluded
3397,"Treatment of near-skull brain tissue with a focused device using shear-mode conversion: a numerical study. Shear mode transmission through the skull has been previously proposed as a new trans-skull propagation technique for noninvasive therapeutic ultrasound (Clement 2004 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD). The differences of the degree of focusing observed among patients suggest that the intersection A(SW) intersection A(TX) can be used as a preliminary criterion for screening and calculation of the acoustic fields should confirm the degree of focusing patient by patient. In conclusion, shear waves provide a useful method for trans-cranial focusing in regions close to the skull surface.",Excluded
1720,"Properties of paired-pulse firing thresholds and the relationship with paired-pulse plasticity in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. A large variability of paired-pulse plasticity (PPP) has been reported in CA3-CA1 synapses, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) has long been extensively used as a relative index of release probability (P(r)) from the presynaptic terminal. One of the most common ways of studying P(r) and PPP is to pass paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) through an electrode to fire an action potential (AP), which in turn opens Ca(2+) channels in the presynaptic boutons to evoke transmitter release. However, when the postsynaptic responses were elicited by electrical stimulations, the presynaptic APs were usually not monitored. The reliability of presynaptic activation, the difference of AP firing thresholds between the first and the second pulses of PPS, and its relationship with P(r) and PPP have been largely ignored. Here we show that the AP firing thresholds in the same CA3 pyramidal cells (axons) are obviously lower for the second pulses of the PPS than for the first pulses. When single (or small numbers of) presynaptic axons were stimulated by low-intensity PPS, a large variation in the postsynaptic response probability of the first pulses (P(res1)) and PPP was observed. Increasing stimulation intensities resulted in the conversion of a lower P(res1) and PPF to a higher P(res1) and paired-pulse depression. These results indicate that changes in the reliability of AP initiation by the first pulse of the PPS may account for the high variability of P(res1) and PPP observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, therefore PPF may not be a reliable index of P(r) .",Excluded
903,"Dose Reduction in Contrast-Enhanced Cervical MR Angiography: Field Strength Dependency of Vascular Signal Intensity, Contrast Administration, and Arteriographic Quality. OBJECTIVE: Cervical contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) has proven accurate and superior to noncontrast alternatives. We proposed the systematic investigation of dose reduction in contrast-enhanced MRA, hypothesizing heightened tolerance at 3 T vs 1.5 T. Quantitative and qualitative features were compared between full-dose and 50%-reduced dose examinations at 1.5 T and 3 T.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight cervical contrast-enhanced MRA examinations were reviewed for qualitative and quantitative (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) features across four dose-field strength combinations: 1.5 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 3 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 1.5 T, 0.1 mmol/kg; and 3 T, 0.1 mmol/kg. Quantitative features were evaluated among the following segments: aortic arch, common carotid arteries, common carotid bifurcations, and cervical internal carotid arteries. A qualitative visual rating scale was applied for the same segments as well as to the vertebral arteries along their proximal (V1), intraforaminal (V2), and distal extraforaminal (V3) courses. Significant between-group differences were reported at p < 0.05.RESULTS: Qualitatively good arteriography was observed in all segments for all protocols. No significant qualitative differences between protocols were noted throughout evaluation of the anterior cervical circulation. Significant qualitative differences were observed only for V2 and V3 segments at half-dose 1.5-T compared with the remaining protocols (p < 0.05). No significant quantitative differences were present between full-dose and dose-reduced 3-T MRA in any segment. At 1.5 T, significant decrement in SNR and CNR at half-dose was present only within the cervical internal carotid artery.CONCLUSION: Dose reduction in cervical contrast-enhanced MRA is feasible at 3 T without significant compromise in arteriographic quality in most segments. Particularly at 3 T, arteriography is quantitatively and qualitatively robust and may be advisable in high-risk patients.",Excluded
1610,"COX-2 expression in the guinea pig cochlea is partly altered by moderate sound exposure. The cyclooxygenase-2 isoform (COX-2) was found recently to be constitutively expressed in the guinea pig inner ear. To gain knowledge about its role in sound perception, alterations in the COX-2 level of moderate noise-stimulated cochleae were determined. Staining intensities were quantified in different regions using an immunohistochemical staining procedure and computer-assisted system. After 70 dB and 90 dB noise exposure for 1 h at 8000 Hz, COX-2 downregulation was observed in the organ of Corti, which was most prominent in Deiters' cells near Hensen cells and outer hair cells. In pillar cells, COX-2 levels were only slightly reduced after 70 dB but strongly diminished after 90 dB exposure. In Hensen cells, COX-2 was downregulated after 70 dB stimulation, revealing a decreasing COX-2 content from the third to the first turn of the cochlea and a homogeneously reduced enzyme expression in all three turns after 90 dB. The COX-2 content in inner hair cells was nearly identical to unexposed cochleae after 70 dB exposure but significantly reduced after 90 dB stimulation. In spiral ganglion cells, stria vascularis, spiral ligament and limbus, COX-2 expression was unchanged after 70 dB and 90 dB. We suggest that alterations in COX-2 expression might contribute to diminished sensitivity at the cochlea after noise exposure to reduce subsequent noise distress, termed sound conditioning.",Excluded

PURPOSE: [(18)F]UCB-H is a novel radiotracer with a high affinity for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein expressed in synaptic vesicles. SV2A is the binding site of levetiracetam, a ""first-in-class"" antiepileptic drug with a distinct but still poorly understood mechanism of action. The objective of this study was to determine the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [(18)F]UCB-H in a human clinical trial and to establish injection limits according to biomedical research guidelines. Additionally, the clinical radiation dosimetry results were compared to estimations in previously published preclinical data.PROCEDURES: Dynamic whole body positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was performed over approximately 110 min on five healthy male volunteers after injection of 144.5 +/- 7.1 MBq (range, 139.1-156.5 MBq) of [(18)F]UCB-H. Major organs were delineated on CT images, and time-activity curves were obtained from co-registered dynamic PET emission scans. The bladder could only be delineated on PET images. Time-integrated activity coefficients were calculated as area under the curve using trapezoidal numerical integration. Urinary excretion data based on PET activities including voiding was also simulated using the dynamic bladder module of OLINDA/EXM. The radiation dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM.RESULTS: The effective dose to the OLINDA/EXM 70-kg standard male was 1.54 x 10(-2) +/- 6.84 x 10(-4) millisieverts (mSv)/MBq, with urinary bladder wall, gallbladder wall, and the liver receiving the highest absorbed dose. The brain, the tracer's main organ of interest, received an absorbed dose of 1.89 x 10(-2) +/- 2.32 x 10(-3) mGy/MBq.CONCLUSIONS: This first human dosimetry study of [(18)F]UCB-H indicated that the tracer shows similar radiation burdens to widely used common clinical tracers. Single injections of at maximum 672 MBq for US practice and 649 MBq for European practice keep radiation exposure below recommended limits.

3475,"Selective decrease in serotonin synthesis rate in rat brainstem raphe nuclei following chronic administration of low doses of amitriptyline: an effect compatible with an anti-migraine effect. The effects of chronic, low-dose amitriptyline on serotonin (5-HT) synthesis rate were measured in rat brain using autoradiography and the trapping of alpha-[14C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[14C]-MTrp). Rats received amitriptyline (2 mg/kg per day) or saline via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps for 21 days. Amitriptyline had no effect on any physiological parameters measured, or on free or total plasma tryptophan levels. However, amitriptyline exerted selective decreases of 15% and 17% (P < 0.001) in serotonin synthesis rates in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, respectively. There was no reduction in any of the projection areas studied, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus or striatum. The data suggest that chronic low doses of amitriptyline can lead to sustained 5-HT re-uptake inhibition selectively in the raphe nuclei, an effect compatible with tonic activation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT synthesis. The failure of chronic amitriptyline treatment to affect 5-HT synthesis rate in the projection areas may ensure an adequate regulation of pain pathways implicated in migraine headache, an effect possibly related to amitriptyline anti-migraine efficacy.",Excluded
1308,"Zebrafish as a ""biosensor""? Effects of ionizing radiation and amifostine on embryonic viability and development. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a popular vertebrate model system for cancer and treatment-related research. Benefits include ease of care, rapid development, optical clarity of embryos, which allows visualization of major organ systems, and opportunities for genetic manipulation. However, specific parameters of radiation sensitivity have not been systematically documented. We investigated the effects of radiation and a radiomodifier on zebrafish viability and embryonic development. Embryos were exposed to gamma-radiation (5, 10, or 20 Gy) at sequential times postfertilization and serially assessed for viability and morphologic abnormalities. As expected, lethality and morphologic perturbations were more pronounced earlier in embryogenesis and with higher radiation doses and were partially reversed by amifostine. The effects of radiation and concurrent treatment with amifostine on the developmental organization of the eye and brain were striking. Radiation resulted in hypocellularity and disorganization of the cellular layers of the retina, effects partially reversed by amifostine, as well as lens opacification. Radiation strikingly reduced the volume of brain, but the volume loss was substantially blocked by amifostine. Increased terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling signal was noted in both the irradiated eye and brain, but reduced by amifostine. Finally, irradiating embryos resulted in caspase activation detectable in 96-well microplates, which was proportional to the number of embryos and radiation dose; the degree of activation was markedly reduced by amifostine. These results together suggest the power and versatility of the zebrafish in assessing the effects of radiation and radiomodifiers on organ and tissue development.",Excluded
1074,"Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy enhances radiation-induced abscopal response in glioblastoma. Introduction: Immunotherapy for glioblastoma have been largely unsuccessful, in part, because molecular heterogeneity drives selective elimination of only a subset of tumor cells. Therefore, therapeutic success in patients will require achieving an 'abscopal effect' where following focused radiation therapy, non-targeted tumor cells are attacked by the immune system. It remains unclear how glioblastoma respond to focused radiation in terms of failure location and whether immunotherapy could amplify the immune response to tumor outside the radiation field. Method(s): We evaluated patterns of treatment failure and outcomes in glioblastoma patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; N=47). To optimize the abscopal effect, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse model of bilateral glioblastoma. Here, one side of the mouse brain has a tumor treated by focal radiation and the contralateral untreated tumor is used as a readout of abscopal therapeutic efficacy following anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Result(s): In glioblastoma patients receiving SRS, increasing age (>60 years) as associated with more 'out of field' treatment failure (P=0.036) and poor survival (P=0.001). In mice, we find that focal radiation of one tumor combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy induced an immunological response against tumor cells outside the radiation field and enhanced survival (P<0.05). Significant macrophage and T-cell infiltration occurred in mesenchymal subtype-like tumors (N=6-8 mice per group, P <0.01). In proneural subtype-like tumors, macrophage infiltration alone was associated with 'out of field' tumor regression (N=8 mice per group, P<0.05). In-vitro, treatment of mouse macrophages with anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced significant gene expression changes and enhanced phagocytosis in an ERK-dependent fashion. All 3 commercially available human anti-PD-L1 antibodies also induced ERK signaling with varying efficacies. Conclusion(s): Focal radiation combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy induces an immunological response to un-irradiated glioblastoma. We are currently optimizing other treatment combinations that could also be readily assessed in phase I human clinical trials.",Excluded

Patients who received biopsy only were excluded. The time from surgery to initiation of radiation therapy was divided into 4 equal quartiles of <=24, 25 to 30, 31 to 37, and >37 d. Patient characteristics were compared between groups using Pearson Chi Square and Fisher's Exact test. OS was analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared via the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression were performed to assess for impact of covariables on OS.RESULTS: A total of 11 652 patients were included in the analysis. Median duration from surgery to radiation was 30 d. On multivariable regression, black race, larger tumor, gross-total resection, methyguanine-methyl transferase (MGMT+), and treatment at an academic facility were associated with a duration >30 d.

3722,"Goniometric measurement for the estimation of anisotropy coefficient of human and animal pancreas. Estimation of optical properties of biologic tissues is determinant for laser dosimetry in medical applications. Tissues highly absorb and scatter the light in near infrared spectrum, where the laser provides therapeutic effects. Novel frontiers of clinical practice, e.g., the employment of laser light for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, require information about pancreas-laser interaction, which are crucial for therapy management. The property of biological tissues to scatter the light traveling through is described by the anisotropy coefficient (g). The relationship between g and the angular distribution of the scattered light is described by Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The measurement of angular distribution of scattered light is performed by the goniometric technique. This paper describes the estimation of g of ex vivo pancreas at 1064 nm, performed by a goniometric-based system, where a photodetector measures intensities of scattered light at fixed angles between -120degree and 120degree. A two-term Henyey-Greenstein phase function has been employed to estimate anisotropy coefficient for forward (gfs) and backward scattering (gbs). Experimental trails were performed to assess the repeatability of measurement system: percentage value of standard deviation is generally lower than 8% for angles higher (lower) than 13degree (13degree). Measurements were performed for the first time on healthy swine pancreas, aiming to investigate the influence of coagulation temperature: gfs decreases from 0.94 (at 25 degreeC) to 0.93 (at 80 degreeC). Afterwards, the same set up has been employed for the estimation of g of human pancreas affected by neuroendocrine tumor, which presented an estimated values for gfs of 0.89.",Excluded

Brain metastases from luminal A and B types of breast cancer arose more often in the cerebellum. Brain metastases from HER2-positive type breast cancer occurred more often in the putamen and the thalamus and less frequently in the cerebellum than other types (P=0.0057).

312,"Synapses in the fly motion-vision pathway: evidence for a broad range of signal amplitudes and dynamics. Synapses are generally considered to operate efficiently only when their signaling range matches the spectrum of prevailing presynaptic signals in terms of both amplitudes and dynamics. However, the prerequisites for optimally matching the signaling ranges may differ between spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. This poses a problem for synapses that convey both graded and spike signals at the same time. We addressed this issue by tracing transmission systematically in vivo in the blowfly's visual-motion pathway by recording from single neurons that receive mixed potential signals consisting of rather slow graded fluctuations superimposed with highly variable spikes from a small number of presynaptic elements. Both pre- and postsynaptic neurons were previously shown to represent preferred-direction motion velocity reliably and linearly at low fluctuation frequencies. To selectively assess the performance of individual synapses and to precisely control presynaptic signals, we voltage clamped one of the presynaptic neurons. Results showed that synapses can effectively convey signals over a much larger amplitude and frequency range than is normally used during graded transmission of visual signals. An explanation for this unexpected finding might lie in the transmission of the spike component that reaches larger amplitudes and contains higher frequencies than graded signals.",Excluded

The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, fronto-parietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P. When MRPI and DTI measures were combined, the discriminatory power increased from 0.92 to 0.98 for PSP-RS vs. controls, from 0.70 to 0.82 for PSP-P vs. controls, and from 0.77 to 0.84 for PSP-RS vs. PSP-P. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of GM and WM alterations occur in PSP-RS and PSP-P. Adding DTI measures to MRPI improves the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating each PSP syndrome from healthy individuals and each other.",Excluded
2104,"Radiation dose to the neurovascular bundles or penile bulb does not predict erectile dysfunction after prostate brachytherapy. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between calculated doses to the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) and the penile bulb (PB) and the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) after low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDRPB) alone.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1997 and June 1999, 84 men were treated with LDRPB alone. Inclusion criteria for this study were (1) no ED according to a self-administered questionnaire before PB, (2) treatment with PB alone (125I; 144 Gy), (3) postimplant CT scan of the prostate 1 month after PB, and (4) minimum of 24 months of continuous follow-up. Fifty men met all inclusion criteria. ED was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire completed before and at each follow-up visit after LDRPB. Radiation doses to the NVB and PB were calculated on the basis of axial postimplant CT images. Multiple variables (patient-related and dosimetric quantifiers) that may predict for the development of ED were examined by univariate analysis.RESULTS: Thirty of the 50 men (60%) were potent at last follow-up. The only patient-related variable that predicted for the development of ED was patient age (<65 vs. >65 years; p=0.03). The calculated mean maximum doses to the NVB and PB were 684 Gy (range, 195-1277 Gy) and 498 Gy (range, 44-971 Gy), respectively. The mean calculated doses to 50% of the NVB and PB were 158 Gy (range, 76-240 Gy) and 43 Gy (range, 19-101 Gy), respectively. The calculated mean maximum, mean minimum, and mean doses to 50% of the NVB or PB did not differ between those men who developed ED and those men who did not develop ED. None of the dosimetric variables examined predicted the development of ED after LDRPB.CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, higher calculated doses to the NVB or PB are not associated with ED after LDRPB.",Excluded
306,"Visible light modulates the expression of cancer-retina antigens. Proteins involved in the visual signaling cascade show light-dependent expression levels in photoreceptor cells. Recently, these proteins have been described to be expressed in neuroectodermal tumors and to function as cancer-retina antigens. Here, we show that light can down-regulate gene expression of rhodopsin, transducin, and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) and up-regulate guanylyl cyclase 1, recoverin, and arrestin in human melanoma cells in vitro, comparable to physiologic changes earlier observed in photoreceptor cells. Similar modulation can be detected at the protein level in melanoma cells except for no changes in PDE6 protein levels. Two regulatory pathways have been identified: Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 proteins for rhodopsin and PDE6, and mitogen-activated protein kinases for recoverin and arrestin. The visual cascade and retinoic acid as its derivate do not play any role in this process. Putative explanations for light-dependent modulation of cancer-retina antigen expression in melanoma cells are discussed.",Excluded

3317,"The effect of a single whole-body irradiation with a lethal dose on catecholamine levels in the pineal glands of rats. Male Wistar rats adapted to light-dark cycle (LD) 12:12 h were exposed in the darkness to a lethal single dose of 14.35 Gy gamma-rays on the whole body. Irradiation, sham-irradiation and decapitation 30, 60, 120 min after the exposure, were performed between 2000 h and 0100 h in the darkness. The changes in the concentrations of catecholamines (CA) were determined by the radioenzymatic method in the pineal gland of rats. Results were evaluated in comparison with those of the sham-irradiated (30, 60, 120 min) control groups of rats. From the results it follows that the concentration of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the rat pineal gland significantly decreased 30 and 120 minutes after irradiation (p < 0.01). At min 60 of the postirradiation period it was possible to observe a tendency to recovery of the levels of DA and NE to control values. Epinephrine (EPI) exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) decrease at min 60 and 120 of postirradiation (by 61.8% and 62.8%, respectively).",Included
3516,Aortic arch injection with C-arm cone beam CT for radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Technical note. Background: C-arm cone beam CT (CBCT) with selective intra-arterial contrast injection combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is currently used for the evaluation and treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In some instances an AVM will derive its blood supply from more than one main cervical artery (carotid and/or vertebral artery) and a single-vessel injection will not adequately demonstrate the entire AVM nidus. Method(s): Three patients with cerebral AVM in whom the entire nidus could not be visualized by injection of a single cervical artery are reported. CBCT dataset acquisition was performed by intra-arterial contrast injection in the ascending thoracic aorta through a 5 F pigtail catheter. The injection of diluted iodinated contrast agent (35%) lasted 22 s at a rate of 8 ml/s for a total volume of 176 ml (61.6 ml of contrast agent). The dataset was then processed using standard reconstruction methods. Result(s): Contrast injection in the ascending aorta during a single CBCT acquisition provided a volumetric dataset adequate for subsequent radiosurgical treatment planning. Conclusion(s): This is a safe and effective angiographic technique for the acquisition of volumetric datasets using CBCT that are suitable for treatment planning of intracranial AVMs deriving their blood supply from more than one major cervical artery. This technique allows imaging of the entire AVM nidus during a single CBCT acquisition.,Excluded
51,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of sarcoma metastasis. Purpose/Objective(s): The role of conventional radiation in the management of sarcoma metastasis to the spine is limited due to its radioresistant nature. However, spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (sSRS) may have a radiobiological advantage given the high dose per fraction. The purpose of this study is to report our experience using sSRS to treat patients with sarcoma metastasis to the spine. Materials/Methods: Thirty-four lesions (17 patients) with sarcoma metastatic to the spine were identified from a large IRB-approved database. Pain relief post-sSRS was prospectively collected using the Brief Pain Inventory. Survival was calculated from date of procedure using Kaplan- Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine the association between clinical factors and pain relief. Result(s): Eligible patients had a median age of 55 years and 56% were female. Median KPS was 85 (range, 60-100) and median clinical follow-up was 7 months (range, 0-58). Location of metastasis included 44% cervical/ thoracic, 35% lumbar, and 21% sacral lesions. Approximately, 12% had cord compression, 32% had epidural compression, and 59% had neural foramen involvement at the time of treatment. Reason for treatment included 53% for pain, 21% for pain and neurological deficits, 1 patient had vertebral compression fracture and the remaining 24% were asymptomatic. Target volume was a median of 71 cc (range, 16-428 cc). Median maximum prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 14-16 Gy). In terms of prior treatment, 21% of patients had received prior cEBRT, 15% had prior SBRT, 29% had prior surgery, and 21% had received prior hardware. At 6 and 12 months, actuarial survival was 81% and 73%, radiographic control was 66% and 50%, and unadjusted pain control was 65% and 65%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that both radiographic failure and pain relief were associated with age, with older patients less likely to have radiographic failure (HR = 0.864, p = 0.0004) and pain relief (HR = 0.929, p = 0.0202). Unadjusted symptom failure was associated with a larger target volume (HR = 1.010, p = 0.0142), prior surgery (HR = 7.353, p = 0.0131), and prior hardware (HR = 4.717, p = 0.0244). Conclusion(s): We report an unadjusted pain control in 65% of sarcoma patients with spinal metastasis. Based on our previously published data and due to the comparatively lower radiographic and pain control rates when compared to other histologies, we recommend increasing the dose beyond 16 Gy for sarcomas.",Excluded
386,"Temozolomide for central nervous system involvement in mycosis fungoides. BACKGROUND: The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most commonly involved sites in the systemic progression of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) such as mycosis fungoides (MF). There is no consensus on the treatment of CNS progression in CTCL, but survival of 3-6 months is suggested when methotrexate-based chemotherapy and/or CNS irradiation is used. Temozolomide is active in earlier stages of MF and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There are no published data on its use in MF patients with CNS involvement.METHODS: Four MF patients were treated with oral temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 d on a 28-day cycle) for CNS progression. Two patients received temozolomide with low-dose CNS irradiation as initial treatment, and two received temozolomide following disease progression after methotrexate-based chemotherapy and CNS irradiation. All patients received dexamethasone.RESULTS: Temozolomide was well tolerated; there were no treatment withdrawals or dose reductions caused by toxicity. Patient 1 had an excellent partial response in pre-irradiated disease. Patient 2 showed disease stabilization following irradiation. Patient 3 showed a complete response after a partial response to irradiation. Patient 4 demonstrated continued stabilization after a partial response to irradiation. Overall survival ranged from 10 to 33 months. Patient 3 remains alive and symptom-free at 23 months following treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide following low-dose CNS irradiation appears to be well tolerated and effective in MF patients with CNS progression. It may represent a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy containing methotrexate or an option for second-line therapy.",Excluded
2450,"Surgical management of medium and large petroclival meningiomas: a single institution's experience of 199 cases with long-term follow-up. BACKGROUND: Petroclival meningiomas (PCMs) were once regarded as 'inoperable' due to their complex anatomy and limited surgical exposure. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgically treated PCMs larger than 2 cm.METHODS: A series of 199 consecutive patients (137 females, 68.8 %) with PCMs larger than 2 cm from between 1993 and 2003 were included. The clinical charts, radiographs, and follow-ups were evaluated.RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 111 (55.8 %) patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 65, and partial resection (PR) in 23. Cranial nerve dysfunctions were the most common complications and occurred in 133 (66.8 %) cases. The surgical mortality was 2.0 %. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores significantly decreased 1 month after the operations (preoperative KPS = 76.8 and postoperative KPS = 64.8; p = 0.011, Paired-samples t test). Long-term follow-ups were obtained in 142 patients, the follow-up duration was 171.6 months, and the most recent KPS was 83.2. Permanent morbidities remained in 24 patients (18.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that brainstem edema and tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter were independent risk factors in terms of outcomes (KPS < 80). The recurrence/progression rates were 14.5, 31.8, and 53.3 % for the GTR, STR, and PR cases, respectively (p = 0.002, Pearson chi (2) test). Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the remnants exhibited good tumor control.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes and low mortality were achieved with the microsurgical management of medium and large PCMs; however, the rates of cranial nerves dysfunction remained high. Radically aggressive resection might not be judicious in terms of postoperative morbidity. The preoperative evaluations and intraoperative findings were informative regarding the outcomes. The low follow-up rate likely compromised our findings, and additional consecutive studies were required.",Excluded
78,"Intensity modulated radiation therapy for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity: preliminary results. PURPOSE: To report preliminary results on using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as an adjuvant treatment in primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 2002 and March 2005, 31 adult patients with primary STS of the extremity were treated with surgery and adjuvant IMRT. Tumor size was >10 cm in 74% of patients and grade was high in 77%. Preoperative IMRT was given to 7 patients (50 Gy) and postoperative IMRT (median dose, 63 Gy) was given to 24 patients. Complete gross resection including periosteal stripping or bone resection was required in 10, and neurolysis or nerve resection in 20. The margins were positive or within 1 mm in 17. Complications from surgery and radiation therapy (RT) were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 23 months. Grade 1 RT dermatitis developed in 71% of patients, Grade 2 in 16%, and Grade 3 in 10%. Infectious wound complications developed in 13% and noninfectious complications in 10%. Two patients (6.4%) developed fractures. Grade 1 neuropathy developed in 28% of patients and Grade 2 in 5%. The rates of Grade 1 and 2 joint stiffness were each 19%. Grade 1 edema was observed in 19% of patients and Grade 2 in 13%. The 2-year local control, distant control, and overall survival were 95%, 65%, and 81%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Intensity modulated RT appears to provide excellent local control in a difficult group of high-risk patients. The morbidity profile is also favorable, but longer follow-up is needed to confirm the results from this study.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Medical X-rays are the largest man-made source of public exposure to ionizing radiation. While the benefits of Computed Tomography (CT) are well known in accurate diagnosis, those benefits are not risk-free. CT is a device with higher patient dose in comparison with other conventional radiation procedures.OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating radiation dose to patients from Computed Tomography (CT) examination in Mazandaran hospitals and defining diagnostic reference level (DRL).METHODS: Patient-related data on CT protocol for four common CT examinations including brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic were collected. In each center, Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI) measurements were performed using pencil ionization chamber and CT dosimetry phantom according to AAPM report No. 96 for those techniques. Then, Weighted Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIW), Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI vol) and Dose Length Product (DLP) were calculated.RESULTS: The CTDIw for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic ranged (15.6-73), (3.8-25. 8), (4.5-16.3) and (7-16.3), respectively. Values of DLP had a range of (197.4-981), (41.8-184), (131-342.3) and (283.6-486) for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic, respectively. The 3rd quartile of CTDIW, derived from dose distribution for each examination is the proposed quantity for DRL. The DRLs of brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic are measured 59.5, 17, 7.8 and 11 mGy, respectively.CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrated large scales of dose for the same examination among different centers.

PURPOSE: Nonvestibular cranial nerve schwannomas (NVCNS) are relatively rare tumors. We evaluated our experience with radiosurgical and microsurgical treatment alone and in combination for the management of NVCNS.METHODS: The charts of 62 patients with NVCNS who were treated between 1993 and 2005 at our institution were reviewed. Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results. When treatment with either modality alone is not reasonable, tumors can be managed effectively with combined micro- and radiosurgery treatment.",Included

1959,"Effectiveness of lead cap in radiation protection of head in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Aims: Occupational head exposure of radiation was suggested to be associated with brain tumors in interventional cardiologists. The brain is of particular interest, because it is one of the least protected organs during interventional procedures. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the lead cap in radiation protection of the head and compare it with that of a ceiling mounted lead glass screen in a real life setting. Our secondary goal was to test the comfort and convenience of the lead cap when worn on a regular daily basis. Methods and Results: Radiation dose to the operator was recorded by the three dosimeters placed outside the lead cap, inside the cap and outside the apron at the level of trunk for a total of 18 months. Only the lead cap (Burkhart Roentgen International, St Petersburg, Florida, USA) but not the ceiling suspended protective glass screen was used during the first three months of measurement of radiation dose to the head. Later concomitant use of both protection devices was analysed. The dosimeter outside the cap recorded a dose of 2.77 mSv radiation when the ceiling mounted screen was not used during the first 3 months. The doses were 2.4 to 12.5 times higher in comparison to the measurements that were recorded when the ceiling suspended screen was used. However, a remarkable dose of radiation (ranged between 1.16-0.22 mSv) was received by the operators head despite the use of ceiling mounted screen. Yet, even without the protection of the ceiling mounted screen, the dose recorded by the dosimeter inside the lead cap during the first period was <0.1 mSv. As expected, the doses to the head recorded by the dosimeter inside the cap during the next 15 months period were also less than 0.1 mSv with the use of the ceiling mounted screen. Therefore, a cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless of the use of the screen. Conclusion(s): A cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence was much more protective than the mounted screen and reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless the use of the mounted screen. Although being a subjective conclusion, the operator regularly wearing the lead cap reported that the lead cap is reasonably comfortable and offers an acceptable wearing comfort when used on daily practice.",Excluded
2708,"Impact of prenatal stress on amygdala anatomy in young adulthood: Timing and location matter. BACKGROUND: Exposure to maternal stress in utero has long-term implications for the developing brain and has been linked with a higher risk of depression. The amygdala, which develops during the early embryonic stage and is critical for emotion processing, might be particularly sensitive.METHODS: Using data from a neuroimaging follow-up of the ELSPAC prenatal birth cohort (n=129, 47% men, 23-24 years old), we studied the impact of prenatal stress during the first and second half of pregnancy on the volume of the amygdala and its nuclei in young adult offspring. We further evaluated the relationship between amygdala anatomy and offspring depressive symptomatology. Amygdala nuclei were parcellated using FreeSurfer's automated segmentation pipeline. Depressive symptoms were measured via self-report using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).RESULTS: Exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy was associated with smaller accessory basal (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.27, p(FDR)=0.03) and cortical (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.29, p(FDR)=0.03) nuclei volumes. This effect remained significant after correcting for sex, stress during the second half of pregnancy, as well as maternal age at birth, birth weight, maternal education, and offspring's age at MRI. These two nuclei showed a quadratic relationship with BDI scores in young adulthood, where both smaller and larger volume was associated with more depressive symptoms (Accessory basal nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.05. p(FDR)=0.015; Cortical nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.04, p(FDR)=0.015).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy might have long-term implications for amygdala anatomy, which may in turn predict the experience of depressive symptoms in young adulthood.",Excluded
550,"[OA109] Validation of a radio-guided surgery technique based on beta-radiation: Test on ex-vivo specimens. Purpose: A very promising technique for radio-guided surgery (RGS) based on beta-radiation is being developed. The lower background, with respect to the established approach with high penetrant gamma radiation, can allow for a large diffusion of such a technique and extending the RGS to cases with a large uptake of surrounding healthy organs, such as abdominal and brain neoplastic disease or tumor of infancy. Method(s): To validate the beta-RGS feasibility study, tests on ex-vivo specimens of brain meningioma and gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been performed. These clinical cases were selected between the tumors known to express receptors to a beta-emitting radio-tracer already in use in the clinical routine: <sup>90</sup>Y-labelled DOTATOC. Voluntary patients were enrolled according to the standard uptake value (SUV) and the expected tumor-to-non-tumor ratios (TNR) estimated from PET/CT images after administration of 68 Ga-DOTATOC. All of them gave written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial, already approved by the Ethics Committee. After administration of a low activity (about 2.5 mCi) of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, the extracted ex-vivo specimens and the healthy tissue around the lesions were examined to assess the correlation between the counting rates measured by the developed beta-detecting probe and the expected 90Y activity. Result(s): All the neoplastic samples were correctly identified. A dependence of the counting rate both on the volume V and on the total activity of the sample were observed. Even injecting as low as 1.4 MBq/kg of radio-tracer, tumor remnants of 0.1 ml would be detectable in few seconds. Conclusion(s): The results of the clinical tests showed the validity of the underlying assumptions and strengthening the feasibility studies already published. Small radiopharmaceutical activity is required to detect a tumor remnant as expected due to the low background rates. The negligible medical staff exposure was also confirmed.

Methods: A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of thymoquinone and caffeic acid phenethyl ester administered by intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Results: While liver tissue total oxidant status, lipid hydroperoxide level, and oxidative stress index were significantly increased in the irradiated (IR) group, compared with other groups, total antioxidant status, sulfhydryl levels, and paraoxonase (PON) activity were significantly decreased. Ceruloplasmin activity in IR plus TQ and IR groups was higher than the control group. Arylesterase and PON activities in IR plus TQ- and IR plus CAPE-supplemented groups were lower than those of control groups. Conclusions: TQ and CAPE decrease oxidative stress markers and have antioxidant effects, which also augment antioxidant capacity in the liver tissue of irradiated rats.

PURPOSE: Neurotoxic effects of brain irradiation include cognitive impairment in 50% to 90% of patients. Prior studies have suggested that donepezil, a neurotransmitter modulator, may improve cognitive function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 198 adult brain tumor survivors >= 6 months after partial- or whole-brain irradiation were randomly assigned to receive a single daily dose (5 mg for 6 weeks, 10 mg for 18 weeks) of donepezil or placebo. A cognitive test battery assessing memory, attention, language, visuomotor, verbal fluency, and executive functions was administered before random assignment and at 12 and 24 weeks. A cognitive composite score (primary outcome) and individual cognitive domains were evaluated.RESULTS: Of this mostly middle-age, married, non-Hispanic white sample, 66% had primary brain tumors, 27% had brain metastases, and 8% underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation. After 24 weeks of treatment, the composite scores did not differ significantly between groups (P = .48); however, significant differences favoring donepezil were observed for memory (recognition, P = .027; discrimination, P = .007) and motor speed and dexterity (P = .016). Significant interactions between pretreatment cognitive function and treatment were found for cognitive composite (P = .01), immediate recall (P = .05), delayed recall (P = .004), attention (P = .01), visuomotor skills (P = .02), and motor speed and dexterity (P < .001), with the benefits of donepezil greater for those who were more cognitively impaired before study treatment.CONCLUSION: Treatment with donepezil did not significantly improve the overall composite score, but it did result in modest improvements in several cognitive functions, especially among patients with greater pretreatment impairments.",Excluded

Much of the variation in inherited risk of glioma is likely to be explained by combinations of common low risk variants. The established relationship between glioma risk and exposure to ionizing radiation led us to examine whether variants in the DNA repair genes contribute to disease susceptibility. We evaluated 1127 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) supplemented with 388 putative functional SNPs to capture most of the common variation in 136 DNA repair genes, in five unique case-control series from four different countries (1013 cases, 1016 controls). We identified 16 SNPs associated with glioma risk at the 1% significance level. The highest association observed across the five independent case-control datasets involved rs243356, which maps to intron 3 of CHAF1A (trend odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.54; P = 0.0002; false-positive report probability = 0.055, based on a prior probability of 0.01).

All patients had limited stage disease and received combination chemotherapy consisting of either cisplatin or carboplatin with ifosfamide, etoposide, and vincristine (VICE). Cranial irradiation was administered 48 h after the first cycle of chemotherapy and was well tolerated. Actual 2-year survival was 35% and cranial relapse occurred in 22% of those patients who achieved complete remission. This compares favourably with a cranial relapse rate of 45% incomplete remitters previously reported with the same chemotherapy regime after a minimum follow-up of 2 years where PCI was not used. Formal psychometric testing was performed retrospectively on a series of 25 long-term survivors of whom 14 were taken from this reported series. Whilst 75% of patients were impaired on at least one test with 68% performing badly in the most complex task, this was not associated with clinically detectable neurological damage and the patients did not complain of memory or concentration difficulties. In conclusion, single fraction PCI, when used with platinum based combination chemotherapy, appears to be equally effective but may be less neurotoxic than the more standard fractionated regimes.",Excluded

3034,"Lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR): dosimetric considerations for chest wall toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate chest wall pain in patients with peripheral early stage lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and to identify factors predictive of Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events Grade 2 + chest wall pain.METHODS: Patients who received 55 Gy in five fractions were included. A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded
3791,"Radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases based on a fast, three-dimensional MR imaging technique. A fast, three-dimensional (3D) sequence for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and its application in radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases is reported. The measuring sequence (MPRAGE) requires magnetization-prepared 180degree inversion pulses followed by rapid low angle excitation pulses and gradient-echoes for image generation. The resulting T<inf>1</inf>-weighted MPRAGE images were compared with two-dimensional (2D) T<inf>1</inf>- weighted spin-echo (SE) images after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. Gd- DTPA in 10 patients with known brain metastases. Original or multiplanar reformatted images obtained from a 128 partition data set of the 3D MPRAGE sequence offered comparable diagnostic quality to that of 2D SE imaging. Gd- DTPA enhancement and lesion targeting was similar in most of the patients in SE as well as MPRAGE imaging. During imaging and therapy the patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the MR and the linear accelerator installations. The dose calculation of the radiosurgery planning was based on 3D MR imaging data assuming a homogenous attenuation value inside the head which was sufficient for an accurate dose calculation since tissue inhomogeneities do not significantly influence the shape of the relative dose distribution especially for radiosurgery of the brain. Under this circumstance the dose calculation can be based only on the 3D geometric conformation of the patient's head. A simple algorithm for treatment planning can be used if the MR data are free of geometric distortion. Target point definition, external head contour, and critical structures could be precisely defined in 3D MPRAGE images offering important advantages (i.e., improved spatial resolution, reformatted image reconstruction, rapid 3D imaging and short examination time under mask fixation resulting in better patient comfort, better slice profile, reduced vascular pulsation artefacts, superior and variable choice of soft tissue contrast due to centric phase-encoding order, lower specific absorption rate) over conventional 2D SE imaging. In addition, target volume, calculated dose distribution, and critical structures can be displayed as 3D shaded structures for better assessment for matching of target volume and dose distribution. These findings, along with other advantages of 3D imaging, indicate that the MPRAGE sequence may provide an alternative to T<inf>1</inf>-weighted 2D SE imaging in the radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases.",Excluded

The clinical signs of the rarely encountered ocular neuromyotonia consist of transient involuntary tonic contraction and delayed relaxation of single or multiple extraocular muscles, resulting in episodic diplopia. With a mean time delay of 3.5 years, this motility disorder frequently follows tumor excision or adjuvant radiation near the skull base. Ocular neuromyotonia may reflect inappropriate discharge from oculomotor neurons with unstable cell membranes because of segmental demyelinization by tumor compression and radiation-induced microangiopathy.

3522,"A prospective evaluation of the effects of chronic proton pump inhibitor use on plasma biomarker levels in humans. Introduction: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used primarily to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPI-induced achlorhydria increases circulating gastrin and chromogranin A (CGA). CGA is a widely used biomarker for the diagnosis and follow-up for gut-based neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). PPI-induced increases in CGA or gastrin may falsely suggest the presence of a NET when none exists. Pancreastatin, a fragment of CGA, is also commonly used to diagnose and follow NETs. Aim(s): We hypothesized that chronic PPI use would increase circulating plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin levels. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients who used PPIs for six months or more (mean duration 3.1 +/-2.5 years) and a separate control group of thirty patients who never used antacid medications were prospectively evaluated with plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin determinations. Result(s): Chronic PPI use resulted in significant increases in CGA (15.1+/-11 vs. 131+/-207 ng/ml, p=0.005) and significant increases in gastrin (34.8+/-22.3 vs. 167.8+/-136.2 pg/ml, p=0.001) compared to controls. In contrast, pancreastatin level in non-users and chronic PPI users were identical (81.6+/-36.4 vs.89.4+/-43.4 pg/ml, p=0.46). Conclusion(s): Pancreastatin levels do not change with chronic PPI use and normal pancreastatin levels may be used to distinguish between druginduced changes in biomarkers and tumor-related increases in circulating biomarkers.",Excluded
3440,"Cone beam computed tomography number errors and consequences for radiotherapy planning: An investigation of correction methods. Purpose: The potential of keV cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for guiding adaptive replanning is well-known. There are impediments to this, one being CBCT number accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate CBCT number correction methods and the affect of residual inaccuracies on dose deposition. Four different correction strategies were applied to the same patient data to compare performance and the sophistication of correction-method needed for acceptable dose errors. Methods and Materials: Planning CT and CBCT reconstructions were used for 12 patients (6 brain, 3 prostate, and 3 bladder cancer patients). All patients were treated using Elekta linear accelerators and XVI imaging systems. Two of the CBCT number correction methods investigated were based on an algorithm previously proposed by the authors but only previously applied to phantoms. Two further methods, based on an approach previously suggested in the research literature, were also examined. Dose calculations were performed using scans of a ""worst"" subset of patients using the Pinnacle<sup>3</sup> version 9.0 treatment planning system and the patients' clinical plans. Result(s): All mean errors in CBCT number were <50 HU, and all correction methods performed well or adequately in dose calculations. The worst single dose discrepancy identified for any of the examined methods or patients was 3.0%. Mean errors in the doses to treatment volumes or organs at risk were negatively correlated with the mean error in CT number. That is, a mean CT number that was too large, averaged over the entire CBCT volume, implied an underdosing in a volume-of-interest and vice versa. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that (1) the correction of CBCT numbers to within a mean error of 50 HU in the scan volume provides acceptable discrepancies in dose (<3%) and (2) this is achievable with even quite unsophisticated correction methods. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

2964,"The degree of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks is altered by acute sleep deprivation and psychological stress and is associated with cognitive performance in humans. Study Objectives: Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired immune responses, cancer, and morbidity and mortality, and can degrade cognitive performance, although individual differences exist in such responses. Sleep deprivation induces DNA strand breaks and DNA base oxidation in animals, and psychological stress is associated with increased DNA damage in humans. It remains unknown whether sleep deprivation or psychological stress in humans affects DNA damage response from environmental stressors, and whether these responses predict cognitive performance during sleep deprivation.Methods: Sixteen healthy adults (ages 29-52 years; mean age +/- SD, 36.4 +/- 7.1 years; seven women) participated in a 5-day experiment involving two 8 hr time-in-bed (TIB) baseline nights, followed by 39 hr total sleep deprivation (TSD), and two 8-10 hr TIB recovery nights. A modified Trier Social Stress Test was conducted on the day after TSD. The Psychomotor Vigilance Test measured behavioral attention. DNA damage was assessed in blood cells collected at 5 time points, and blood cells were irradiated ex vivo.Results: TSD, alone or in combination with psychological stress, did not induce significant increases in DNA damage. By contrast, radiation-induced DNA damage decreased significantly in response to TSD, but increased back to baseline when combined with psychological stress. Cognitively vulnerable individuals had more radiation-induced DNA strand breaks before TSD, indicating their greater sensitivity to DNA damage from environmental stressors.Conclusions: Our results provide novel insights into the molecular consequences of sleep deprivation, psychological stress, and performance vulnerability. They are important for fields involving sleep loss, radiation exposure, and cognitive deficits, including cancer therapy, environmental toxicology, and space medicine.",Excluded

The ALK-EML4 rearrangement in NSCLC creates a recognized oncogenic driver with high response rates to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib. The characteristics of CNS metastases and their response to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NCSLC is unknown.We reviewed NSCLC patients with florescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) positive ALK rearrangement and CNS metastases at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 29 patients (11 men, 38%) were identified, with a median age at initial CNS diagnosis of 50 (range 25-80). Brain metastases developed a median of 11 months (IQR 0.3-22) afterNSCLCdiagnosis, and were present at the initial cancer diagnosis in 10 (34%). 10 patients (34%) had > 4 brain lesions at initial CNS diagnosis. Median initial Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score at diagnosis of brain metastases was 80% (range 60-100). Leptomeningeal metastases developed following brain metastases in 6 patients (21%), at a median of 27 (range 20-82) months fromcancer diagnosis. Initial CNS-directed treatment included chemotherapy in 10 (34%), radiation followed by chemotherapy or TKI in 10 (34%), radiation only in 5 (17%), surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation in 3 (10%), and palliative care in 1. Median time to CNS progression from initial CNS therapy was 7.2 months (IQR 5.8-29.8mo). With a median follow-up of 17 months, median OS from diagnosis of brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease were 38 months and 105 days, respectively. In 17 patients who received crizotinib after diagnosis of CNS disease, partial response (PR), stable disease and progression were noted in 7 (41%), 5 (29%) and 5 respectively; however only 2 patients withPRreceived crizotinib without closely sequential chemotherapy or radiation. Median CNS PFS from crizotinib initiation in the 17 evaluable patients was 5.8 months (IQR 3.7-9.7mo). Survival with brain metastasis in ALK-rearranged NSCLC may be prolonged with selected therapy, and crizotinib may have therapeutic activity.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is a biomarker for the viability of brain tissue in ischemic stroke. However, acquisition of the OEF map using positron emission tomography (PET) with oxygen-15 gas is uncomfortable for patients because of the long fixation time, invasive arterial sampling, and radiation exposure. We aimed to predict the OEF map from magnetic resonance (MR) and PET images using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and to demonstrate which PET and MR images are optimal as inputs for the prediction of OEF maps.METHODS: Cerebral blood flow at rest (CBF) and during stress (sCBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps acquired from oxygen-15 PET, and routine MR images (T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted images) for 113 patients with steno-occlusive disease were learned with U-Net. MR and PET images acquired from the other 25 patients were used as test data. We compared the predicted OEF maps and intraclass correlation (ICC) with the real OEF values among combinations of MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF.RESULTS: Among the combinations of input images, OEF maps predicted by the model learned with MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF maps were the most similar to the real OEF maps (ICC: 0.597 +/- 0.082). However, the contrast of predicted OEF maps was lower than that of real OEF maps.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the deep CNN learned useful features from CBF, sCBF, CBV, and MR images and predict qualitatively realistic OEF maps. These findings suggest that the deep CNN model can shorten the fixation time for <sup>15</sup>O PET by skipping <sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub> scans. Further training with a larger data set is required to predict accurate OEF maps quantitatively.",Excluded

2443,"The source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the goldfish: a differential irradiation protocol. We have used a partial irradiation paradigm to examine the provenance of cells that participate in Wallerian cellular responses in the goldfish visual system. Animals which received 50 Gy whole-body gamma-irradiation showed virtually complete inhibition of the proliferative burst usually seen after optic nerve section. These animals did, however, show a robust hyperplastic response in the optic tract that we believe represents the migration of nearby microglial cells into the affected tract. When only the postcephalic body was irradiated, proliferating cells in the major hematopoietic organs of the fish, the kidney and pronephros, were substantially inhibited. Despite this, the Wallerian cellular response in the visual paths was essentially normal. Thus, there is no obligate requirement for peripheral proliferative cells to participate in central Wallerian degeneration in the fish. However, when only the head was irradiated, and the hematopoietic organs were spared, there was a proliferative response in the visual system. We believe this represents the invasion of the visual pathways by peripheral blood cells through the optic nerve lesion and blood vessels in the nerve itself. This invasion, however, is not sufficient to generate substantial hyperplasia. In summary, although we find evidence for a small contribution by exogenous cells, the major source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the fish is the endogenous microglia. Our data underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanisms by which microglial cells are activated and the role that they play in regeneration.",Included

BACKGROUND: The impact of patient body mass index (BMI) on image-guided spine interventions remains unknown. Higher BMI is known to complicate the acquisition of radiographic images. Therefore it can be hypothesized that the patient's body habitus can influence the delivery of a spinal injection.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of patient BMI on the length of fluoroscopy and procedure times during spine interventions.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 2 prospective observational studies.SETTING: All injections were performed in an outpatient university setting.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 209 patients in whom spine injections were performed (99 women), with a mean age of 54.6 years.METHODS: The fluoroscopy times for 202 participants and total procedure times for 137 participants were recorded. Additional participant characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, and actual procedures performed, also were collected. Analysis of covariance and linear and nonlinear model analysis were performed to assess the effect of BMI on fluoroscopy and procedure times.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fluoroscopy time and procedure duration times.RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 54.6 years, 51% were men, and 77% (n = 155) were overweight (BMI >=25). Participants received the following interventions: 40 zygapophyseal joint injections, 33 medial branch nerve blocks, 113 transforaminal epidural injections, and 16 combined zygapophyseal joint injections and epidural injections. Gender, procedure number, and procedure type did not differ between groups. The overweight group demonstrated a 30% increase in mean fluoroscopy time and a 35% increase in mean procedure time. Controlling for other variables, we found that differences in fluoroscopy time and procedure time were significant (P = .032 and P = .031, respectively) between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopy time in overweight patients increase the risks associated with spine interventions, not only to the patients but also to the operating room staff exposed to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Radiation-induced optic neuropathy is a rare complication (prevalence less than 1%) following radiotherapy of the sellar region. However, the vasculopathy in Cushing's disease predisposes to radiation-induced injury. We report the case of a 24-year-old man with Cushing's disease since he was 16. The hormonal study including bilateral inferior petrosal sinus catheterization diagnosed a pituitary right lesion, but imagiology was always negative. He underwent a transsphenoidal microadenomectomy and the pathological study showed the presence of corticotrophic hyperplasia but no adenoma. Secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism as well as permanent diabetes insipidus were diagnosed and because the patient was not cured he underwent a second transsphenoidal total hypophysectomy. After that and because he was still hypercortisolemic, pituitary external irradiation was given in a total dose of 6000 rad. Six months later he developed progressive bilateral visual loss.

1628,"Normal tissue contour variation and the dosimetric impact on radiation therapy treatment planning. Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate how variability in contouring normal tissues affects dose assessment for radiation therapy treatment planning. Materials/Methods: Computed tomography (CT) scans of individual patients treated for tumors of the brain, head and neck, thorax, pancreas and prostate were selected for this study. For each scan, a radiation oncologist, who primarily treats the disease site and a diagnostic radiologist, outlined the normal tissues (""gold"" contours) using RTOG guidelines. A total of 27 organs were delineated. Independently, five board-certified dosimetrists and one trainee then outlined the same set of contours on the individual scans. A radiation treatment plan was calculated for each of the disease sites based on PTVs, gold contours and doses defined by the physician. Dose-volume constraints were defined per RTOG protocol criteria for each disease site. Result(s): For the 27 gold organs contoured, a total of 156 organs were outlined by dosimetrists. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for each dosimetrist drawn organ and compared with the gold contours. Of the 34 dosimetric endpoints that were evaluated, 56% of the organs had dosimetric parameters that agreed to within 10% of those obtained by the gold contours. Maximum and mean dose variation for the dosimetrist's contours that were greater than 10% when compared to the dose of the gold contours were reviewed. Organs with the highest variation in dose were the optic lens maximum dose (45%) and the mandible maximum dose (40%). Moderate variation was seen for the mean left parotid gland dose (15%) and the cervical spinal cord (13%). When evaluating the prostate plan, the V80Gy, V75Gy and V65Gy for the bladder and the V70Gy and V50Gy for the rectum were obtained. Minimal variation was observed in the absolute volumes at each dose level, however the relative variation was larger (10-25%). This difference is due to the small volume of the organs receiving these doses and was determined not to be clinically relevant. Conclusion(s): The results of this study demonstrated that the normal tissue contours produced by our dosimetrists showed good dosimetric agreement with the gold contours for over half of the organs evaluated. For the remaining organs, our expectation is that the establishment of contouring competencies will ensure more accurate treatments and dose assessment in radiotherapy treatment planning and delivery.",Excluded

AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the inhibitory effects of Tanshinone II(A) on the production of proinflammation cytokines in radiation-stimulated microglia.METHODS: Microglia cells were treated with 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Gy of irradiation or sham-irradiated in the presence or absence of 1.0 microg/mL of Tanshinone II(A). The effects of Tanshinone II(A) on radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction; the expression level of nuclear factor (NF-kappabeta) p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus was measured by Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy analysis were applied to detect the expression of gamma-H2AX and p65 postirradiation.RESULTS: Radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells was detectable after irradiation. Tanshinone II(A) decreased the radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines. Further, Western blotting showed that Tanshinone II(A) could attenuate the nuclear translocation of (NF-kappabeta) p65 submit postirradiation. Immunofluorescence staining showed gamma-H2AX foci formation with p65 translocation into the nucleus postirradiation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that Tanshinone II(A) exerts anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes that might be associated with the NF-kappabeta signaling pathway. It is postulated that irradiation causes immediate cellular reaction, and that double-strand breaks trigger the molecular response that leads to NF-kappabeta pathway activation.",Included
1551,"Effects on the nervous system by exposure to electromagnetic fields: experimental and clinical studies. Exposure to electromagnetic fields may cause various types of effects on nervous tissue, in severe cases even irreversible damage. The exposure conditions, i.e. frequency including type and extent of modulation, time, intensity, wave form, as well as shape, size and position of exposed subject and possible treatment with drugs, are factors determining if damage, acute or chronic, ultimately result. Long term exposure of newborn rabbits, rats and mice to electromagnetic fields of power frequency (10-14 kV/m; 50 or 60 Hz; sinusoidal wave form; 21-24 h per day) may cause affection and even damage to the nervous system. Large nerve cells showed reactive changes such as lamellar bodies and cytoskeletal alteration to an extent varying with exposure conditions. Reactive neuroglial changes as well as increase in neuroglial marker proteins could concomitantly be demonstrated. The changes seemed to be reversible although we only have incomplete data available. Exposure in vitro of frog sciatic nerve to 16-60 Hz sinusoidal low current (50-1000 nA) for 17 h induced cytoskeletal changes. Exposure of rabbits to pulsed microwaves of moderate to high intensity (3.1 GHz; 300 Hz modulation; peak duration 1.4 usec with maximal peak intensity about 1000 times average; 55 mW/cm; SAR in the brain cortex about 20 W/kg; increase of temperature as measured by lightguide-equipped instruments in right brain hemisphere about 1-2 degrees C) during 1 h per day during three days resulted in no obvious initial changes in behaviour. Minimal acute dam- age could be demonstrated. However, after two to four months and later on both structural, immunohistochemical and biochemical changes could be documented. Radar technicians accidently and/or occupationally exposed to microwaves showed psychoneurological signs of affection as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid protein pattern. No related changes have been noticed among matched controls. Exposure of nervous tissue to electromagnetic fields ranging from power frequency to microwaves may thus exert a wide range of effects, mostly by mechanisms we know little about.",Excluded
1462,"Differential radiosensitivity of neurons and neuroglia of the hippocampus in the adult rabbit. Adult rabbits were subjected to 4.5 Gy of whole-blody or brain alone gamma-irradiation, and their hippocampus was examined with the light and electron microscope. Pycnotic cells were found at the base of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in the so-called subgranular zone, as soon as 3 h after irradiation, and were cleared up by active phagocytosis after 48 h. Some of these cells appeared as undifferentiated, whereas others were differentiating granule cells, and possibly immature neuroglia. The extent of cell necrosis was contingent upon the age of the animal, the oldest animal studied (27 months) showing only sparse lesion of that type. Astrocytes and microglia were responsible for the phagocytosis of dead cells. Another type of lesion was found in the nuclei of the mature granule cells and consisted of light spots which appeared 1 h after the irradiation and disappeared almost completely after 48 h. Pyramidal cells did not show any of these two lesions. It is concluded that the laterations in the electrical activity of pyrimidal cells, following irradiation, are at least partly due to lesions affecting the dentate gyrus. Radionecrosis in the subgranular zone is related to the presence of immature cells in this region.",Included

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is currently widely used in the treatment of patients with lung cancer, but despite that the data on alopecia after this type of treatment are limited. Aim. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing the duration of alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. Material and methods. Two groups of patients were analyzed: group I - 34 patients radically treated fornon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and group II - 18 patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In group I 12 patients were treated with radiotherapy only, the remaining patients were treated with neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin + vinorelbin: PN or cisplatin + gemcitabin: PG) in 2 to 6 cycles. PCI was administered during the last tree weeks of thoracic irradiation or >=2 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy and consisted of 15 fractions of 2 Gy per day (30 Gy), 5 days per week. Patients from group II received 25 Gy in 10 fractions starting from the second week of thoracic irradiation; chemotherapy (cisplatin + vepesid: PE every 21 days) started concurrently with thoracic irradiation. Results. Alopecia occurred in all patients treated with PCI; hair loss began 2-3 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In group I full re-growth of hair occurred in 33 patients, one patient died during treatment, before hair re-growth had the chance to take place. Time to re-growth (TRG) was 1.5-6 months, median 2.5 months. In this group we observed a trend towards longer re-growths in patients who had received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.07).

2591,"Estimation of a minimum yearly radiation allowance (MYRA). Considerable evidence indicates that ionizing radiation is an essential agent. When reared in environments with levels of ionizing radiation below that of our background, a variety of species exhibit poor survival or reproduction. In contrast, whole body exposures to low dose irradiation increase most physiologic parameters; these include neuromuscular development, reproduction, cell repair systems, immune competence, and average lifespan. This indicates that we live in a partial deficiency of ionizing radiation. Cancer mortality rate is an important criterion to evaluate the effect of low doses of ionizing radiation. Valuable evidence is available from the deaths of nuclear workers who were exposed to low doses of radiation in energy, weapons and ship building plants. The cancer mortality rate in 120,000 exposed nuclear workers was only 63% that of 200,000 control workers in the same plants. Evidence from 8 million person-years experience indicates that low levels of ionizing radiation are beneficial. The data support the hypothesis that safe supplementation of ionizing radiation should become a public health program. The evidence supports a minimum yearly radiation allowance (MYRA) of 7 centigrey/year (cGy/y) for adult males.",Excluded
326,"Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer with hemorrhagic metastases to the pituitary gland. Objective: To present a case of a patient with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer with hemorrhagic metastases to the pituitary gland who presented with diabetes insipidus (DI). Case Presentation: A 56 year-old man with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer presented with failure to thrive. Eight years prior to admission he underwent a left hemi-thyroidectomy for a compressive goiter with pathology noting a follicular adenoma. Four years later while undergoing routine imaging, multiple lung and bone lesions were identified prompting a bone biopsy with pathology of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer. A complete thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection was performed confirming follicular thyroid cancer. Over the next several years, due to persistent disease confirmed both biochemically and with imaging, the patient received external bean radiation followed by 6 doses RAI totaling over 1200 mCi resulting in pancytopenia, thus precluding the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Five months after his last dose of RAI, the patient presented to our hospital with failure to thrive. Labs included TSH 0.021 mcU/ mL (on levothyroxine), thyroglobulin > 47000 ng/mL (antibody negative). Palliative care was consulted and dexamethasone was started for appetite stimulation. The following month the patient presented with confusion, blurry vision, polydipsia, polyuria with severe nocturia impacting his quality of life. Labs included sodium 140 mEq/L, serum osmolarity 288 mOsm/kg, urine osmolarity 192 mOsm/kg and urine sodium 39 mmol/L. Noncontrast MRI head showed a large mushroom appearing sellar lesion with hemorrhagic supra-sellar component compressing the optic chiasm. Dexamethasone was increased and intranasal DDVAP started for symptomatic relief. Patient was discharged on home hospice and passed away 6 weeks later. Discussion(s): Pituitary metastases, a rare complication of systemic malignancies, most commonly breast and lung cancer, are estimated to be 1-5% of sellar neoplasms, with the most reported presentation being DI (estimated to be 45%). Metastatic thyroid cancers, with an incidence of 10-35%, have a tendency to spread to the lung, followed by bone, brain, liver, and skin with pituitary metastases being extremely rare. In a case series of 22 patients with metastatic thyroid cancer to the pituitary gland, only 5 patients presented with DI out of which only one had follicular thyroid cancer. We present the second case report of a patient with follicular thyroid cancer with metastases to the pituitary who presented with DI.

3360,"ADAM23: Biomarker for nonmelanoma skin cancer disease progression. The ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) comprise a family of multidomain transmembrane and secreted proteins involved in cytokine and growth factor release, proteolysis and cell adhesion. Multiple family members have been shown to play a role in cancer formation and disease progression. Decreased ADAM23 expression has been demonstrated in human breast, colon, gastric, head and neck, brain and pancreatic cancers and is believed to be associated with a more malignant or metastatic phenotype. Substantially more than 1 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) occur annually in the United States according to the American Cancer Society. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the two major types of NMSC and most are related to chronic sun exposure. We have demonstrated by microarray analysis that ADAM23 expression is decreased in human keratinocytes chronically irradiated with a solar-simulated light source. Using a human SCC skin carcinogenesis model, we have demonstrated that decreased ADAM23 expression correlates with disease progression. Preliminary immunohistochemical analysis of human SCC samples also demonstrates decreased ADAM23 expression. We believe that ADAM23 may serve as a biomarker of human skin SCC disease progression. This may be important for earlier detection and for the possible development of targeted therapy that may serve as an alternative to potentially disfiguring surgical treatment.",Excluded
2242,"Is there a correlation between peptide receptor radionuclide therapy-associated hematological toxicity and spleen dose?. AIM: The spleen receives a high mean absorbed radiation dose during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRNT). The aim of this study is to correlate the radiation dose to spleen with the effect on blood cell count after PRRNT.METHODS: Fifty-three neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients were treated with 3.8-8.5 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC. Dosimetry was performed according to MIRD scheme. Eleven NET patients who had undergone splenectomy before PRRNT and who received 4.7-7.6 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC were selected as controls. RBC, WBC (total and differential), and platelet counts before and after each cycle of PRRNT were documented.RESULTS: The median dose to the spleen in the study group was 6.34 Gy (2.32-20.06 Gy). There was no significant difference in the posttherapy changes in the blood cell counts (RBC, WBC, or platelets) between the study group and the control group. Mild hematological toxicity was found in 7 of the 53 (13.2%) patients in the study group and in 1 out of the 11 patients (9.1%) in the control group.

We describe biological evaluation of a novel theranostic agent targeted to microtubules. Methyl N-[5-(3'-[<sup>131</sup>I]iodobenzoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate (1) and methyl N-[5-(3'-[<sup>125</sup>I]iodobenzoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate (2) were synthesized from a common precursor 3'-stannylated derivative (4). Antiproliferative effects and radiotoxicity of <sup>131</sup>I-labeled beta-particle emitting 1 were examined in vitro in human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells lines. The therapeutic potential of 1 was also examined in a subcutaneous mouse model of human glioblastoma U-87 MG. Compound 1 at the extracellular radioactive concentration of 0.35 MBq/mL, easily achievable in vivo, kills >90% of neuroblastoma cells and >60% glioblastoma cells as measured in a clonogenic assay. D<inf>10</inf> doses established for 1 indicate that as few as 3,000 decays are sufficient to kill 90% of BE(2)-C cells. Even U-87 MG cells, the least sensitive of the tested cell lines, require <20,000 decays of intracellular <sup>131</sup>I to reduce number of clonogenic cells by 90%.

Erythropoietin (Epo) had been shown to have a neuroprotective effect independent from its erythropoietic properties. In this study, we tested whether Epo could protect the retina from damage induced by a long period of moderate light insult and how it protected. First, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) by human recombinant Epo at 5000 or 30,000U/kg to assess Epo concentration in plasma and retina. Second, rats were untreated or injected i.p. with Epo at 30,000U/kg, 1 or 4h before being placed in constant light (24h; 2200lux). Electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded before treatment, 1day and 15days (D15) after light exposure. After the last ERG, eyes were taken for histology. In parallel, we tested Epo protection against oxidative stressors on isolated retinas and its effect on caspase-9 activity. Epo injected at 30,000U/kg body weight, 4h before exposure to the damaging light, protected retinal function and structure against light damage and induced an increase in caspase-9 activity and expression. Epo had no direct or indirect protective effect against free radicals-induced death on isolated retinas. Epo protected the retina from a long period of moderate light exposure through a mechanism independent from a free radical scavenging property or an antioxidant facilitating activity. The activation of caspase-9, 4h after Epo injection, corresponding to the start of light exposure, suggests that caspase-9 plays a role in neuroprotection.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Spine stereotactic body radiation therapy (sSBRT) is used to treat relapse following conventional radiation (cEBRT). This study seeks to determine the risk factors for local relapse both radiographically and in regards to pain. Materials/Methods: Patients who underwent sSBRT following cEBRT were included in an IRB-approved database. RPA Class, histology, presence of paraspinal disease, multilevel disease (more than 1 spinal level involved), presence of epidural disease, neural foramina involvement, and dosimetric factors (volume, prescription dose, % coverage by the prescription dose, maximum dose, minimum dose) were retrospectively collected. These factors were correlated to radiographic control and pain progression as determined by the Brief Pain Inventory. Result(s): A total of 79 procedures were performed in 65 patients. Median age was 60 years (range: 27-90). Median follow-up was 8.5 months (range: 0-57.7) and median overall survival was 10.5 months. Median prescription dose was 14 Gy (range: 8-25) typically over 1 fraction (range: 1-10). At presentation, 10.1% were asymptomatic, 6.3% had neurological deficits, 72.2% had pain, and 11.4% had pain and neurological deficits. Following sSBRT, pain control was seen in 81% and 78.5% had radiographic control at last follow-up. Median time to pain relief was 0.7 months (range: 0-3.9). RPA Class, histology, presence of paraspinal disease, multilevel disease, presence of epidural disease, and neural foramina involvement did not predict for radiographic control or pain progression. None of the dosimetric factors predicted for radiographic control or pain progression as well. None of the patients in this series developed myelopathy. New vertebral body fracture developed in 8.9% of treatments. Conclusion(s): sSBRT for progression post cEBRT is effective and safe. Pain relief is quick following sSBRT. Our current standard dose is 16 Gy in 1 fraction. These results are consistent with our data for patients treated upfront for spine metastases.

1146,"The Safety of CT-Guided Epidural Steroid Injections in an Older Patient Cohort. BACKGROUND: Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a common method for treating lower back pain, which is one of the most prevalent health-related complaints in the adult US population. Although the safety of CT-guided ESIs has been extensively studied in adults, there is limited data concerning the procedure's safety profile in an older patient population.OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study analyzed safety data among a single-center cohort of patients > 65 years-old who received one or more CT-guided interlaminar ESIs from 2012 to 2015.STUDY DESIGN: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective chart review.SETTING: University hospital center.METHODS: A total of 688 CT-guided ESI procedures were evaluated and a linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between dose length product (DLP), body mass index (BMI), procedure duration, and kVp/mA settings. Further analysis was performed on a sample of long procedure time, average-DLP and high-DLP procedures.RESULTS: Average age was 75.77 years, with 44% having a BMI > 30. The mean DLP was 55.58 mGy x cm and the mean procedure duration was 5.94 minutes. All procedures were technically successful and no complications were observed during or after any of the procedures, including at one-month follow-up office visits. The kVp and mA settings were the strongest predictors of DLP, followed by procedure time. The high-DLP cases had a greater number of needle placement series, more intervertebral disc spaces included in each planning series and higher machine settings (kVp 120; mA 87.5) than the average-DLP cases (kVp 100; mA 49.9).LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its retrospective design.CONCLUSION: CT-guided interlaminar ESIs can be performed safely, with low procedure times, relatively low DLP's and without complications in an older patient population.

Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4), together with rods and cones, provide light information driving nonvisual light responses. We examined nonvisual photoreception in mice lacking RPE65, a protein that is required for regeneration of visual chromophore in rods and cones. Although Rpe65 knockouts retain a small degree of rod function, we show here that circadian phase shifting responses in Rpe65(-/-) mice are attenuated far beyond what has been reported for rodless/coneless mice. Furthermore, the number of melanopsin-immunoreactive perikarya and the extent of dendritic arborizations were decreased in Rpe65 knockout mice compared with controls. To assess the nature of the photoreceptive defect in Rpe65 null mice, we eliminated either rods or melanopsin from Rpe65(-/-) retinas by generating (i) Rpe65(-/-) mice carrying a transgene (rdta) that results in selective elimination of rods and (ii) double knockout Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, rod loss in Rpe65 knockout mice resulted in restoration of circadian photosensitivity. Normal photoentrainment was lost in Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice, and, instead, a diurnal phenotype was observed. Our findings demonstrate that RPE65 is not required for ipRGC function but reveal the existence of a mechanism whereby rods may influence the function of ipRGCs.",Excluded

The courtship ritual of male Drosophila represents an innate behaviour that is initiated by female-derived sensory stimuli.

Namely, stimulation of the pC1 neuronal cluster initiates unilateral wing extension and vibration of both sides, whereas stimulation of the pC2l cluster initiates only contralateral wing displays. In addition, stimulation of pC2l but not pC1 neurons induced abdominal bending and proboscis extension. Ca(2+) imaging of the pC1 cluster revealed periodic Ca(2+) rises, each corresponding to a turn of the male fly during courtship. In contrast, group-reared fru mutant males exhibit light spot-induced courtship pursuit without optogenetic priming.

The hormonal status and age of an animal at the time of exposure affect the severity of light-induced retinal damage. The adrenal axis and pituitary hormones (prolactin) have been demonstrated previously to affect the degree of cell death in the retina. Because circadian rhythms for adrenal and pituitary secretion have been demonstrated in the rat, a series of experiments was undertaken to determine if a diurnal pattern of retinal susceptibility to light damage exists which might be related to endogenous endocrine rhythms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 4 hr of high intensity fluorescent light for 8 consecutive days during different phases of the 14:10 hr light: dark animal room light cycle. Morphometric analysis performed at the light microscopic level 2 weeks after exposure demonstrated a differential susceptibility to light-induced cell death depending upon the period during the light-dark cycle when animals received their daily light exposure. Neuronal cell death was confined to the outer nuclear layer as previously described. The retinas of animals exposed during the middle of the dark period or during the first 5 hr of the light period were significantly more damaged than the retinas of animals exposed during the last 9 hr of the light period. Control groups for the relative amounts of dark-adaptation between groups suggested that the diurnal susceptibility to light damage was not solely dependent upon the degree of dark adaptation.

285,"Space-clamp problems when voltage clamping neurons expressing voltage-gated conductances. The voltage-clamp technique is applicable only to spherical cells. In nonspherical cells, such as neurons, the membrane potential is not clamped distal to the voltage-clamp electrode. This means that the current recorded by the voltage-clamp electrode is the sum of the local current and of axial currents from locations experiencing different membrane potentials. Furthermore, voltage-gated currents recorded from a nonspherical cell are, by definition, severely distorted due to the lack of space clamp. Justifications for voltage clamping in nonspherical cells are, first, that the lack of space clamp is not severe in neurons with short dendrites. Second, passive cable theory may be invoked to justify application of voltage clamp to branching neurons, suggesting that the potential decay is sufficiently shallow to allow spatial clamping of the neuron. Here, using numerical simulations, we show that the distortions of voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents are substantial even in neurons with short dendrites. The simulations also demonstrate that passive cable theory cannot be used to justify voltage clamping of neurons due to significant shunting to the reversal potential of the voltage-gated conductance during channel activation. Some of the predictions made by the simulations were verified using somatic and dendritic voltage-clamp experiments in rat somatosensory cortex. Our results demonstrate that voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents recorded from branching neurons are almost always severely distorted.",Excluded

Method(s): We report a case of anaplastic oligodendroglioma metastatic to bone with a dramatic and durable response to temozolomide therapy. A retrospective case review, molecular analysis, and literature search were performed. Result(s): The patient presented with a right frontal mass in 1990. Progression led to resection of the lesion in 1995. Histology revealed an anaplastic oligodendroglioma and the tumour was found to have allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 1p (1p-). He received standard radiation therapy. In 2000 he developed hip and pelvic pain. A bone scan showed multiple skeletal lesions.

Up to six gold markers were transurethrally implanted into the bladder wall around the tumor bed after the transurethral tumor reduction and 40-Gy pelvic irradiation. After the manual setup using skin marks, the coordinates of the center of gravity of fiducial markers were measured at the start of treatment and during irradiation. The table position was adjusted to the planned position if the discrepancy was larger than 2.0 mm along the cranial-caudal (CC), left-right (LR), or anterior-posterior (AP) direction. Using the position at the start of radiation dose delivery as the reference position, we analyzed the interfractional setup error and intrafractional error due to bladder motion. Result(s): The overall number of sessions in which table adjustments were required was 108 (71.5%) for pretreatment offsets and 38 (25.2%) for offsets after the initiation of radiation therapy. The number of table adjustments in a session ranged from 0 to 4, and more than two adjustments were required in 7 sessions involving 5 patients. To guarantee that 90% of patients in the population receive a minimum cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) dose of at least 95% of the prescribed dose, the setup margin (SM) was 14.5 mm, 9.6 mm, and 10.6 mm along the CC, LR, and AP directions, respectively. The internal margin (IM) calculated from offsets at the end of irradiation was 2.6 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.1 mm, and number of sessions in which the length of required table adjustment was greater than the calculated IM after the initial setup was 12 (7.9%), 14 (9.3%), and 17 (11.3%), and the average time interval (range, standard deviation) between the initiation of radiation therapy and the table adjustment greater than the calculated IM was 4.2 (0.2-15.0, 5.2) minutes, 5.6 (0.2-14.7, 5.0) minutes, 4.4 (0.2-14.7, 3.9) minutes along these directions, respectively.

3161,"Metabolic correction of cerebral radiation syndrome. DNA strand breaks that occur after irradiation activate the repair enzyme adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase, which consumes NAD as a substrate and causes depletion first of neuronal NAD and then of the ATP pool. This is considered to be the crucial link in the mechanism underlying the cerebral radiation syndrome (CRS). In this study, two ways to correct the CRS metabolically were examined: (a) prevention of depletion of NAD after irradiation by administration of the enzyme inhibitor nicotinamide and (b) shunting the NAD-dependent oxidative phosphorylation pathway of ATP resynthesis by administration of a substrate of NAD-independent oxidation, succinate. Cerebral lesions induced by radiation were modeled by irradiation of rats or rat brain homogenates with 150 Gy of X rays. The manifestations of CRS in rats (excitement, convulsions, etc.) closely resembled those seen after acute hypoxia. In brain homogenates, pyruvate tetrazolium-reductase activity decreased after irradiation and could be corrected by addition of NAD after irradiation. Succinate tetrazolium-reductase activity was not affected by irradiation. Oxygen consumption by brain homogenates after irradiation in vitro and in situ decreased, as did oxygen consumption by rats in vivo after cranio-caudal irradiation. Administration of nicotinamide or succinate prevented both the postirradiation decrease in respiration (in both rats in vivo and brain homogenates in vitro) and the development of cerebral radiation syndrome. These results help to clarify the mechanisms underlying CRS and its metabolic correction.",Included

According to these recommendations as adjuvant chemotherapy for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cisplatin doblets are used (etoposide/vinorelbine, gemcitabine) or paclitaxel/carboplatin. For the first-line treatment in advanced and metastatic NSCLC standard regimen is cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with the gemcitabine/etoposide/vinorelbine or paclitaxel. In EGFR mutated patients gefitinib or erlotinib are the first options. In some clinical studies bevacizumab is used in the first line as well as erlotinib single. For the second-line treatment docetaxel/cisplatin is in standard use and erlotinib single in patients who had haematological side effects in the first line chemotherapy. Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is standard treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma. In SCLC patients cisplatin/etoposide is first line treatment. Depends on disease-free survival as the second-line chemotherapy cisplatin/ etoposide or topotecan are protocols could be applied.

Purpose: PRRT is a known tool in the management of patients with disseminated and inoperable NETs. The aim of study was to assess the effectiveness of the repeated cycles of PRRT in patients with disseminated and inoperable NETs. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty nine patients were included in the PRRT. Among them 16 patients (18%) were qualified for a repeated PRRT cycle due to progression of the disease. In one of the patients qualified for the repeated cycle, PRRT was used as neoadjuvant therapy. The results and side-effects of the repeated cycles of PRRT were analyzed. Result(s): Disease stabilization was observed in 10 patients 6 months after the repeated PRRT cycle and in 5 patients after 12 and 18 months. Ten of the patients who had received repeated PRRT cycles died. In the case of neoadjuvant therapy, further reduction of the tumor size was observed, enabling qualification for surgery. Clinically significant reduction in the mean values of morphological parameters was not observed. Only after 12 and 18 months the mean values of creatinine levels were higher than the normal range (only in 2 patients). Conclusion(s): The repeated cycles of PRRT did not cause a clinically significant increase of the toxicity of PRRT. The changes in kidney and blood morphology parameters were transient. The repeated cycles of PRRT enabled stabilization of the disease. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

To understand the technique and results of IRE No abstract available. Special Session Intraprocedural radiation dose management 103.1 Occupational dosimetry in the interventional laboratory: dose limits and risk estimation G. Bartal Radiology, Meir MC, Kfar-Saba, Israel Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the potential risks of occupational radiation exposure 2. To learn about the dose limits for different organs and acceptable dose 3. To learn how to estimate the risks As more evidence is emerging from recent publications on the dangers of occupational radiation exposure in Image (Fluoroscopy) guided interventions there is a clear need to recognize the risks, to learn about staff dose limits and the ways to reduce the possible damage to a Minimum. Recent publications confirm the alarming incidence and variety of occupational-related illnesses of medical staff working in the interventional laboratory (1, 2, 3). International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) issued a new recommendation for the occupational dose limit to the lens of the eye based on the new threshold for lens effects and the suggested equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye was reduced from 150mSv year-1 (ICRP 2013 Proceedings) to 20mSv year-1, averaged over a 5-year period, with no year's dose exceeding 50mSv (ICRP, 2012). Last International and European BSS (Basic Safety Standards) comprises new limit (European Commission, 2012; IAEA, 2014) for the medical staff (1). Relatively high exposure doses have been reported for both extremities (2) and the eye lens (3, 4) of the Interventional Radiologists (IRs) that in some cases, exceed the personal dose limits. Moreover, new controlled data suggest lower or even no dose threshold for radiation- induced eye lens injuries. These data are under consideration by the ICRP and may lead to the re-evaluation of the existing dose limit (1). There is no ""acceptable dose"" definition or recommendation for the personnel, as it depends on the specific applications and is different for public, workers and patients. There are dose limits for the personnel, which are not applicable to the medical exposure of patients. Noticeably, new dose thresholds, particularly the 0.5 Gy threshold for the lens of the eye, affect occupational protection for operators and other staff, which is principally important for fluoroscopically guided procedures (1, 6). Regrettably, not all operators protect their eyes or their brain sufficiently during interventions. After several years of work without proper protection, cumulative absorbed doses to the lens can exceed 0.5 Gy [ RELID (Retrospective Evaluation of Lens Injuries and Dose) (see: https://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/ news/relid-cataract-study.htm)]. During most of the IAEA surveys of radiation-related lens opacities in interventionalists and staff, 40-50% of the professionals involved in interventional cardiology procedures who volunteered to be examined had posterior subcapsular lens opacities (2, 3, 4). Only 10% of the members of the control groups had such opacities. Important to note that most of the observed lens opacities were in interventionists who had worked for several years without any eye protection. The dose rate to the operator can exceed 10 mSv h-1 when the 'high-dose' fluoroscopy mode is used and 50 mSv h-1 during cine acquisition. The highest dose rate was recorded at the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO 90) projection, which corresponds to the lateral projection when the operator is standing at the tube side (4, 5). Many medical specialties outside the imaging departments (e.g. vascular surgery, urology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, anaesthetics and pain management) are starting to use or increase their use of fluoroscopically guided procedures in surgical theatres without the radiation protection tools available in standard interventional laboratories (ICRP, 2010). Such a practice may result in occupational doses or these physicians that are higher than the typical values recorded in interventional radiology and cardiology services, where protection tools are used regularly (6). Lack of compliance with the regular use of personal dosimetry has been a problem for many years in many countries (5, 7). This is one of the reasons for the shortage of an accurate occupational dose data (and reliable radiation risk estimations) in different professional groups. One of the methods of estimating staff doses is working on Monte Carlo calculations and detection of staff location in the catheterisation laboratory to calculate approximately staff doses during clinical procedures through the use of radiographic and geometric data. Another method that was recently published is use of a realistic approach to estimate lens doses in interventional cardiology when personal dosimeters are not used regularly. The authors concluded that for around 2000 diagnostic, PCI, and valvular procedures, when the median scatter dose value per procedure at the C-arm was 0.78, 1.07, and 1.45 mSv, respectively (4). Lens doses are approximately 50-60% of these values when radiation protection tools are not used. For all of these procedures, the ratio between the scatter dose at the C-arm and the kerma-area product was 10.3-11.3 mSv(Gy cm2)-1 (6). Several medical societies including CIRSE and SIR have published or endorsed documents on occupational protection that are also expected to improve staff radiation safety (7). New ethical issues are emerging in situations where reducing patient dose involves increasing staff doses and vice versa. Occupational radiological protection is still a challenge in several clinical situations. ICRP has included specific recommendations and advice for occupational protection in most of its publications in recent years (ICRP, 2000, 2007 a,b,c, 2009, 2010, 2013 a,b). Operator dose (incident air kerma) at the typical working position is around 1/1000 of incident air kerma at the patient's skin, so the instantaneous dose rate to an unprotected operator may reach approximately 5mGymin-1. Newer active personal dosimeters display occupational dose rates in real time inside the interventional fluoroscopy suite, and allow subsequent detailed analyses of staff and patient doses by recording dose at very short intervals. This data on implementation of the real time active personnel dosimetry permit the development of new optimisation strategies to improve occupational protection (7, 9).",Excluded

2706,"Robotics in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery: A critical review of existing systems and proposed specifications for new robotic platforms. BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in image guidance, endoscopy, and tube-shaft instruments have allowed for the further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times, reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved longterm outcomes, the technical skills required to perform such surgery are inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques, and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance surgical performance. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the role of surgical robots in keyhole transcranial endoscopeassisted microsurgery. METHOD(S): The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of presently available robotic systems was performed. RESULT(S): Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field. CONCLUSION(S): New robotic platforms in minimally invasive neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant clinical penetration.

Purpose: High-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a common treatment option for locally advanced prostate cancer. Quality of life is an important factor when discussing therapy options for high-risk prostate cancer. This study evaluated adverse effects and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).Materials and Methods: Ninety male patients (median age, 71 years; range, 50 to 79 years) with high-risk prostate cancer underwent HDR-BT after EBRT between December 2009 and January 2017 with a median follow-up of 43 months. A total of 57 patients (69.5%) answered the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life of Cancer Patients questionnaire (QLQ-C30; ver. 3.0), and 8 patients died during follow-up. In order to put the results of this study in context, we compared the results with reference data from the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Correlations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, International Prostate Symptom Score, and HRQOL measures were calculated.Results: The study participants reported better physical functioning and better global health compared with the reference data, but worse social, role, and cognitive functioning. We found negative statistically significant correlations between the last-measured PSA value and social functioning (p>0.01), cognitive functioning, pain, and constipation (all p<0.05). Toxicity rates were 10.0% for gastrointestinal and 12.2% for genitourinary adverse effects. All reported complications for toxicity were Grade I.Conclusions: The described therapy results in high biochemical control rates with minimal adverse effects. Compared with reference groups, the HRQOL of this study cohort was acceptable. PSA values during follow-up seem to be a possible indicator to influence HRQOL.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in achieving a partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to propose guidelines for optimal treatment Methods. During a 5-year period, 29 patients (19 male and 10 female) with 92 brain metastases from RCC underwent GKS. The median tumor volume was 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.5-14.5 cm<sup>3</sup>). Fourteen patients (48%) also underwent whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) before GKS, and two patients (6.8%) after GKS. The mean GKS dose delivered to the 50% isodose at the tumor margin was 16.8 Gy (range 13-30 Gy). All cases were categorized according to the Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification for brain metastases. Univariate analysis was performed to determine significant prognostic factors and survival. The overall median survival was 7 months after GKS treatment. Age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and controlled primary disease were not predictors of survival. Combined WBRT/GKS resulted in median survival of 18, 8.5, and 5.3 months for RPA Classes I, II, and III, respectively, compared with the median survival 7.1, 4.2, and 2.3 months for patients treated with WBRT alone.

690,"Cardiotoxicity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients with Lung Cancer. Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activate the host immune system to target cancer cells. However, the unchecked systemic inflammatory response may result in cardiovascular immune-related adverse events, as myocarditis, pericardial disease, stress-induced, and dilated cardiomyopathy are increasingly reported in case series and pharmacovigilance databases. We sought to further investigate ICI-related cardiotoxicity in a cohort of patients with lung cancer. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary lung cancer treated with ICIs or non-ICI systemic therapy over three years to assess the likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Data was collected on co-morbidities, cardiovascular medications, past or concurrent radiation or systemic therapies, serum troponin, brain natriuretic peptide levels, pre- and post-treatment electrocardiograms, echocardiography, angiography, and total ICI dose. Each factor was compared between patients treated with ICIs and non-ICI systemic therapy. Result(s): We included 252 patients in our study. During a median follow-up of 6 months (interquartile range: 2-14 months), patients treated with ICIs (n = 135) who had a troponin elevation were more likely to sustain a MACE (hazard ratio: 6.9, 95% confidence interval: 3.2-15, p <0.001) with a median time to event of 33 days (Figure 1). Discussion(s): Patients with lung cancer on ICIs are more likely to incur a troponin elevation compared to patients on conventional chemotherapy. Elevated troponin is associated with an increased likelihood of MACE, especially early during treatment with ICIs. This data supports closer monitoring, including serial troponin measurements during the early phase of ICI therapy. Copyright © 2019",Excluded
2682,"Influence of extremely low frequency magnetic fields on Ca2+ signaling and NMDA receptor functions in rat hippocampus. Extremely low frequency (ELF<300Hz) electromagnetic fields affect several neuronal activities including memory. Because ELF magnetic fields cause altered Ca(2+) homeostasis in neural tissues, we examined their influence on Ca(2+) signaling enzymes in hippocampus and related them with NMDA receptor functions. Hippocampal regions were obtained from brains of 21-day-old rats that were exposed for 90 days to 50Hz magnetic fields at 50 and 100 microT intensities. In comparison to controls, ELF exposure caused increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels concomitant with increased activities of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC), cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin as well as decreased activity of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in hippocampal regions. Simultaneous ligand-binding studies revealed decreased binding to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors.

2364,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight. Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded
1686,"Intracranial hyperthermia through local photothermal heating with a fiberoptic microneedle device. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The fiberoptic microneedle device (FMD) seeks to leverage advantages of both laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to increase volumetric dispersal of locally infused chemotherapeutics through sub-lethal photothermal heat generation. This study focused on determination of photothermal damage thresholds with 1,064 nm light delivered through the FMD into in vivo rat models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDs capable of co-delivering laser energy and fluid agents were fabricated through a novel off-center splicing technique involving fusion of a multimode fiberoptic to light-guiding capillary tubing. FMDs were positioned at a depth of 2.5 mm within the cerebrum of male rats with fluoroptic temperature probes placed within 1 mm of the FMD tip. Irradiation (without fluid infusion) was conducted at laser powers of 0 (sham), 100, 200, 500, or 750 mW. Evans blue-serum albumin conjugated complex solution (EBA) and laser energy co-delivery were performed in a second set of preliminary experiments.RESULTS: Maximum, steady-state temperatures of 38.7 +/- 1.6 and 42.0 +/- 0.9 degreeC were measured for the 100 and 200 mW experimental groups, respectively. Histological investigation demonstrated needle insertion damage alone for sham and 100 mW irradiations. Photothermal damage was detected at 200 mW, although observable thermal damage was limited to a small penumbra of cerebral cortical microcavitation and necrosis that immediately surrounded the region of FMD insertion. Co-delivery of EBA and laser energy presented increased volumetric dispersal relative to infusion-only controls.CONCLUSION: Fluoroptic temperature sensing and histopathological assessments demonstrated that a laser power of 100 mW results in sub-lethal brain hyperthermia, and the optimum, sub-lethal target energy range is likely 100-200 mW. The preliminary FMD-CED experiments confirmed the feasibility of augmenting fluid dispersal using slight photothermal heat generation, demonstrating the FMD's potential as a way to increase the efficacy of CED in treating MG.",Excluded

Here, we delivered a single pulse of TMS (spTMS) to V5/MT during a motion direction discrimination task while concurrently manipulating the level of noise in the motion stimulus.

The observation posts included pre-radiation and 1 to 8 weeks after radiation. Each group underwent single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, after the completion of image acquisition, the animals were sacrificed, and histological specimens were obtained. Pathological changes were analyzed combined with MRS changes. Result(s): The metabolic ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) increased first and then decreased obviously. Cho/Cr was 1.52 +/- 0.28 pre-radiation, 3.20 +/- 0.72 at 4 weeks, and 2.04 +/- 0.05 at 8 weeks after radiation. The metabolic ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/Cr showed significant decrease tendency, which decreased to 1.28 +/- 0.05 8 weeks after radiation from pre-radiation value of 1.97 +/- 0.25. The metabolic ratios of Cho/NAA showed significant increase after irradiation, which increased to 2.04 +/- 0.78 at 8 weeks after radiation, while the value was 1.19 +/- 0.15 pre-irradiation.

A comparison of the effectiveness of TMS across studies is difficult due to the variety of chosen stimulation parameters, different inclusion criteria, and different designs.

2701,"Long-term results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer. Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemoresponsive tumor but overall survival remains poor even in limited disease (LD). With the aim of eradicating chemoresistant tumor cells and reducing toxicity, we investigated in this phase II trial the feasibility and outcome of a sequential approach of induction chemotherapy (CT) followed, in responding patients with LD-SCLC, by intensified platinum-based CT and concurrent thoracic irradiation (TI). Material(s) and Method(s): We treated 55 consecutive LD-SCLC patients with three 21-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, epiadriamycin and vincristine (CEV) as induction CT. In 44 (80%) patients there was an objective response and they received treatment intensification consisting of TI and concomitant CT with carboplatin and etoposide plus recombinant granulocite colony stimulating factor. Twenty-five (57%) patients were submitted to twice-daily thoracic irradiation (TDTI; 1.5 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 45 Gy) and 19 (43%) to once-daily thoracic irradiation (ODTI; 2 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 50 Gy). Result(s): Median follow up was 75 months (range, 42-102). Of 44 patients submitted to intensification with TI plus CT, 32 (73%) had a complete and 12 (27%) a partial response. Median overall survival of all 55 patients was 17 months with actuarial survival probabilities of 2 and 5 years, 32 and 25%, respectively. Analysis of patient sub-groups showed a 5-month median survival in non-responders, 19 in TDTI and 17 in ODTI patients, respectively. Two and 5 year survival probabilities were 0% in non-responders, 40 and 35% in TDTI and 39 and 21% in ODTI patients, respectively. At present, 13 of 44 responders are still alive, of which nine (20%) have been progression-free from 45 to 93 months (median 60). Treatment failure was registered in 31 (70%) of 44 patients who received both induction and intensification treatment. One-half of patients had intrathoracic recurrence, eight of which only local and the remaining seven local and distant. Fourteen (32%) patients had brain metastases. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 24 (55%) patients with no differences between treatment groups. Grade 3 esophagitis was registered in four (9%) patients: in 3/25 (12%) and 1/19 (5%) of those who received TDTI and ODTI, respectively (P=not significant). Acute radiation pneumonitis occurred in three (12%) patients submitted to TDTI. No clinically debilitating pulmonary fibrosis, permanent esophageal stricture or toxic death was observed. Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC patients late concurrent CT plus TI is feasible and effective. Our long-term results are similar to the best reported in the literature. Despite the high incidence of complete response obtained, however, one-half of the patients had intrathoracic relapse and one-third brain metastases. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In recent years, increasingly, other radiopharmaceuticals are in clinical use in the treatment of various malignant diseases. Although in principle these therapies-as in all applications of radionuclides-special radiation protection measures are required, a separate nuclear medicine therapy department is not necessary in many cases due to the lower or lack of gamma radiation. In the following article, four different radionuclide therapies are more closely presented which are emerging in the last years. One of them is the ""Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy,"" the so-called PRRT in which radiolabeled somatostatin (SST)-receptor(R) ligands are used in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. On the basis of radiolabeled antibodies against CD20-positive cells, the so-called radioimmunotherapy is used in the treatment of certain forms of malignant lymphoma.

Aims and background: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of combined chemoradiation in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. The main end points were time to progression and overall survival. Method(s): Thirty-one patients with glioblastoma multiforme underwent surgery whenever possible and then received intravenous VM26 (120 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and oral CCNU (120 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for three cycles followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy). Result(s): Surgery consisted of a complete resection in 39% of patients, partial resection in 35% and a biopsy in 26%. Sixteen patients had clinical or radiological evidence of progression during or after chemotherapy. Hematologic toxicity was mild. Forty-five percent of patients received the scheduled dose of radiation. The outcome was disappointing, with a median time to progression of 18 weeks and median survival of 37.17 weeks. Conclusion(s): The survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme remains disappointing. Multimodal therapy does not seem to modify the evolution of the tumor. Stratification according to prognostic factors might detect a potential benefit of other therapeutic approaches.",Excluded
3749,"Identification of the S3 foramen during transforaminal sacral neuromodulation lead placement-a novel ""rolling pen"" technique. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is FDA approved for urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urgency urinary incontinence, non-obstructive urinary retention and fecal incontinence. SNM modulates electrical input to the bladder preventing and decreasing over stimulation, thus improving symptoms. The S3 foramen must be localized for lead implantation and the efficacy of implantation depends on the ability to localize S3 reliably and correctly. Localization is accomplished using various strategies, most commonly using a combination of palpation of bony landmarks and fluoroscopy. This paper will serve to introduce a novel ""rolling pen"" technique that eliminates the use of fluoroscopy for S3 identification. This technique is currently used in clinical practice by the two highest volume implanters in Louisiana. METHOD(S): The patients were positioned prone and prepped in the usual manner. Instead of using fluoroscopy or palpation to identify bony landmarks to localize the S3 foramen, we balanced a marking pen longitudinally in the midline of the sacrum. The pen was allowed to roll until horizontal equilibrium was established. The fulcrum of the balanced ""rolling pen"" identified the level of S3. A mark 2 cm proximal and 2 cm lateral to this landmark was made for entry of the finder needle at the level of the skin. We then proceeded with our implantation in the usual manner. The rolling pen technique was used for all patients as our initial strategy to identify the S3 foramen. RESULT(S): 228 implantations were performed between 7/2012 and 10/2014 at our 2 tertiary centers. All cases used the rolling pen technique as our initial S3 foramen identification strategy. Adhering to the ALARA principle, fluoroscopy was limited to confirming and adjusting needle and lead placement in the operating room. All office procedures were performed without fluoroscopy. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that the novel rolling pen technique can be used as yet another method for S3 localization during transforaminal lead placement during SNM implantation. This decreases radiation exposure and likely cost.",Excluded
3377,"Direct Parametric Reconstruction for Improved Characterization of Neurotransmitter Release using Dynamic PET. Objectives: Kinetic analyses of dynamic PET data with reversibly binding receptor-ligand radiotracers can be used to detect endogenous neurotransmitter (NT) releases elicited by cognitive tasks or drug stimulation. Conventionally, NT release is characterized by fitting time-activity curves (TACs) with an appropriate kinetic model such as LSRRM (Alpert et al 2003), an extension of the simplified reference region model that incorporates time-varying binding due to tracer displacement by NT. A limitation of this 'indirect' approach, however, is the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the estimated parametric images. In the current work, we developed a method for estimation of LSRRM parametric maps with significantly higher SNR by direct parameter estimation from raw dynamic PET projection data. We conducted simulation and human C-raclopride studies to evaluate the performance of this method against the standard indirect method. Method(s): A numerical phantom comprised of 22 different brain regions including 7 striatal sub-divisions was created using the MNI atlas. Kinetic parameters values were assigned to each brain region based on measurements performed on 16 subjects studied with C-raclopride. Dopamine (DA) release was simulated in the striatum (executive area). LSRRM was used to generate the corresponding 4-D (i.e., 3-D + time) activity images which were then forward-projected to produce noise-free dynamic sinograms. Attenuation, detector sensitivity, point spread function and radioactive decay were modeled during sinogram data generation. After scaling to standard counts levels, Poisson noise was added to the sinograms to achieve noise levels comparable to our human studies. For empirical evaluation, a 45-min human study was conducted on the Siemens mMR camera using C-raclopride (13.5mCi). A reward task was started ~27 min after radiotracer injection to induce striatal DA release. For both simulation and human studies, parametric images of binding potential with non-displaceable reference (BP<inf>ND</inf>) and magnitude of DA release (gamma) were computed using the indirect method and the proposed direct method. For the indirect approach, parameters were estimated by pixel-wise application of LSRRM using the cerebellum as a reference tissue input and weighted least-squares fitting of TACs obtained following fully-3D dynamic OSEM reconstruction. No post-reconstruction smoothing was included. For the direct method, parameters were directly estimated from the dynamic sinograms by preconditioned conjugate gradient based optimization of a four-dimensional Poisson log-likelihood objective function incorporating LSRRM kinetics and accounting for the effects of attenuation, sensitivity, scatter and randoms. Result(s): In simulation studies, the indirect method estimated striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma with 7.8% and 79.2% bias, respectively. For the direct reconstruction, bias was reduced to 6.9% and 5.5% for striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates, respectively. Coefficients of variation ('CV', i.e. pixel-wise variability) of striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates were 65.3% and 72.0% for the indirect method as compared to 17.4% and 17.9% for the direct method. Likewise, in the human study, the direct method yielded BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma images with improved SNR. CV of BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates in the putamen were 71.4% and 91.4% for the indirect method and 32.9% and 37.6% for the direct method. Conclusion(s): Direct reconstruction can reduce bias and increase the SNR of parametric images. The method has the potential to improve the characterization of localized neurotransmitter release, potentially allowing detection of weaker effects, reducing the needed sample size, or reducing radioactivity dose to facilitate repeated experiments or minimize radiation exposure.",Excluded
483,"Low (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle radiation lead to a persistent reduction in the spatial learning ability of rats. Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is considered to be a potential health risk in long-term space travel, and it represents a significant risk to the central nervous system (CNS). The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.

2624,"Locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Delivering neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Purpose/Objective(s): The standard of care for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Patients with large tumors at presentation which are close to dose-limiting structures such as the optic chiasm and brain stem may pose a challenging clinical problem. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) prior to CRT can be used to shrink the tumor and may therefore be a valuable strategy to optimize treatment planning. Studies in Asia have reported favorable outcomes with NC for NPC. The goal of this study was to characterize the patterns of use of NC for NPC at a Canadian center. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of locally advanced NPC patients treated between 2000 and 2013. Patients who received NC with the intention to downsize locally advanced tumors prior to CRT were included. Baseline demographics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy treatments, and follow-up data were obtained from institutional databases and chart review and analyzed with SPSS. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local regional relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions. Result(s): Forty-six patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 47 (range 18-75). Eighty percent of patients were male, 74% were of Asian ethnicity, and 87% had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Ninetyfour percent of patients had T3 or T4 tumors; 80% were node positive; 26% stage III, 67% IVA, 4% IVB. NC regimens included cisplatin/gemcitabine 87%, cisplatin/fluorouracil 6%, and cisplatin/etoposide 6%. The total neoadjuvant dose of cisplatin received ranged from 24mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 325 mg/m<sup>2</sup> with a median dose of 160mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most common dose fractionations prescribed were 70 Gy in 35fractions for 67% of cases and 66 Gy in 33 fractions for 13%. Forty-two of the 46 patients went on to receive CRT, and the total concurrent cisplatin dose delivered was <200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 21 patients (46%) and >200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 25 patients (54%). In multivariate analysis of the 42 patients who received concurrent chemotherapy, the ability to deliver over 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> concurrent chemotherapy with radiation was not impacted by the dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, age, sex, ECOG, or ethnicity. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (0.17-10.6 years). Twenty-three percent of patients had a local recurrence, 13% developed distant metastases, and there were 7 deaths, 6 deaths due to NPC.

Most patients tolerated CRT after NC, and half of patients received 5 or more concurrent cycles. The dose of NC given did not lower the dose concurrent chemotherapy later tolerated. This institution is currently evaluating the volumetric impact of NC on tumor size while we await the results of ongoing randomized trials of NC followed by CRT in this patient population.",Excluded

It's incidence increases with age, slightly more in men than women. Less than 20% live longer than 1 year. Method(s): We present a case of a female patient who was diagnosed with a colo-rectal cancer. The cancer was staged as pT-3, N-0, M-0, G-2, R-0. He underwent a surgical intervention with colo-anal anastomosis. Than he was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: 5-FU and radiation. He was followed -up at the outpatient clinic of surgery. Two years later the patient complaint of back pain. A CT scan was performed, which found a solid lesion of the body of the pancreas with peripancreatic and truncus celiacus infiltration. Multiple liver metastes were found. A thoracic CT scan revealed metastatic lesions of both lungs, 7-8 mm in diameter. In these conditions the clinical diagnosis was made: Pancreatic cancer with pulmonary and liver metastatis, diabetes mellitus.

1944,"Improved detection of Alzheimeras disease via addition of early FBB PET. Background: In nuclear medicine, some recent studies have continuously reported that 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) amyloid PET obtained early after intravenous injection (eFBB) reflects blood perfusion and neuronal function to detect Alzheimeras Disease (AD). If eFBB can be used for AD diagnosis, it can help to reduce radiation exposure and increase patient convinnience by discriminating between amyloid nagative AD and positive NC and replacing 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Method(s): We retrospectively collected 264 cases of eFBB, which included amyloid positive NC (25.42%) and negative AD (16.82%). In order to obtain SUVr for analysis, eFBB and dFBB images of each case were spatially registered though CT template and eFBB template, and count normalization was applied to cerebellum, brainstem, and whole brain regions, respectively to identify the best pre-processing step. We evaluated the explanatory power and classification performance of the data according to the intervention of eFBB through logistic regression analysis (LRA) and stratified 4-fold cross validation. For visual observation of the image, we observed the intensity distribution of the image through the t-contrast embedded in the SPM. Result(s): As a result of LRA, the highest explanatory power and classification performance (Nagelkerke R2=0.648, Accuracy=89.4%) were observed when using eFBB template and whole brain region as a reference region. Regardless, when both eFBB and dFBB were known to the model, the explanatory power and classification performance were improved. In evaluating the generalization performance of the selected model, it was also shown that classification performance improved when eFBB was involved in general.

2532,"Delayed occurrence of ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) 5 years after the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine carcinoma. Background: Ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) in patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is characterized by increased mortality, however early detection and treatment of EAS may improve survival. In rare cases, EAS can arise >3 months after NEC diagnosis (metachronously). Elevations in plasma levels of the ACTH precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and/or agouti-related peptide (AgRP) have been associated with EAS. Clinical Case: A 61-year-old woman with a 5-year history of a poorly-differentiated lung neuroendocrine carcinoma with widely-disseminated metastases, treated with chemotherapy and radiation, was admitted for new-onset hypokalemia, 2 weeks after the initiation of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for lower extremity edema. Despite discontinuation of HCTZ, hypokalemia persisted and 120-200 meq of potassium chloride daily were required to maintain normal potassium levels. Proximal muscle weakness and hyperglycemia were noted. Morning cortisol and ACTH levels were 48 mcg/dL (nl 4.8-19.5mcg/dL) and 141pg/mL (nl 6-58 pg/mL) respectively, compared to a morning cortisol and ACTH of 9.3mcg/dL and 19pg/mL 5 years prior, at the time of NEC diagnosis. Serum cortisol was 61mcg/dL after an overnight 1mg dexamethasone suppression test and urinary free cortisol was 7544mcg/24h (nl<45mcg/24h), confirming the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma POMC and AgRP were measured and were 80 fmol/mL (nl <45 fmol/mL) and 884 pg/mL (nl<280 pg/mL), respectively, supporting a diagnosis of EAS. Potassium levels normalized following spironolactone treatment. Metyrapone therapy was initiated, but hypercortisolism persisted and the patient succumbed to multifocal pneumonia 4 weeks after presentation. Postmortem examination showed an absence of ACTH immunoreactivity in metastatic tumor tissue obtained at the time of diagnosis of NEC, as well as in the tissues biopsied 3 years later (subcarinal lymph node, liver). However, sites of tumor metastases (subcutaneous shoulder mass, ovary) sampled 4 or more years after NEC diagnosis showed focal staining for ACTH, consistent with EAS arising years after the development of NEC. Conclusion(s): This case highlights the rare occurrence of ectopic metachronous ACTH secretion occurring in a NEC. The observed elevations in plasma POMC likely reflect aberrant tumoral processing of POMC to ACTH. While glucocorticoids may modulate the synthesis and release of AgRP, the magnitude of the elevation in plasma AgRP in this case supports the possibility of a concomitant tumoral AgRP source. The elevations in plasma POMC and AgRP in EAS associated with NEC in this case underscore the potential utility of these neuropeptides as tumor markers that could improve clinical monitoring for EAS and facilitate more timely interventions to optimize survival.",Excluded

3295,"Combined endoscopic endonasal surgery and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS) for complex cranial base tumors-early clinical outcomes. Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been shown to be a feasible approach to cranial base tumors while reducing post-operative morbidity. Using the endoscopic endonasal approach alone or in combination with open approaches may provide advantages over conventional approaches. However, the balance between maximal resection and minimal injury to neurovascular structures frequently precludes gross total resection (GTR). Consequently, adjuvant radiation therapy may be an important option to improve local control (LC) of residual disease. In this retrospective series, we report clinical outcomes, morbidity, and LC of 40 patients with cranial base tumors treated with EES +/- combined open approach followed by fSRS (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc.). 26 patients had benign disease, 7 had newly diagnosed malignant disease, and 7 had previously resected malignant disease. Surgical outcomes were evaluable in all patients. LC after fSRS was evaluable in 39 patients and defined as no evidence of regrowth by MRI, CT, & physical examination. GTR was achieved in 12/40. Median post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. In multivariable analysis controlling for anatomic location and malignant histology, post-operative complications (n = 10) were significantly associated with patients having combined open and EES (p < 0.01, OR = 16.9). SRS was delivered in 1-5 sessions to a median marginal dose of 24.9 Gy. Median follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1.5 to 61 months). LC was achieved in 89.7% (35/39) of evaluable patients. LC was achieved in 11/12 patients who had GTR. Median progression-free survival was 19.7 months (21.0 months for benign tumors (n = 26), 5.8 months for previously resected malignant disease (n = 7), and 21.2 months for newly diagnosed malignant disease (n = 7). Of the 31 patients who had symptomatic disease at presentation, 18 (58%) reported complete symptom resolution, 9 partial, and 4 no improvement. One patient who received two prior courses of radiation therapy developed osteosclerosis (grade III). Other adverse events were erythema (grade I, n = 5), nausea (grade II, n = 2), conjunctivitis (grade II, n = 1). EES followed by fSRS is a safe and effective management strategy for selected cranial base tumors. EES combined with an open surgical approach may result in increased complications. However, initial follow-up offers encouraging results indicating shorter time to recovery, acceptable LC rates compared to conventional approaches, and similar median time to progression for benign and newly diagnosed malignant disease.",Excluded

This case is well reproduced by ex-vivo samples of 90<sup>Y</sup>-marked Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP NET) in the bowel. These specimens indeed include at least three wide independent sources of background associated to three anatomical districts (mesentery, intestine, mucose).

We show that the use of electrons, a short range particle, instead of gamma particles, allows to limit counts read on a lesion to the sum of the tumor signal plus the background generated by the sole hosting district. The background on adjacent districts in the same specimen/patient is found to differ up to a factor 4, showing how the specificity and sensitivity of the beta<sup>-</sup>-RGS technique can be fully exploited only upon a correct measurement of the contributing background. This locality has been used to set a site-specific cut-off algorithm to discriminate tumor and healthy tissue with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity, on this test data sample, close to 100%. Factors influencing the sensitivity are also discussed.

Also, she has had involvement of cardiac muscle, her neurological system (unable to raise the left arm), spleen, lungs (stage 2, bilateral hilar adenopathy with infiltrates), and bony involvement of hands (arthritis and clubbing.) Often, patients with stage 2 sarcoidosis tend to go into remission spontaneously (40-70%.) In our patient's case, none of her multi-organ system manifestations abated. Up until this point, her lifelong condition has never been treated despite her symptoms because she refused corticosteroids. Superimposed on this patient were additional inflammatory diagnoses: Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, treated lyme disease, second degree heart block, spinal meningitis, tick-borne alpha 1,3 galactose allergy. When we met the patient our focus was patient-centered education. We convinced our patient to accept steroid treatment because PET-MRI imaging may now detect scar vs. inflamed, viable tissue in her ventricle with enhanced sensitivity. Discussion(s): Newer-generation PET-MRI scans have ability to differentiate scar vs. inflammatory muscle with enhanced sensitivity. This improves clinical decision-making. Only 40-50% patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are diagnosed during their lifetime. To avert missed diagnoses, the advent of improved PET-MRI allows us to detect and treat cardiac sarcoidosis. It is incumbent to treat, because, if left untreated, the risk of sudden death from cardiac sarcoidosis is as high as 85%. Recent developments in PET technology reduce radiation dose. In our patient's situation, her decision to finally initiate therapy at age 54 was based on a patient-centered, empathic, compassionate explanation of the multi-system organ nature of her disease and the advantageous properties of PET-MRI to detect a treatable cause of dyspnea.",Excluded
668,"Glioblastoma multiforme outcomes of 107 patients treated in two Singapore institutions. INTRODUCTION Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour in adults. Although the survival rate for GBM has improved with recent advancements in treatment, the prognosis remains generally poor. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of GBM patients seen in National University Hospital, Singapore, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from January 2002 to December 2011. Data on disease and treatment factors was collected and correlated with survival. RESULTS Data on a total of 107 GBM patients was analysed. Their median survival time was 15.1 months and the two-year survival rate was 23.5%, which is comparable with data published in other series. The factors associated with improved median survival time were radiotherapy dose > 50 Gy (16.1 months vs. 8.7 months, p = 0.01) and adjuvant concurrent chemotherapy (16.4 months vs. 9.2 months, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION GBM confers a poor prognosis. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy are associated with improved survival. Ethnicity may be a contributing factor to differences in GBM incidence and prognosis. Copyright © 2017, Singapore Medical Association. All rights reserved.",Excluded

From May 1992 to January 2001, 115 consecutive patients with 425 lesions were treated over 128 treatment sessions. Forty three patients were known to have died at the end of the recording period. The mean follow-up duration was 11.6 months and mean number of lesions was 3.5. The most common primary sites were lung and breast. Mean tumor volume was 4.2 cm<sup>3</sup> and mean margin dose was 16.2 Gy. 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month survival rates were 73.6, 58, and 46%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher KPS scores, no evidence of extracranial metastasis, and controlled primary disease were significantly related to longer survival. Adjuvant whole brain irradiation did not significantly influence on the prolongation of survival time and local control of radiosurgically treated lesions. Copyright © 2002 S.

I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is the most commonly used functional imaging agent in patients with neuroblastoma, but use of [F-18]- FDG PET is increasing. MIBG is useful for defining the extent of disease at diagnosis, following response to treatment, and localizing residual and recurrent disease. In early-stage disease, FDG is often better concentrated in tumor sites than MIBG. In all stages, disease extent in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and local metastases may be better delineated by FDG. In advanced-stage disease, MIBG is superior for following the treatment response of metastatic tumor in the marrow and bone. Several C-11- and F-18-labeled tracers may be equal to or superior to I-123-MIBG if supply problems can be resolved. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Proton beam radiotherapy, an innovative treatment modality, allows delivery of high radiation doses to the target while sparing surrounding healthy structures. The Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO), equipped with a synchrotron and capable of using both protons and ions, initiated its clinical activity in September 2011. The first treatment of a skull base tumor with protons is reported here. The case of a 26-year-old man with an intracranial low-grade chondrosarcoma of the right petroclival junction is discussed with emphasis on technical and clinical details. Two previous surgical interventions had achieved partial removal of the tumor and the patient was treated with protons for residual disease. The prescribed dose was 70 GyE in 35 fractions of 2 GyE. Treatment was completed with minimal acute toxicity consisting of grade 1 alopecia and nausea. Nine months after treatment the disease is locally controlled. Use of high-energy protons at CNAO is a safe and effective means of treating a tumor located near critical normal structures. © - Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore downloaded by ELSEVIER BV IP.",Excluded

2563,"Asynchronous inputs and NMDA conductances predict excitatory responses in the cortical-cA1 pathway of the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, CA1 place cells are driven by a substantial input from CA3. There is a second pathway to CA1 from the entorhinal cortex. The mode of action of cortex on CA1 through this pathway is not known. The pathway supports CA1 place field activity after CA3 has been lesioned, yet stimulation of the pathway in rat slices results in strong feedforward inhibition that prevents pyramidal cell action potentials. We use a detailed conductance-based model of this pathway to simulate the response to cortical stimulation in slice experiments and in vivo spatial exploration. We find that the presence of NMDA conductances enable CA1 pyramidal cells to integrate cortical inputs over a time scale longer than that which is effective in recruiting the inhibitory response that can suppress action potentials. We then show that this asynchronous response mode supports place field formation in response to experimentally constrained spatially modulated cortical activity. Within this model, the inclusion of GABAB conductances and the hyperpolarisation activated current I(h) reduces the strength of the GABAA inputs required to balance the excitatory inputs, and this facilitates place field formation by reducing variability in the inhibitory inputs.",Excluded
3620,"Load Dependency of Postural Control--Kinematic and Neuromuscular Changes in Response to over and under Load Conditions. INTRODUCTION: Load variation is associated with changes in joint torque and compensatory reflex activation and thus, has a considerable impact on balance control. Previous studies dealing with over (OL) and under loading (UL) used water buoyancy or additional weight with the side effects of increased friction and inertia, resulting in substantially modified test paradigms. The purpose of this study was to identify gravity-induced load dependency of postural control in comparable experimental conditions and to determine the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms.METHODS: Balance performance was recorded under normal loading (NL, 1 g), UL (0.16 g 0.38 g) and OL (1.8 g) in monopedal stance. Center of pressure (COP) displacement and frequency distribution (low 0.15-0.5 Hz (LF), medium 0.5-2 Hz (MF), high 2-6 Hz (HF)) as well as ankle, knee and hip joint kinematics were assessed. Soleus spinal excitability was determined by H/M-recruitment curves (H/M-ratios).RESULTS: Compared to NL, OL caused an increase in ankle joint excursion, COP HF domain and H/M-ratio. Concomitantly, hip joint excursion and COP LF decreased. Compared to NL, UL caused modulations in the opposite direction: UL decreased ankle joint excursions, COP HF and H/M-ratio. Collaterally, hip joint excursion and COP LF increased. COP was augmented both in UL and in OL compared to NL.CONCLUSION: Subjects achieved postural stability in OL and UL with greater difficulty compared to NL. Reduced postural control was accompanied by modified balance strategies and compensatory reflex activation. With increasing load, a shift from hip to ankle strategy was observed. Accompanying, COP frequency distribution shifted from LF to HF and spinal excitability was enhanced. It is suggested that in OL, augmented ankle joint torques are compensated by quick reflex-induced postural reactions in distal muscles. Contrarily, UL is associated with diminished joint torques and thus, postural equilibrium may be controlled by the proximal segments to adjust the center of gravity above the base of support.",Excluded

Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) frequently utilize healthcare services and undergo radiological studies to assess refractory headache symptoms despite cerebrospinal fluid diversion. To delineate the clinical utility of different imaging modalities and to estimate cumulative patient radiation exposure in shunted patients with IIH, we retrospectively reviewed 100 randomly selected patients with IIH and a prior cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure treated at our institution between July 2010 and August 2018. Patients had an average of 16.3 office (SD +/- 13.8), 12.4 emergency department (+/- 21.0), and 4.6 inpatient (+/- 5.1) encounters over an average 4.8 years of follow-up. Patients underwent an average of 9.0 head CTs (+/- 8.1), 10.3 shunt series x-rays (+/- 11.2), and 4.3 MRIs (+/- 3.7). Approximated radiation exposure per patient was 21.4 mSv (+/- 18.7). Radiological studies performed for acute symptoms usually demonstrated no actionable findings (82.5% CTs, 97.5% shunt series x-rays, and 79.6% MRIs). Shunted IIH patients undergo numerous radiological studies and are subject to considerable levels of radiation, yet imaging shows actionable findings in less than 10% percent of radiographic studies.

3511,"Thymoquinone induces cell killing in glioblastoma cells through generation of DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common type of brain tumor in humans. Surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy is the current standard treatment; however, due to the upregulation of several survival pathways, tumor recurrence is quite common with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of glioblastoma. Naturally occurring phytochemicals have steadily received much scientific attention, owing to the fact that many of these compounds have potent action against tumors. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the bioactive compound of the volatile oil extracted from the black seed, Nigella sativa. TQ has shown anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions with a selective cytotoxicity for human cancer cells compared to several normal cells. Here, we show that TQ is able to dose-dependently inhibit colony formation in three distinct glioblastoma cell lines (T98, U87 and Gli36), with the highly tumorigenic Gli36 being the most sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of TQ. We also show that TQ induces persistent -H2AX activation, a marker of DNA double strand breaks, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TQ also causes G2/M cell cycle arrest in GBM cells to a degree that correlates with the cells' relative clonogenic sensitivity. Moreover, co-treatment with TQ and N-acetyl cysteine, a simple thiol nucleophile and antioxidant, prevented cell death, DNA double strand breaks, and cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that TQ is a potent inhibitor of GBM cell proliferation and growth, and that this effect may be mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species.",Excluded

The study was aimed at quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the muscle fibres and the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle of animals after a space flight on Biosputnik 936. Ultrastructural morphometric studies of the muscle fibres demonstrated diminished volume of sarcomer and accumulation of glycogen granules. The mean number of mitochondrial profiles decreased. The investigations of the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle showed diminution of the mean number of synaptic vesicles and swelling of the mitochondria. This changing in the fibres and axonal endings we can interpret as the first step of degeneration.,Included

I was an Astronaut with two space shuttle missions already completed. I was aware of the progressive and degenerative path the disease follows but, I was not ready to quit flying into earth orbit. NASA managers responsible for crew selection and certification were fully behind my desire to continue in the cue for another space mission. With the exception of the NASA leadership I kept my condition as a secret for 17 years. I was assigned to a third space shuttle mission and I performed a space walk during the mission in March 1996. This was very rewarding. I told myself to ""Live life to the fullest extent possible"". My message to those with Parkinson Disease is you can do anything you want to do - maybe not as well as you use to perform. I still play golf. My game is not as good as it was years ago but I enjoy the game. My friends enjoy playing with me and the exercise is good therapy. The disease has progressed as expected. I no longer fly privately and I do miss the exhilaration of precise flying. I still live life's adventures to the fullest.

Some survivors develop an irreversible decrease in neurological function, and the mortality rate is as high as 70% in severe cases. PBMT is an alternative to treat secondary injuries due to TBI. <b>Methods:</b> This multidisciplinary clinical study was carried out on 10 chronic adult patients with severe TBI, who were treated with PBMT with an optical device containing 13 sets of 4 light emitting diodes, and underwent hemodynamic transcranial Doppler and neuropsychological evaluation at three different times: pre-PBMT, post-PBMT (after a week), and late-PBMT, which occurred 3 months after the last session.

PBMTs were performed for 18 sessions for 6 weeks and 30 min per session. <b>Results:</b> The results found an alteration in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as a consequent increase of the cerebral oxygenation that helped to improve the cerebral function. <b>Conclusions:</b> The PBMT contributed to increased CBF, evidenced mainly by the increased left peak systolic velocity, which consequently increased the hemodynamic response after the PBMT and impacts on the peripheral cerebral perfusion contributing to improved cerebral function.",Excluded
853,"Neurogenesis in the adult spinal cord in an experimental model of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, demyelination, axonal degeneration and accumulation of neurological disability. Previously, we demonstrated that stem cells constitute a possible endogenous source for remyelination. We now addressed the question of whether neurogenesis can occur in neuroinflammatory lesions. We demonstrated that, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, induced in rats 1,1'-dioctadecyl-6,6'-di(4sulphopentyl)-3,3,3',3'tetramethylindocarbocyanin(DiI)-labelled ependymal cells not only proliferated but descendants migrated to the area of neuroinflammation and differentiated into cells expressing the neuronal markers beta-III-tubulin and NeuN. Furthermore, these cells were immunoreactive for bromodeoxyuridine and PCNA, markers for cells undergoing cell proliferation. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on freshly isolated 1, DiI-labelled cells from spinal cord lesions we demonstrated the ability of these cells to fire overshooting action potentials similar to those of immature neurones. We thus provide the first evidence for the initiation of neurogenesis in neuroinflammatory lesions in the adult spinal cord.",Excluded

PURPOSE: This study reports on the whole-body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist.METHODS: In three healthy male volunteers, whole-body scans were performed up to 2 h following i.v. injection of 320+/-65 MBq [11C]raclopride. Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study. The kidneys, urinary bladder wall, liver and gall-bladder received the highest absorbed doses. The average effective dose of [11C]raclopride was estimated to be 6.7+/-0.4 microSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: The amount of [11C]raclopride required for adequate dopamine D2 receptor imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent, permitting two or three repeated clinical PET imaging studies, with the injection of 222 MBq for each study.",Excluded

The repair of X-ray-induced DNA damage during G2 cell-cycle phase has been examined in lines of skin fibroblasts from three patients with trichothiodystrophy (TTD), one with apparently normal and two with defective nucleotide excision repair (NER). These responses are compared with those of five lines from clinically normal controls, lines from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), Down syndrome (DS), and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients. Chromosomal DNA repair was measured as the chromatid aberration frequency (CAF) or total number of chromatid breaks and long gaps per 100 metaphase cells, determined 0.5-1.5 h after X-irradiation (53 rad). Chromatid breaks and gaps (as defined herein) represent unrepaired DNA strand breaks. Only one of the TTD lines, TTD 1BR, showed an abnormally high CAF. This line was shown subsequently to be of a different complementation group, representing a new nucleotide excision repair gene. An abnormally high CAF was also observed, as reported previously, in XP-C, AT and DS but not in CS skin fibroblasts.

2378,"Treatment of cerebral radionecrosis by hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Clinically observed adverse radiation effects (ARE) are rather uncommon, but modern imaging reveals that they are more common after radiosurgery than previously believed. Little is known about the pathogenesis, and current treatment is mostly empirical. The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) on radiation-induced bone and soft tissue necrosis is known in lesions in the maxillofacial area, the mouth and in the head and neck. HBO raises the tissue pO2 and initiates a cellular and vascular repair mechanism. This forms the basis for the hypothesis that it might also help alleviate the results of cerebral radionecrosis. This study is a preliminary attempt to test this hypothesis. Two patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were chosen for the study. They had been treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and had developed imaging signs consistent with ARE. They were treated by breathing 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (250 kPa) in sessions of 60 minutes per day. This treatment was repeated 40 times in cycles of ten sessions. Both responded well to HBO, one lesion disappeared and the other was reduced significantly in size. No adjuvant steroids were given. These results give evidence that HBO has a potential value in treating ARE but further experience will be needed to confirm its definite benefit.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Preclinical studies suggest that radiation can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance matrix invasion in several tumor types. To assess if this occurs clinically, we analyzed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for EMT markers (EMT-CTC) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiation. Materials/Methods: This prospective study enrolled 22 patients between April 2011 and May 2012. The primary endpoint was distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. None had induction chemotherapy. One patient had hypofractionated protons without chemotherapy. Serial blood samples (20 mL) were drawn at baseline (pretreatment), twice during treatment, and once at first follow-up. One tube of blood (10 mL) was sent to enumerate cytokeratin (CK)-positive/CD45-negative cells (HD-CTCs) using an automated microscopic image analysis system. A second tube was analyzed using the StemDx assay, a quantitative PCR-based assay to detect transcripts of EMT markers (SNAIL, TWIST, TG2, and CMET) on CTC in peripheral blood samples depleted of CD326/EpCAM+ CTC and CD45+ leukocytes by antibody coated magnetic beads. DMFS time was counted from date of first blood draw to the DM or death or last contact. Deaths without DM on the date of last contact were counted as events. Due to the small sample size, all times to event were subjected to univariable analysis using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the comparisons of distributions between groups were made using the log-rank test. Result(s): Patients had either stage 3A/B (n = 16), oligometastatic stage 4 (bone or brain) (n=2), or localized recurrent or positive margin disease after surgery that was amendable for definitive treatment (n = 4). The median follow-up for all patients from the time of first blood draw to the last contact date or death was 9.5 months, and for living patients was 11.1 months. At last follow-up, 8 had died, 8 progressed with DM, and 2 had in-field local relapse. Using the Epic Sciences assay,DMFSwas significantly associated with>=10 HD-CTCs/mL of blood (p = 0.036). The presence of CMET or SNAIL transcripts on CTC by StemDx also significantly predicted for both DMFS (p= 0.036) and recurrence of any type (p =0.02). Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we found an association between DMFS and either >= 10 HD-CTC/mL of blood or EMT markers CMET or SNAIL in NSCLC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation. While these data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients, EMT-CTCs may reflect metastatic burden as seen in some of the patients with elevated HD-CTC counts, and may be valuable biomarkers to risk stratify patients after definitive chemoradiation.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To examine the influence of radiation dose reduction on image quality and sensitivity of Volume Perfusion CT (VPCT) maps regarding the detection of ischemic brain lesions.METHODS AND MATERIALS: VPCT data of 20 patients with suspected ischemic stroke acquired at 80 kV and 180 mAs were included. Using realistic reduced-dose simulation, low-dose VPCT datasets with 144 mAs, 108 mAs, 72 mAs and 36 mAs (80 %, 60 %, 40 % and 20 % of the original levels) were generated, resulting in a total of 100 datasets. Perfusion maps were created and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) measurements were performed. Qualitative analyses were conducted by two blinded readers, who also assessed the presence/absence of ischemic lesions and scored CBV and CBF maps using a modified ASPECTS-score.RESULTS: SNR of all low-dose datasets were significantly lower than those of the original datasets (p < .05). All datasets down to 72 mAs (40 %) yielded sufficient image quality and high sensitivity with excellent inter-observer-agreements, whereas 36 mAs datasets (20 %) yielded poor image quality in 15 % of the cases with lower sensitivity and inter-observer-agreements.CONCLUSION: Low-dose VPCT using decreased tube currents down to 72 mAs (40 % of original radiation dose) produces sufficient perfusion maps for the detection of ischemic brain lesions.KEY POINTS: * Perfusion CT is highly accurate for the detection of ischemic brain lesions * Perfusion CT results in high radiation exposure, therefore low-dose protocols are required * Reduction of tube current down to 72 mAs produces sufficient perfusion maps.",Excluded
1144,"Decrease in synaptic transmission can reverse the propagation direction of epileptiform activity in hippocampus in vivo. Most types of epileptiform activity with synaptic transmission have been shown to propagate from the CA3 to CA1 region in hippocampus. However, nonsynaptic epileptiform activity induced in vitro is known to propagate slowly from the caudal end of CA1 toward CA2/CA3. Understanding the propagation modes of epileptiform activity, and their causality is important to revealing the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and developing new treatments. In this paper, the effect of the synaptic transmission suppression on the propagation of epilepsy in vivo was investigated by using multiple-channel recording probes in CA1. Nonsynaptic epileptiform activity was induced by calcium chelator EGTA with varied concentrations of potassium. For comparison, disinhibition synaptic epileptiform activity was induced by picrotoxin (PTX) with or without partial suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission. The propagation velocity was calculated by measuring the time delay between two electrodes separated by a known distance. The results show that in vivo nonsynaptic epileptiform activity propagates with a direction and velocity comparable to those observed in in vitro preparations. The direction of propagation for nonsynaptic activity is reversed from the PTX-induced synaptic activity. A reversal in propagation direction and change in velocity were also observed dynamically during the process of synaptic transmission suppression. Even a partial suppression of synaptic transmission was sufficient to significantly change the propagation direction and velocity of epileptiform activity. These results suggest the possibility that the measurement of propagation can provide important information about the synaptic mechanism underlying epileptic activity.",Excluded
1326,"Influence of rotational setup errors on dose in target and organs at risk in cranial radiotherapy. Purpose or Objective: The aim of this study is to detect dose aberrations in cranial radiation therapy in the target volume and adjacent organs at risk (OARs) caused by insufficient rotational setup correction. 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) fusions were considered as the gold standard and compared to 4 DOF and 3 DOF registrations. Material(s) and Method(s): Setup errors of 12 patients with cranial lesions undergoing radiotherapy and positioned with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were analyzed. The PTVs of the included patients were large and irregularly shaped and located near or overlapping cranial OARs such as brainstem, chiasm, optical nerves or lenses. A registration between planning CT and the first CBCT of the treatment course was performed using 6 DOF, 4 DOF and 3 DOF. Differences between the three registrations were implemented and the planning CT and associated structure set shifted and warped accordingly. To detect the DOF with the largest influence on the delivered dose a rotational error of 2degree, 3degree and 4degree was simulated in one rotational dimension at a time. Using the original parameters, the treatment plan was copied and recalculated to the warped image set. Dmax and Dmean of the cranial OARs and D98 and D2 for the respective CTV and PTV were analyzed. Result(s): Differences between 6 DOF and 4 or 3 DOF fusion ranged between -1.4degree and 2degree in pitch direction, -2.5degree to 2degree in yaw, and -4.4degree to 4.2degree in roll direction. Resulting median D98 in the PTV decreased by 0.7 Gy using only 3 DOF and increased by 0.08 Gy if 4 DOF were included. Maximum dose reduction of the PTV D98 was 2.96 Gy using 3 DOF and 0.39 Gy using 4 DOF. CTV dose decreased by 0.68 using only 3 DOF and by 0.03 Gy using 4 DOF. Resulting median dose effects in the OARs are displayed in Figure 1, with largest effects of additional 0.2 and 0.8 Gy for the left and right lenses, respectively. Doses for individual patients varied up to additional 6 Gy in the lenses and 3 Gy in the optic nerves. Effects on doses in the OARs and target volumes were generally larger with 3 DOF than with 4 DOF included, except for the brainstem with no visible difference. Pitch and roll setup errors had larger effects on the OARs compared to yaw setup deviations, as demonstrated in Figure 2. 2degree roll setup errors caused more than 5 Gy dose effect on the ipsilateral optical nerve and chiasm, followed by 2degree pitch errors resulting in over 3 Gy additional dose. The simulated 2degree yaw error had an effect of under 1 Gy on dose delivery. [Figure Presented] [Figure Presented] Conclusion(s): For cases involving higher dose effects on the evaluated structures, 4DOF registration improved plan conformity compared to 3DOF. Clinically relevant dose deviations in the CTV were not found in this patient collective. While mean dose delivery to OARs increased only slightly, up to 6 Gy in additional dose occurred for individual patient cases in this collective because of rotational errors. Safety margins for OARs could be a solution to this matter. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients (mean age 62 y, 8M, 7F) with unilobar disease were treated with right lobar SIRT utilizing resin microspheres (mean dose 34.1 mCi, range 11-80) between September 2009 and December 2013. Neoplasm types included hepatocellular (n=5), cholangiocarcinoma (n=4), metastatic colon (n=2), gallbladder (n=1), appendiceal (n=1), thyroid (n=1) and neuroendocrine (n=1). Total liver volumes, lobar volumes, FLR, and % of FLR hypertrophy from baseline (%FLR) were assessed prior to and after right lobar SIRT at 3m and 6m follow-up utilizing CT or MRI. Result(s): Follow-up imaging was available for 13/15 patients at 3m and 11/15 patients at 6m. Left lobe hypertrophy was seen at 3m (p=0.002) and 6m (p=0.003). Right lobe atrophy was also seen at 3m (p=0.02) and 6m (p=0.04). FLR hypertrophy was seen at both time points: 29.1% (range, 2.5-46.5, p=0.003) at 3m and 30.7% (range, 2.8-62.8, p=0.003) at 6m. The median % FLR at 3m and 6m was 23.5% and 37.5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Right lobar SIRT with resin microspheres is a promising technique for inducing FLR hypertrophy while simultaneously providing therapy to right-sided disease.",Excluded
2888,"Radiation Induces Distinct Changes in Defined Subpopulations of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells in the Adult Hippocampus. While irradiation can effectively treat brain tumors, this therapy also causes cognitive impairments, some of which may stem from the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. To study how radiation affects neurogenesis, we combine phenotyping of subpopulations of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells with double- and triple S-phase labeling paradigms. Using this approach, we reveal new features of division, survival, and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells after exposure to gamma radiation. We show that dividing neural stem cells, while susceptible to damage induced by gamma rays, are less vulnerable than their rapidly amplifying progeny. We also show that dividing stem and progenitor cells that survive irradiation are suppressed in their ability to replicate 0.5-1 day after the radiation exposure. Suppression of division is also observed for cells that entered the cell cycle after irradiation or were not in the S phase at the time of exposure. Determining the longer term effects of irradiation, we found that 2 months after exposure, radiation-induced suppression of division is partially relieved for both stem and progenitor cells, without evidence for compensatory symmetric divisions as a means to restore the normal level of neurogenesis. By that time, most mature young neurons, born 2-4 weeks after the irradiation, still bear the consequences of radiation exposure, unlike younger neurons undergoing early stages of differentiation without overt signs of deficient maturation. Later, 6 months after an exposure to 5 Gy, cell proliferation and neurogenesis are further impaired, though neural stem cells are still available in the niche, and their pool is preserved. Our results indicate that various subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus have different susceptibility to gamma radiation, and that neurogenesis, even after a temporary restoration, is impaired in the long term after exposure to gamma rays. Our study provides a framework for investigating critical issues of neural stem cell maintenance, aging, interaction with their microenvironment, and post-irradiation therapy.",Included
2145,"Rod visual pigment optimizes active state to achieve efficient G protein activation as compared with cone visual pigments. Most vertebrate retinas contain two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which show different photoresponses to mediate scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. These cells contain different types of visual pigments, rhodopsin and cone visual pigments, respectively, but little is known about the molecular properties of cone visual pigments under physiological conditions, making it difficult to link the molecular properties of rhodopsin and cone visual pigments with the differences in photoresponse between rods and cones. Here we prepared bovine and mouse rhodopsin (bvRh and mRh) and chicken and mouse green-sensitive cone visual pigments (cG and mG) embedded in nanodiscs and applied time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to compare their Gt activation efficiencies. Rhodopsin exhibited greater Gt activation efficiencies than cone visual pigments. Especially, the Gt activation efficiency of mRh was about 2.5-fold greater than that of mG at 37 degreeC, which is consistent with our previous electrophysiological data of knock-in mice. Although the active state (Meta-II) was in equilibrium with inactive states (Meta-I and Meta-III), quantitative determination of Meta-II in the equilibrium showed that the Gt activation efficiency per Meta-II of bvRh was also greater than those of cG and mG. These results indicated that efficient Gt activation by rhodopsin, resulting from an optimized active state of rhodopsin, is one of the causes of the high amplification efficiency of rods.",Excluded

Effects of X-ray irradiation to the pituitary and transfrontal hypophysectomy were evaluated on the responsiveness of plasma growth hormone (GH) to exogenous stimuli in 8 patients with acromegaly. As exogenous stimuli, arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa were administered. In 2 out of 3 patients treated with Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine was essentially unchanged, while in the third patient positive response to arginine disappeared after therapy. Of 2 patients who received a combination of hypophysectomy and Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa did not change in 1 patient, but in the other it was observed that negative response to L-dopa became positive after the treatment, remaining the unchanged responsiveness to arginine, TRH, and LH-RH. In 3 hypophysectomized patients, little change in responses to the above 4 stimuli was observed. In summary, out of 22 pairs of responses (pre- and post-therapy) examined 20 were not altered. In 11 pairs of responses (pre- and post-irradiation) particularly, 10 were essentially unchanged. It might be concluded that the responsiveness of GH to exogenous stimuli in acromegalics would not be affected by irradiation or transfrontal hypophysectomy.",Excluded

3285,"Chromosome end associations, telomeres and telomerase activity in ataxia telangiectasia cells. Cells derived from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) show enhanced spontaneous levels of chromosomal abnormalities and are sensitive to ionizing radiations and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberration frequencies at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. The higher base line frequencies of chromosome aberrations in part involve chromosome end-to-end associations as seen at metaphase. Since telomeres of tumor cells and aging tissues are often reduced in length, chromosome end associations may be due to loss of telomeric repeats. We studied the chromosome behavior and telomeres of two ataxia telangiectasia lymphoblastoid cell lines compared to two normal control cell lines. The ataxia telangiectasia cell lines showed higher frequencies of chromosome end associations both at metaphase and in interphase, determined in prematurely condensed chromosomes of G1 and G2 cells. They also showed higher frequencies of chromosomal breaks at metaphase and fewer telomeric signals determined using fluorescent in situ hybridization with a (TTAGGG)n probe. The frequency of telomeric repeats was variable in the ataxia telangiectasia cell lines (4.3 and 8.2 kb) compared to the normal cell lines (9.6 and 12 kb) and an inverse correlation between telomere length and chromosome end associations was observed. Both ataxia telangiectasia cell lines showed more robust telomerase activity than the normal cell lines, precluding defective enzymatic capacity as the basis for the chromosome end associations. It is possible that chromatin structure in the form of telomere-nuclear matrix interactions are variant in ataxia telangiectasia cells negatively influencing telomerase function and contributing to telomere associations.",Excluded
640,"Risk of cerebral metastases and neurological death after pathological complete response to neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer: Clinical implications for the subsequent management of the brain. BACKGROUND. The incidence and pattern of brain metastases was analyzed among patients who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS. Between 1990 and 2004, 211 patients were treated with neoadjuvant therapy before surgical resection for stage III NSCLC. The clinical course of 51 patients who demonstrated a pCR were reviewed. The neoadjuvant regimen consisted of either chemotherapy (29 patients) or chemoradiotherapy (22 patients). Histology was 45% adenocarcinoma, 41% squamous cell, and 14% large cell carcinoma. No patient received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). RESULTS. Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82%, 63%, and 42%, respectively. The most common site of initial recurrence was the brain. Twenty-two (43%) patients developed brain metastasis as the site of first failure, which represented 71% of all isolated recurrences. Ultimately, 28 (55%) patients developed brain metastases at some point during their clinical course. The 5-year estimates of brain metastasis-free survival for patients with squamous and nonsquamous cancers were 57% and 34%, respectively (P = .02). Median survival from the time of brain metastasis was 10 and 5 months for those with isolated and nonisolated recurrences, respectively. CONCLUSION. Patients with a pCR after multimodality therapy for locally advanced NSCLC are at excessively high risk for the subsequent development of brain metastases. Implications for management strategies including PCI and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are discussed. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
608,"Low-dose radiation hypersensitivity in human tumor cell lines: effects of cell-cell contact and nutritional deprivation. The hyper-radiosensitivity at low doses recently observed in vitro in a number of cell lines is thought to have important implications for improving tumor radiotherapy. However, cell-cell contact and the cellular environment influence cellular radiosensitivity at higher doses, and they may alter hyper-radiosensitivity in vivo. To confirm this supposition, we investigated the effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on low-dose hypersensitivity in vitro. Cell survival in the low-dose range (3 cGy to 2 Gy) was studied in cells of two human glioma (BMG-1 and U-87) and two human oral squamous carcinoma (PECA-4451 and PECA-4197) lines using a conventional macrocolony assay. The effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance were studied in cells of the BMG-1 cell line, which showed prominent hypersensitivity and induced radioresistance. The induction of growth inhibition, cell cycle delay, micronuclei and apoptosis was also studied at the hyper-radiosensitivity-inducing low doses. Hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance was evident in the cells of all four cell lines to varying extents, with maximum sensitivity at 10-30 cGy, followed by an increase in survival up to 50 cGy-1 Gy. Both the glioma cell lines had more prominent hyper-radiosensitivity than the two squamous carcinoma cell lines. Low doses inducing maximum hyper-radiosensitivity did not cause significant growth inhibition, micronucleation or apoptosis in BMG-1 cells, but a transient G(1)/S-phase block was evident. Irradiating and incubating BMG-1 cells at high density for 0 or 4 h before plating, as well as irradiating cells as microcolonies, reduced hyper-radiosensitivity significantly, indicating the role of cell-cell contact-mediated processes. Liquid holding of BMG-1 cells in HBSS + 1% serum during and after irradiation for 4 h significantly reduced hyper-radiosensitivity, suggesting that hyper-radiosensitivity may be due partly to active damage fixation processes at low doses. Therefore, our findings suggest that the damage-induced signaling mechanisms influenced by (or mediated through) cell-cell contact or the cellular environment, as well as the lesion fixation processes, play an important role in hyper-radiosensitivity. Further studies are required to determine the exact nature of the damage that triggers these responses as well as for evaluating the potential of low-dose therapy.",Excluded
752,"Paired associative stimulation. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) refers to a paradigm consisting of slow-rate repetitive low-frequency median nerve stimulation combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex. This protocol has been shown to induce plastic changes of excitability in the human motor cortex. Its principles of design were shaped after associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in experimental animals, a cellular mechanism likely to be relevant for learning and memory. PAS-induced changes of cortical excitability share a number of physiological properties with LTP. Of particular importance is the fact that the sign of PAS-induced changes of the size of amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) depends on the exact interval between the afferent and the magnetic pulse during the intervention. A number of observations suggest that PAS-induced excitability changes may have functional significance. PAS-induced plasticity may contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of neurological disorders where neuroplasticity is thought to have a pathogenetic role. Finally, PAS-induced plasticity may itself have therapeutic potential. [References: 16]",Excluded

791,"The neuronal transfer function: contributions from voltage- and time-dependent mechanisms. The discovery that an array of voltage- and time-dependent channels is present in both the dendrites and soma of neurons has led to a variety of models for single-neuron computation. Most of these models, however, are based on experimental techniques that use simplified inputs of either single synaptic events or brief current injections. In this study, we used a more complex time-varying input to mimic the continuous barrage of synaptic input that neurons are likely to receive in vivo. Using dual whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons, we injected long-duration white-noise current into the dendrites. The amplitude variance of this stimulus was adjusted to produce either low subthreshold or high suprathreshold fluctuations of the somatic membrane potential. Somatic action potentials were produced in the high variance input condition. Applying a rigorous system-identification approach, we discovered that the neuronal input/output function was extremely well described by a model containing a linear bandpass filter followed by a nonlinear static-gain. Using computer models, we found that a range of voltage-dependent channel properties can readily account for the experimentally observed filtering in the neuronal input/output function. In addition, the bandpass signal processing of the neuronal input/output function was determined by the time-dependence of the channels. A simple active channel, however, could not account for the experimentally observed change in gain. These results suggest that nonlinear voltage- and time-dependent channels contribute to the linear filtering of the neuronal input/output function and that channel kinetics shape temporal signal processing in dendrites.

Exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. However, little is focused on the effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we studied the potential effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neural stem cells (eNSCs). We exposed eNSCs to ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 1, 2, and 3 days with 4 hours per day. We found that eNSC proliferation and maintenance were significantly enhanced after ELF-EMF exposure in proliferation medium. ELF-EMF exposure increased the ratio of differentiated neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth of eNSC-derived neurons without influencing astrocyes differentiation and the cell apoptosis. In addition, the expression of the proneural genes, NeuroD and Ngn1, which are crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, was increased after ELF-EMF exposure. Moreover, the expression of transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) was significantly up-regulated accompanied by increased the peak amplitude of intracellular calcium level induced by ELF-EMF. Furthermore, silencing TRPC1 expression eliminated the up-regulation of the proneural genes and the promotion of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth induced by ELF-EMF. These results suggest that ELF-EMF exposure promotes the neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of eNSCs via up-regulation the expression of TRPC1 and proneural genes (NeuroD and Ngn1). These findings also provide new insights in understanding the effects of ELF-EMF exposure on embryonic brain development.",Excluded

First, wave propagation simulations through the intact mouse skull revealed minimal beam distortion while thermal deposition simulations, at the same sonication parameters used to induce BBB opening in vivo, revealed temperature increases lower than 0.5 degrees C. The simulation results were validated experimentally in ex vivo skulls (m = 6) and in vitro tissue specimens.

Sequential, high-resolution, T1-weighted MRI (9.4 Tesla, in-plane resolution: 75 microm, scan time: 45-180 min) with gadolinium (Omniscan; 0.5 ml) injected intraperitoneally revealed a threshold of the BBB opening at 0.67 MPa and BBB closing within 28 h from opening.

Sonicated arteries, or their immediate surroundings, depicted greater contrast enhancement than sonicated homogeneous brain tissue regions. In conclusion, gadolinium was delivered through a transiently opened BBB and contained to a specific brain region (i.e., the hippocampus) using a single-element focused ultrasound transducer. It was also found that the amount of gadolinium deposited in the hippocampal region increased with the acoustic pressure and that the spatial distribution of the BBB opening was determined not only by the ultrasound beam, but also by the vasculature of the targeted brain region.",Excluded

The need for an effective noninvasive tool to ablate spinal lesions reflects the limitations of traditional surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches. Open surgery is invasive and carries a risk of neurological injury and vertebral column dysfunction. Conventional radiotherapy often has poor clinical efficacy and a risk of neurologic complications. Spinal radiosurgery has been developed to overcome these limitations. This technique consists of precise delivery of high-dose radiation to a spinal target. To spare the delicate and radiation-sensitive spinal cord and to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications, it is essential that the radiation dose decreases rapidly outside of the target. This is accomplished by use of advanced, image-guidance technology, treatment planning software, and robotics. Preliminary data indicate that this approach can achieve high rates of tumor control of spinal and paraspinal lesions and durable reduction of associated vertebral pain without neurological complications. Although spinal radiosurgery is not yet widely practiced, the benefits of this new therapeutic approach are likely to encourage its widespread adoption in coming years.",Excluded

Presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2, respectively) play a critical role in mediating gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Numerous mutations in the presenilins are known to cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In addition, it is well established that PS1 deficiency leads to altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis involving endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. However, there has been little evidence suggesting Ca(2+) signals from extracellular sources are influenced by PS1. Here we report that the Ca(2+) currents carried by voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are increased in PS1-deficient cortical neurons. This increase is mediated by a significant increase in the contributions of L- and P-type Ca(2+) channels to the total voltage-mediated Ca(2+) conductance in PS1 (-/-) neurons. In addition, chelating intracellular Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) produced an increase in Ca(2+) current amplitude that was comparable to the increase caused by PS1 deficiency. In contrast to this, BAPTA had no effect on voltage-dependent Ca(2+) conductances in PS1-deficient neurons. These data suggest that PS1 deficiency may influence voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel function by means that involve intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. These findings reveal that PS1 functions at multiple levels to regulate and stabilize intracellular Ca(2+) levels that ultimately control neuronal firing behavior and influence synaptic transmission.",Excluded

3921,"Direct regulation of CREB transcriptional activity by ATM in response to genotoxic stress. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a syndrome of cancer susceptibility, immune dysfunction, and neurodegeneration that is caused by mutations in the A-T-mutated (ATM) gene. ATM has been implicated as a critical regulator of cellular responses to DNA damage, including the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and induction of apoptosis. Although defective cell cycle-checkpoint regulation and associated genomic instability presumably contribute to cancer susceptibility in A-T, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in A-T is not well understood. In addition, although ATM is required for the induction of the p53 transcriptional program in response to DNA damage, the identities of the relevant transcription factors that mediate ATM-dependent changes in gene expression remain largely undetermined. In this article, we describe a signal transduction pathway linking ATM directly to the Ca(2+)/cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB, a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, homeostasis, and survival. ATM phosphorylated CREB in vitro and in vivo in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and H(2)O(2) on a stress-inducible domain. IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB correlated with a decrease in CREB transactivation potential and reduced interaction between CREB and its transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). A CREB mutant containing Ala substitutions at ATM phosphorylation sites displayed enhanced transactivation potential, resistance to inhibition by IR, and increased binding to CBP. We propose that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of CREB in response to DNA damage modulates CREB-dependent gene expression and that dysregulation of the ATM-CREB pathway may contribute to neurodegeneration in A-T.",Excluded

To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study analyzing this technique. The evaluation is performed for 1.5 T MR scanners using a generic model of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) with a straight lead and a helical lead. The results show that the approach is technically feasible and provides sound and conservative information about the potential heating of implants. We demonstrate that (1) applying optimized tools results in reasonable uncertainties for the overall evaluation; (2) each tier reduces the overestimation by several dB at the cost of more demanding evaluation steps; (3) the implant with the straight lead would cause local temperature increases larger than 18 degreeC at the RF exposure limit for the normal operating mode; (4) Tier 3 is not sufficient for the helical implant; and (5) Tier 4 might be too demanding to be performed for complex implants. We conclude with a suggestion for a procedure that follows the same concept but is between Tier 3 and 4. In addition, the evaluation of Tier 3 has shown consistency with current scan practice, namely, the resulting heat at the lead tip is less than 3.5 degreeC for the straight lead and 0.7 degreeC for the helix lead for scans at the current applied MR scan restrictions for deep brain stimulation at a head average SAR of 0.1 W/kg.",Excluded

The vestibular schwannomas of 5 patients were associated with type II neurofibromatosis. The median follow-up time was 80 months (range: 6-167); the median planning target volume was 2.6 cm(3) (0.3-15.4); and the median prescribed dose (>=D90) was 21 Gy in three fractions (18-25 Gy in three to five fractions). Progression was defined as >=2 mm 3-dimensional post-treatment tumor enlargement excluding transient expansion. Progression or any death was counted as an event in progression-free survival rates, whereas only progression was counted in progression-free rates.RESULTS: The 7-year progression-free survival and progression-free rates were 78 and 95%, respectively. Late adverse events (>=3 months) with grades based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03 were observed in 6 patients: Grade 3 hydrocephalus in one patient, Grade 2 facial nerve disorders in two and Grade 1-2 tinnitus in three.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling indexes (PCNA-LI) in the colon epithelium were essentially the same in MF-treated and control rats. Histopathological examination showed evident hemorrhage in the pituitary glands of some rats of groups 1-3, and in most rats of group 4. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed ultrastructural changes, but DNA ploidy analysis revealed no carcinogenicity to MF-exposed pituitary glands. Serum levels of AST, ALT, total protein, creatinine, albumin, albumin/globulin ratio and growth hormone levels did not change among the groups. The present study revealed that the action of an artificial MF on rats is not carcinogenic/or cancer-promoting, at least in the present protocol for colon carcinogenesis.",Excluded
591,"Magnetic-resonance imaging for kinetic analysis of permeability changes during focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening and brain drug delivery. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with the presence of microbubbles has been shown to induce transient and local opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the delivery of therapeutic molecules which normally cannot penetrate into the brain. The success of FUS brain-drug delivery relies on its integration with in-vivo imaging to monitor kinetic change of therapeutic molecules into the brain. In this study, we developed a dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique for kinetic analysis of delivered molecules during FUS-BBB opening. Three kinetic parameters (K<inf>trans</inf>, V<inf>e</inf>, K<inf>ep</inf>) were characterized dynamically to describe BBB-permeability at two FUS exposure conditions (0.4 or 0.8 MPa) over 24 h. K<inf>trans</inf>, defined as the influx volume transfer constant from plasma to EES, and V<inf>e</inf>, the EES volume fraction, were both found to be pressure-dependent. K<inf>trans</inf> and V<inf>e</inf> showed a peak increase of 0.0086-0.0131 min<sup>- 1</sup> (for 0.4-0.8 MPa pressure), and 0.0431-0.0692, respectively, immediately after FUS exposure. Both parameters subsequently decreased exponentially as a function of time, with estimated half-lives of decay of 2.89-5.3 and 2.2-4.93 h, respectively. The kinetics of K<inf>ep</inf>, defined as the efflux rate constant from the extracellular extravascular space (EES) to the plasma, were complementary to K <inf>trans</inf>, with an initial decrease from 0.2010 to 0.1901 min <sup>- 1</sup> followed by a significantly longer recovery time (half-life of 17.39-99.92 h). Our observations strongly supported the existence of imbalanced and mismatched kinetics of influx (K<inf>trans</inf>) and efflux (K <inf>ep</inf>) between the plasma and EES, indicating the existence of directional permeability during FUS-BBB opening. We further showed that kinetic change determined by DCE-MRI correlated well with the concentration of Evans Blue (EB)-albumin (coefficient of 0.74-0.89). These findings suggest that MRI kinetic monitoring may serve as an alternative method for in-vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) change of therapeutic agents during drug delivery to the brain, and provide useful information for future optimization of FUS-BBB opening. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

97,"Temperature dependence of radiation-induced DNA-protein crosslinks formed under hypoxic conditions. Recently, we demonstrated that the oxygen dependence of the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in irradiated mammalian cells measured by the alkaline elution technique is the mirror image of the oxygen dependence of radiation-induced cell killing. Consequently, these radiation-induced DPCs could be used to detect hypoxic cells or estimate the hypoxic fraction of cells in solid tumors. Although several techniques, including alkaline elution, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nitrocellulose filter binding, have been used to measure radiation-induced DPCs, the published reports suggest that the characteristics of these DPCs may depend on both the type of sample irradiated (cellular compared to model systems, oxygenated compared to hypoxic, etc.) and the technique used to measure these radiation-induced DPCs. In the present study, the radiation-induced DPCs measured by our alkaline elution technique with and without proteinase K in the lysis solution were characterized by studying the dependence of their formation on temperature in hypoxic rat 9L brain tumor cells. Exponentially growing 9L rat brain tumor cells were rendered hypoxic at 4degreeC or at 37degreeC and then irradiated with either 7.5 Gy or 15 Gy. The cells were trypsinized at 4degreeC, either immediately after the irradiation or after one half-time of strand break repair at 37degreeC. The results demonstrated that the radiation- induced DPCs produced in 9L cells under hypoxic conditions, measured by our alkaline elution technique after low to moderate radiation doses, required metabolism for their formation, unlike the radiation-induced DPCs reported by others using the GC/MS or nitrocellulose filter binding technique.",Excluded

Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) codes: 430-438] was studied in a cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1982 and followed up to the end of 2008. The cohort size was increased by 19% and follow-up extended by 3 years over the previous analysis. Radiation doses were estimated using an updated dosimetry system: Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time, in an analysis of this cohort, quantitative smoking data were used. Workers of the study cohort were exposed occupationally to prolonged external gamma rays and internal alpha particles. The mean (+/-standard deviation) total dose from external gamma rays was 0.54 +/- 0.76 Gy (95% percentile 2.21 Gy) for males and 0.44 +/- 0.65 Gy (95% percentile 1.87 Gy) for females. The mean plutonium body burden in the 31% of workers monitored for internal exposure was 1.32 +/- 4.87 kBq (95% percentile 4.71 kBq) for males and 2.21 +/- 13.24 kBq (95% percentile 4.56 kBq) for females. The mean total absorbed alpha-particles dose to the liver from incorporated plutonium was 0.23 +/- 0.77 Gy (95% percentile 0.89 Gy) in males and 0.44 +/- 2.11 Gy (95% percentile 1.25 Gy) in females. After adjusting for nonradiation factors (gender, age, calendar period, employment period, facility, smoking, alcohol consumption), there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence associated with total absorbed dose from external gamma rays and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal alpha-particle radiation exposure. Excess relative risks per Gy (ERR/Gy) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.37, 0.57) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16, 0.42), respectively, based on a linear dose-response model. Adjustments for additional factors (hypertension, body mass index, duration of employment, smoking index and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal exposure during the analysis of external exposure and vice versa) had little effect on the results. The categorical analyses showed that CVD incidence was significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses and that CVD incidence was also significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-particle doses to the liver from incorporated plutonium greater than 0.01 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. The results of the categorical analyses of CVD incidence were in good agreement with a linear dose response for external gamma-ray doses but for internal alpha-particle doses the picture was less clear. For the first time an excess risk of CVD mortality was seen in workers whose livers were exposed to internal alpha-particle doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those workers who were exposed to doses of less than 0.01 Gy. A significant increasing trend for CVD mortality with internal alpha-particle dose was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed at doses <1.0 Gy after having adjusted for nonradiation factors, ERR/Gy = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.09, 1.92). These updated results provide good evidence for a linear trend in risk of CVD incidence with external gamma-ray dose. The trend for CVD incidence with internal alpha-particle dose is less clear due to the impact of issues concerning the use of dose estimates based on below the limit of detection bioassay measurements.",Included

Changes in the intensity of ascorbate- and NADPN2-dependent induced lipid peroxidation (LPO) were studied in exposure of the visual analyzer and hypothalamus of 3- and 12-month-old rats to radiation with microwaves of high and low intensity. The exposure to microwaves of high intensity stimulated basal LPO but suppressed activity of LPO-inducing systems. This suggests disturbances in the activity of different sources of active oxygen forms. Microwaves of low intensity activated systems of induced LPO. This is accompanied with synchronous activity of the antioxidant defense system maintaining a normal oxidation-reduction balance of the cell. The conclusion is that, depending on their intensity, microwaves can be either beneficial to health or be a factor of oxidative stress.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Lower limb lymphedema (LLL) is a common condition after pelvic cancer treatment but few studies have evaluated its effect on the quality of life and its consequences on daily life activities among gynecological cancer survivors.METHODS: We identified a cohort of 789 eligible women, treated with pelvic radiotherapy alone or as part of combined treatment of gynecological cancer, from 1991 to 2003 at two departments of gynecological oncology in Sweden. As a preparatory study, we conducted in-depth interviews with gynecological cancer survivors and constructed a study-specific questionnaire which we validated face-to-face. The questionnaire covered physical symptoms originating in the pelvis, demographic, psychological, and quality of life factors. In relation to the lymph system, 19 questions were asked.RESULTS: Six hundred sixteen (78 %) gynecological cancer survivors answered the questionnaire and participated in the study. Thirty-six percent (218/606) of the cancer survivors reported LLL. Overall quality of life was significantly lower among cancer survivors with LLL. They were also less satisfied with their sleep, more worried about recurrence of cancer, and more likely to interpret symptoms from the body as recurrence. Cancer survivors reported that LLL kept them from physical activity (45 %) and house work (29 %) and affected their ability to partake in social activities (27 %) or to meet friends (20 %).CONCLUSION: Lower limb lymphedema has a negative impact on quality of life among gynecological cancer survivors, affecting sleep and daily life activities, yet only a few seek professional help.",Excluded

3347,"Hitting a moving target: evolution of a treatment paradigm for atypical meningiomas amid changing diagnostic criteria. OBJECT: The World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified atypical meningiomas in 2000, creating a more clear and broadly accepted definition. In this paper, the authors evaluated the pathological and clinical transition period for atypical meningiomas according to the implementation of the new WHO grading system at their institution. METHOD(S): A total of 471 meningiomas occurring in 440 patients between 1994 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed to determine changes in diagnostic rates, postoperative treatment trends, and early outcomes. RESULT(S): Between 1994 and 2000, the incidence of the atypical meningiomas ranged from 0 to 3/year, or 4.4% of the meningiomas detected during the entire period. After 2002, the annual percentage of atypical meningiomas rose over a 2-year period, leveling off at between 32.7 and 35.5% between 2004 and 2006. The authors also found a recent trend toward increased use of adjuvant radiation therapy for incompletely resected atypical meningiomas. Prior to 2003, 18.7% were treated with this therapy; after 2003, 34.4% of lesions received this treatment. Incompletely resected tumors were treated with some form of radiation 76% of the time. In cases of complete resection, most patients were not given adjuvant therapy but were expectantly managed by close monitoring using serial imaging and by receiving immediate treatment for tumor recurrence. The overall recurrence rate for expectantly managed tumors was 9% over 28.2 months, and 75% of recurrences responded to delayed radiation therapy. CONCLUSION(S): The authors documented a significant change in the proportion of meningiomas designated as atypical during a transition period from 2002 to 2004, and propose a conservative strategy for the use of radiation therapy in atypical meningiomas.",Excluded

Multivariable analysis was conducted with use of a Cox proportional hazards model and a stepwise selection algorithm that used p < 0.10 as the criteria for entry and p < 0.05 as retention in the model to identify independent predictors of survival. RESULT(S): Chart records of 478patients (54% of whom were men) diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 41 years (range, 18-83 years).42% of patients had biopsy only, 27% had gross total resection, 6% had near. total resection, and 25% had subtotal resection. 22% of patients were initially treated with radiation, 30% with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 7% with concurrent chemotherapy. Median progression free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 5.1 years and 12.8 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, independent of additional therapy, five factors were identified as independent predictors of OS: age at diagnosis (p = 0.002), Karnofsky performance status (KPS, p < 0.0001), histology (astrocytoma vs. other, p = 0.001), hemispheric location (left or bilateral involvement vs. right, p = 0.02) and gender (male vs. female, p = 0.0003).

In this study, the effect of exposure to 900 and 1800 MHz GSM-like radiofrequency radiation upon the urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6SM) excretion of adult male Wistar rats was studied. Seventy-two rats were used in six independent experiments, three of which were done with 900 MHz and the other three with 1800 MHz. The exposures were performed in a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic mode (GTEM) cell. The power densities of radiation were 100 and 20 microW/cm(2) at 900 and 1800 MHz frequency, respectively. The carrier frequency was modulated with 218 Hz, as in the GSM signal. The animals were exposed for 2 h between 8:00 AM and noon daily during the 14 day exposure period. The urine of rats was collected from 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM, collecting from exposed and control animal groups on alternate days. The urinary 6SM concentration was measured by (125)I radioimmunoassay and was referred to creatinine.

1193,"Neuroprotective effects of a new skin care formulation following ultraviolet exposure. Background: Chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure is a major environmental factor involved in extrinsic skin ageing (photo-ageing). Skin nerve fibres are significantly reduced in number following UV irradiation and new skincare compounds with neuroprotective effects are thus highly warranted. Objective(s): We developed a new skincare formulation from a plant extract and evaluated its neuroprotective effects of ex vivo UV irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): The new skincare emulsion was formulated from Echinacea purpurea extract and was enriched with antioxidants (patent no. PROV020110087075). Skin samples were obtained from 20 healthy patients enrolled for plastic surgery and were immediately treated with placebo (SPF 15) or test emulsions. Skin samples were exposed to UVA and UVB for 60min. Nerve fibres were identified by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody, anti-human CD56. Cell damage was quantified by image analysis. Result(s): UVA and UVB significantly reduced (40-60%) densities of nerve endings in control samples treated with placebo (P<0.001). Samples treated with test emulsion completely blocked UV-related effects on skin nerve endings. These neuroprotective effects were similarly observed regardless of age or tissue analysed (breast versus abdomen).

2309,"The influence of fibroblast on the arachnoid leptomeningeal cells in vitro. OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast is pervasive in the setting of injury. Its invasion into the arachnoid tissue causes scarring, cortical adhesion of the brain, and obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow. The purpose of this study is to determine the phenotypic and physiologic effects of fibroblasts on arachnoid in culture.METHODS: We studied the effects of fibroblast on the arachnoid cell growth, motility, phenotypic changes, and transport properties. Immortalized rat (Rattus norvegicus, Sprague Dawley breed) arachnoid cells were grown with fibroblast on opposite sides of polyethylene membranes or co-cultured in plastic wells. Arachnoid cell growth rate and DNA content, morphology, transport physiology, and extracellular matriceal content were determined in the presence of normal and irradiated fibroblast cells.RESULTS: When arachnoid cells were grown in the presence of fibroblasts, mannitol permeability increased and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) decreased. Arachnoid cell growth rate also significantly decreased. When arachnoid cells were grown in close proximity (i.e. on the same monolayer) with fibroblasts, the arachnoid cells were overrun by day 2, yet when physically separated, no significant change was seen in growth. Apoptosis increased markedly in arachnoid cultures in the presence of fibroblast. Fibroblast caused arachnoid cell to exhibit avoidance behavior, and irradiated fibroblast induced arachnoidal cells to move faster and exhibited greater directional changes. Subcellular glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was significantly altered by fibroblast.INTERPRETATION: Fibroblasts influence arachnoid cell's mannitol transport likely via soluble factors. While the arachnoid cells did not change morphologically, cell growth was influenced. Over time, the cells had profound changes in transport and motility. The immortalized arachnoid cell/fibroblast culture system provides a unique model mimicking the pathologic event of leptomeningeal scarring.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate a prospectively initiated two-center protocol of risk-adapted stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with acromegaly.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total 35 patients (16 men/19 women, mean age 54 years) were prospectively included in a treatment protocol of SRS [planning target volume (PTV < 4 ccm, > 2 mm to optic pathways = low risk] or SRT (PTV >= 4 ccm, <= 2 mm to optic pathways = high risk). The mean tumor volume was 3.71 ccm (range: 0.11-22.10 ccm). Based on the protocol guidelines, 21 patients were treated with SRS and 12 patients with SRT, 2 patients received both consecutively.RESULTS: The median follow-up (FU) reached 8 years with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 87.3% [confidence interval (CI): 70.8-95.6%] and 5-year local control rate of 97.1% (CI: 83.4-99.8%). Almost 80% (28/35) presented tumor shrinkage during FU. Endocrinological cure was achieved in 23% and IGF-1 normalization with reduced medication was achieved in 40% of all patients. An endocrinological response was generally achieved within the first 3 years, but endocrinological cure can require more than 8 years. A new adrenocorticotropic hypopituitarism occurred in 13 patients (46.4%). A new visual field disorder and a new oculomotor palsy occurred in 1 patient, respectively. Patients with occurrence of visual/neurological impairments had a longer FU (p = 0.049).CONCLUSION: Our SRS/SRT protocol proved to be safe and successful in terms of tumor control and protection of the visual system.

648,"Characterization of structurally distinct, isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors in combination with radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma. The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in fundamental cellular functions important in normal cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation.",Excluded

1241,"Intraspecific variation in retinal cone distribution in the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei. Studies of visual ecology have typically focused on differences among species while paying less attention to variation among populations and/or individuals. Here, we show that the relative abundance of UV, violet, yellow, and red cones varies between two populations of bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei. Animals from a spring population (high-transmission UV/blue light) have a higher frequency of UV and violet cones and a lower frequency of yellow and red cones than animals from a swamp population (low-transmission UV/blue light). Visual sensitivity does not vary significantly between the populations, but spring animals tend to be more sensitive in the UV/blue wavelengths (360-440 nm) and less sensitive in longer wavelengths (560-600 nm) than swamp animals. The results have two important implications. First, the tight conservation of functional regions of opsin genes across taxa does not imply that visual systems are constrained in their evolution; differential sensitivity can arise through differential expression of cone classes within the retina. Second, intraspecific visual signals in this species may evolve to maximize contrast between the signaler and the background (as opposed to brightness); males with blue anal fins are most abundant in swamp habitats where animals express fewer UV and violet cones.",Excluded

Purpose: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid therapy for grade 1/2 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). Although a median progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 20 months is frequently observed, the majority of patients relapse after 2 - 3 years. In the present study, we investigated the use of low dosage re-treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE (Lu-PRRT) in patients with GEP-NENs who relapsed after treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC (Y-PRRT). Method(s): Upon tumour progression, 26 patients with a PFS of at least 12 months after Y-PRRT were consecutively enrolled in a phase II study of re-treatment with Lu-PRRT. All patients had preserved kidney and haematological parameters and received 14.8 - 18.5 GBq of Lu-PRRT in four or five cycles. The disease control rate (DCR), toxicity, PFS and prognostic factors were evaluated. Result(s): Median total activity of Lu-PRRT was 16.5 GBq in five cycles. The DCR was 84.6 %, median PFS was 22 months (95 % CI 16 months - not reached) compared to 28 months (95 % CI 20 - 36 months) after Y-PRRT. Tumour burden and number of liver metastases were important prognostic factors. Toxicity was mild after Lu-PRRT re-treatment in the majority of patients, with only two patients with grade 2 and one with grade 3 bone marrow toxicity; one patient had grade 2 and one grade 3 renal toxicity. Conclusion(s): Patients with GEP-NEN who have previously responded to Y-PRRT are suitable candidates for Lu-PRRT re-treatment on progression. Although our sample size was limited, low-dosage Lu-PRRT was safe, and led to DCR and PFS rates comparable with those observed when Y-PRRT was used as primary treatment.

Present study highlighted the ultramicroscopic (SEM) alterations of the skin, eye, barbel, and fins of spawn of an air-breathing teleost (Clarias batrachus, Linn. 1758) induced by UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) at a dose (@4.07 x 10<sup>-20</sup>J/photon/m<sup>2</sup>) under the time-frame of 5, 10 and 15 min/d in the laboratory condition for the periods of 5 and 10 days. Limnological parameters revealed no significant changes throughout the period of experimentation which were measured by PCS Testr 35 Multi-Parameter. Morphometric analysis revealed that during the extended exposure period of 10 days the spawn size and weight were reduced as analysed through Specific Growth Rate (SGR). SGR values in terms of weight for 5 and 10 days under 3 time-frames were 17.12%, 12.52%, 11.46% and 9.09%, 6.43%, 6.09% respectively, which revealed a declined trend along with the exposure days. In the skin of C. batrachus, the compact regular orientation of the stratified epithelial cells and mucous cells became distorted and the microridges and double-ridged structures showed destruction and fragmentations. The body striations and microfolds became shrinked and swollen and finally degenerated to form a mass. The distribution of mucous cells throughout the epidermis was disorganised and releasing secretory contents on the surface through small pores. Appearance of huge quantity of biogenic semi-hexagonal plate like crystals (guanine platelets) on the skin surface of the body was the most significant observations during UV-B radiation.

500,"C-Jun N-terminal kinase regulates adenosine A1 receptor-mediated synaptic depression in the rat hippocampus. Adenosine A1 receptors are ubiquitous mediators of presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmission in the central nervous system, yet the signalling pathway linking A1 receptor activation and decreased neurotransmitter release remains poorly resolved. We tested the contribution of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to adenosine A1 receptor-mediated depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus. We found that inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or JNK inhibitor V, but not an inactive analogue, attenuated the depression of fEPSPs induced by adenosine, hypoxia, and the A1 receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). In contrast, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not inhibit GABA(B)-mediated synaptic depression. In support of our electrophysiological findings, Western blot analysis showed that A1 receptor stimulation resulted in a transient increase in JNK phosphorylation in the membrane fraction of hippocampal lysates. The total amount of JNK in the membrane fraction was unchanged by CPA treatment. The increase in phosphorylated JNK induced by A1 receptor stimulation was blocked by the A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), indicating that A1 receptors specifically activate JNK in the hippocampus. Together with functional data indicating that JNK inhibition decreased CPA-induced paired pulse facilitation, these results suggest that JNK activation is necessary for adenosine A1 receptor-mediated synaptic depression occurring at a presynaptic locus The adenosine A1 receptor-JNK signalling pathway may represent a novel mechanism underlying inhibition of neurotransmitter release in the CNS.",Excluded
3350,"Visual impairment and intracranial dysgerminomas. Purpose/Objective: Dysgerminomas are usually located initially on midline. Localization to optic pathways (OP) have been described. We assessed the incidence of such localization. Material(s) and Method(s): A blinded central retrospective review of initial imaging and charts of 28 patients with intracranial germinomas was performed. 13 were pineal, 12 supraoptic (7 bifocal), 1 optic nerve, 1 corpus callosum and 1 brainstem. Result(s): Among 11 patients that complained of decreased visual acuity (DVA), 6 did not have signs of intracranial pressure: 5 of them had an invasion of OP. Two had normal fundi, 3 abnormal fundi. Three had a supraoptic mass with contiguous involvement of the chiasma. Another patient had DVA and endocrinological symptoms. The MRI showed pineal tumor. Biopsy revealed a germinoma. CSF bHCG were raised (90UI/L). This ""bifocal"" ""secreting' tumor was treated with chemotherapy and focal radiation on both primaries. He relapsed with a diffuse ventricular and meningeal dissemination. The review showed that the thickening of optic nerves with contrast enhancement was overlooked, and optic nerve wasn't included in the radiation field. The last patient had DVA. The MRI showed a chiasmatic and optic nerve tumor. Among the 8 other patients with supraoptic germinoma and the 15 patients with others locations, 6 had DVA. Patients with abnormal fundi and/or DVA all had intracranial hypertension. MRI showed no involvement of OP. Conclusion(s): Optic pathways involvement of germinoma is not rare and should be discussed in case of thickening of OP. DVA may be secondary to intracranial hypertension and/or to OP invasion. MRI exploring visual pathway is mandatory to adapt radiotherapy in any doubtful case.",Excluded

3468,"Disorder in Pixel-Level Edge Directions on T1WI Is Associated with the Degree of Radiation Necrosis in Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: Preliminary Findings. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (COLLAGE) is a recently developed radiomic (computer extracted) feature that captures entropy (measures the degree of disorder) in pixel-level edge directions and was previously shown to distinguish predominant cerebral radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor on gadolinium-contrast T1WI. In this work, we sought to investigate whether COLLAGE measurements from posttreatment gadolinium-contrast T1WI could distinguish varying extents of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor classes in a lesion across primary and metastatic brain tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: On a total of 75 gadolinium-contrast T1WI studies obtained from patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the extent of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor in every brain lesion was histopathologically defined by an expert neuropathologist as the following: 1) ""pure"" cerebral radiation necrosis; 2) ""mixed"" pathology with coexistence of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumors; 3) ""predominant"" (>80%) cerebral radiation necrosis; 4) predominant (>80%) recurrent tumor; and 5) pure tumor. COLLAGE features were extracted from the expert-annotated ROIs on MR imaging. Statistical comparisons of COLLAGE measurements using first-order statistics were performed across pure, mixed, and predominant pathologies of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: COLLAGE features exhibited decreased skewness for patients with pure (0.15 +/- 0.12) and predominant cerebral radiation necrosis (0.25 +/- 0.09) and were statistically significantly different (P < .05) from those in patients with predominant recurrent tumors, which had highly skewed (0.42 +/- 0.21) COLLAGE values. COLLAGE values for the mixed pathology studies were found to lie between predominant cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor categories.CONCLUSIONS: With additional independent multisite validation, COLLAGE measurements might enable noninvasive characterization of the degree of recurrent tumor or cerebral radiation necrosis in gadolinium-contrast T1WI of posttreatment lesions.",Excluded

172,"Does occupational exposure to argon laser radiation decrease colour contrast sensitivity in UK ophthalmologists?. The objects of the study were to determine: (1) whether United Kingdom ophthalmologists who used argon lasers had the elevation of colour-contrast thresholds previously discovered and (2) whether other users of argon lasers showed any unusual loss of colour vision. A total of 1072 UK ophthalmologists filled in a questionnaire about their professional use of lasers, the length of time spent operating, and their out-of-doors activities. Their colour vision was then tested by a new sensitive system, and if any abnormality was detected, a clinical eye examination was performed. The results were as follows: (1) Colour vision testing was shown to be reliable. Any self-selection bias was excluded. Test-retest variability was small. Normal results did not change during the survey. (2) A number of men with high red-green thresholds were discovered. Some were aware of their congenital insensitivity. The frequency of all such defects was less than the known incidence of congenital colour deficiency in the male population. (3) Additionally a number of high tritan (blue-yellow) thresholds were encountered, some associated with reported diabetes and hypertension. In other cases of this type, undetected or unacknowledged systemic disease may be present. (4) After making allowance for all these incidental causes of loss of colour vision, and for the effect of age on colour vision (which is very small) only four of the sample were > 2 SD above normal. (5) However, the average blue-yellow thresholds of ophthalmologists were slightly and highly significantly raised compared with normal, in the first year of the survey. During the second and third years, the mean thresholds declined to normal. Similar but less significant findings were found for protan thresholds. It is concluded that the enhanced safety precautions recently introduced are associated with a recovery of colour vision in this population, demonstrating that any changes to individuals were reversible. Colour vision screening has proved able to detect mild ocular abnormalities due to systemic and congenital disease.",Excluded
3589,"Cellular response of meningioma towards retinoid acid and ionizing radiation. Meningiomas are the second most common primary brain tumors and represent one-third of all primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Currently, most meninigiomas are effectively managed via surgical resection. Recurrent meningiomas and unresectable, residual tumors after partial resection are treated with radiation. However, patients who are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or whose tumors recur after such treatment have limited therapeutic options. Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA) has been widely used to treat dermatological disease. Recently, RA, the active derivative of vitamin A and the first candidate diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, was used as a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of RA on meningiomas when administered in combinination with ionizing radiation. The early data showed that both all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic aciecan inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations (10 mM) but had little cell proliferation inhibition activity at low concentrations (10 nM and 1 mM, respectively), thereby implicating the role of RA in meningioma clinical treatment. Neither ATRA nor 13-cis-RA influenced cell cycle progression. Further study showed that 10-mM ATRA exposure led to increased cell death after irradiation; however, 10-nM or 1-mMATRA pretreatment enhanced meningioma cell survival following irradiation. Comet assay showed that RA reduced the G2/M phase arrest caused by irradiation, thereby suggesting that DNA repair processes are involved in the activity of RA when combined with radiation.",Excluded
298,"Microstructural white matter correlates of motor fatigue in multiple sclerosis-a diffusion weighted imaging study. Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). It contributes significantly to reduced quality of life. Some studies suggest that fatigue is a consequence of microstructural disease alterations in specific white matter (WM) tracts - e.g., right anterior thalamic radiation (rATR) (Bester 2013, Gobbi 2014). However, others have not been able to find any associations between WM changes and fatigue. Consequently, the role of microstructural WM changes in the pathophysiology of fatigue remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between WM microstructural brain pathology and motor fatigue in MS. Method(s): We included 50 mildly disabled relapsing remitting MS patients from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Centre and 25 age -and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Fatigue was evaluated with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Additionally, all participants underwent a standard MS test-battery and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination including conventional scans and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). i) The local microstructural brain structures were assessed with fractional anisotropy (FA) for detecting the voxelwise indicating indices of WM abnormalities compared to HC. ii) The disruption of neural fibres connecting specific brain areas was assessed with anatomical connectivity mapping (ACM), which reflects the strength of connectedness of each WM voxel to the entire brain (Lyksborg 2014). iii) We also assessed the correlation between fatigue scores and MS-related WM pathology. Result(s): Relative to HC, MS patients showed reduced FA and ACM in the body of the corpus callosum (CC) containing motor fibres (p< 0.001 and p=0.022 respectively, FWE corrected at the cluster level). We did not find statistically significant correlations between motor fatigue and microstructural disease alterations in rATR (p>0.900) (extracted with the JHU White-Matter Tractography Atlas) or using a whole brain white-matter mask (p>0.706). Conclusion(s): The microstructure in the body of CC, including the transcallosal motor fibres, was significantly altered in the MS group relative to HC. This suggests that individuals with MS have a changed interhemispheric connectivity in the commissural motor fibres. Since we found no association between regional WM microstructure and fatigue, our data do not support the notion that a local structural WM change may be critical for the emergence of fatigue in MS.",Excluded

This study was conducted for the evaluation of the cytogenetic effects of 153Sm-EDTMP in blood lymphocytes from patients with bone metastases (without previous radio or chemotherapy), using the chromosome aberration technique. The degree of cytological damage found in in vivo blood cells of patients was compared with those found in in vitro in an adjusted dose-response curve. Blood samples were collected before and 1 hr after the administration of 153Sm-EDTMP(about 42.31 MBq/kg). The frequency of structural chromosome aberration per cell observed in 1 hr samples (0.054+/-0.035 CA/cell) was higher than basal ones (0.031+/-0.026 CA/cell), although this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.101). For in vitro assay, blood samples were exposed to different concentrations of 153Sm-EDTMP, during 1 hr (0.37-1.11 MBq/ml). An increase in the frequency of chromosome aberration per cell as a function of the radioactive concentration was found. The data were adjusted by linear regression model (Y= 3.52+/-2.24 x 10(-2) + 11.15+/-3.46 x 10(-2) X). The frequency of aberration/cell found in vivo was 0.054 and for the same activity in vitro was 0.098, this difference being statistically significant (p = 0.02). This result may be related to blood clearance, osteoblastic activity and individual variability. For a more accurate analysis, the study of more donors is necessary.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to compare different treatment plans - intensity-modulated and conformal - for head and neck cancer patients. Treatment plans were developed for ten head and neck cancer patients by applying four different techniques: two conventional 3D conformal plans (forward treatment planning, with two opposing fields 90degree-270degree and one asymmetric anterior field, matching in isocenter /Conv/, conformal parotis sparing plans /ConPas/), 3D conformal plans with inverse treatment planning techniques /INVCRT/ and intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans /IMRT/. The plans were made for the same target volumes PTV<inf>50</inf> (elective) and PTV<inf>66</inf> (boost-16 Gy). The cumulative dose was 66 Gy, and the Philips Pinnacle3 v8.0m TPS was used for treatment planning. The organs at risk (OAR) were as follows: spinal cord, brain stem, left and right parotis and oral cavity. The dose constrains and conditions for optimization were determined for IMRT techniques with 7 fields. During the optimization we applied two different protocols: in one case the plans were made by 40 segments for ""step and shoot"" IMRT techniques and by 14 segments for INVCRT, which were converted into static fields. The homogeneity (HI) and conformity (COIN) indices were calculated for planning target volumes and the comparisons were assessed on several dosimetric parameters for OARs. The IMRT, INVCRT, Conv and ConPas techniques for PTV<inf>50</inf> planning target volume gave the following values for homogeneity index: 0.13, 0.18, 0.22, 0.19, and for conformity index: 0.76, 0.68, 0.13, 0.09. The spinal cord received a maximum of 38 Gy, 42 Gy, 45 Gy and 44 Gy for the PTV<inf>66</inf>. Mean doses of the oral cavity outside the target volume were 33 Gy, 36 Gy, 30 Gy and 48 Gy. When the 16 Gy boost treatment was applied on one side only, the mean dose for the parotis on the contralateral side was 28 Gy, 31 Gy, 49 Gy and 43 Gy, while 39 Gy, 41 Gy, 59 Gy and 53 Gy on the same side. The objectives of adequate target coverage and sparing of critical structures were fulfilled only with IMRT technique. Although the sparing of the oral cavity was the most effectively provided by the traditional technique - due to the arrangement of the fields - it gave the worst results regarding the parotis and the target volume. The highest dose for the oral cavity was given by the ConPas technique, which can cause serious early and late side effects. By increasing the number of segments for IMRT at a reasonable level, the dose for OARs can be reduced. Copyright © Professional Publishing Hungary.",Excluded
3325,"""Low-intensity laser therapy effect on the recovery of traumatic spinal cord injury"". Scientific advances have been made to optimize the healing process in spinal cord injury. Studies have been developed to obtain effective treatments in controlling the secondary injury that occurs after spinal cord injury, which substantially changes the prognosis. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been applied in neuroscience due to its anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissue in the repairing process. Few studies have been made associating LILT to the spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the LILT (GaAlAs laser-780 nm) on the locomotor functional recovery, histomorphometric, and histopathological changes of the spinal cord after moderate traumatic injury in rats (spinal cord injury at T9 and T10). Thirty-one adult Wistar rats were used, which were divided into seven groups: control without surgery (n = 3), control surgery (n = 3), laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5), medullar lesion (n = 5) without phototherapy, medullar lesion + laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), and medullar lesion + laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5). The assessment of the motor function was performed using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and adapted Sciatic Functional Index (aSFI). The assessment of urinary dysfunction was clinically performed. After 21 days postoperative, the animals were euthanized for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the spinal cord. The results showed faster motor evolution in rats with spinal contusion treated with LILT, maintenance of the effectiveness of the urinary system, and preservation of nerve tissue in the lesion area, with a notorious inflammation control and increased number of nerve cells and connections. In conclusion, positive effects on spinal cord recovery after moderate traumatic spinal cord injury were shown after LILT.",Excluded

992,"When a headache isn't just a headache: A case of tolosa-hunt syndrome. Background: First described by Tolosa in 1954 as painful opthalmoplegia, consisting of periorbital or hemi-cranial pain combined with ipsilateral third, fourth and/or sixth nerve palsies. Caused by a granulomatous inflammation within the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure or orbit1. Hunt et al. in 1961, noted the therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids in this condition. Inflammation can extend beyond the cavernous sinus affecting the maxillary and mandibular branch of the trigeminal and the facial nerve2. Case: A 34-year-old female, presented with headache and diplopia. The headache was left sided, occipital and intermittent with radiation to the left eye. Eight days prior to presentation the patient developed blurring of the vision in the left eye and pain described as being in the left 'eye socket'. Referred from the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital with left sided ptosis, left 3rd nerve palsy and binocular diplopia. No change in sensation. Imaging was carried out; MRI brain showed a pseudo-obstruction orbital inflammatory tumour. CT angiogram showed changes at the left orbital apex to the superior ophthalmic fissure and into the left cavernous sinus. Once commenced on prednisolone the patient had immediate improvement in symptoms. Discussion(s): This case highlights a typical presentation. Incidence is estimated as one per million3. Awide list of differentials for painful opthalmoplegia should be considered including; trauma, vascular malformation, neoplasm, infection and inflammation. Painful opthalmoplegia can also be affected by giant cell arteritis, opthalmoplegic migraine or diabetic opthalmoplegia2. Recurrence occurs in 30-40%. A self-limiting disease; the symptoms of which are improved dramatically by corticosteroids. Conclusion(s): As there are no known triggers of the inflammation, the syndrome often falls into the category of idiopathic orbital inflammation (pseudo tumour). The syndrome effects all ages and occurs equally in both sexes. It is important that Tolosa-Hunt syndrome remains a differential diagnosis of painful opthalmoplegia.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To compare the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections with respect to successful intra-articular needle placement, fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and dose area product (DAP).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. 498 fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections were performed or supervised by one of nine staff radiologists from 11/1/2010-12/31/2013. The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP).RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001).

Arteriovenous malformations of the brain are congenital vascular lesions that affect 0.01-0.50% of the population, and are generally present in patients aged 20-40 years. The usual clinical presentations are haemorrhage, seizures, progressive neurological deficit, or headache. Results of natural history studies have shown a yearly haemorrhage rate of 1-4%. Frequency of rebleeding has increased over the years, and several factors that increase risk of haemorrhage have been identified. Although substantial, the morbidity associated with haemorrhages could be less than previously thought. Over the past decade, great advances have been made in application of endovascular embolisation techniques, stereotactic radiosurgery, and microsurgery, allowing effective multidisciplinary treatment of arteriovenous malformations, including those previously deemed to be untreatable. Increasing attention has been paid to management of flow-related aneurysms associated with these malformations. Finally, many reports of recurrent arteriovenous malformations have coincided with new theories regarding the embryogenesis of these disorders and laboratory work suggesting their proliferative potential.

965,"Photon capture and signalling by melanopsin retinal ganglion cells. A subset of retinal ganglion cells has recently been discovered to be intrinsically photosensitive, with melanopsin as the pigment. These cells project primarily to brain centres for non-image-forming visual functions such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment. How well they signal intrinsic light absorption to drive behaviour remains unclear. Here we report fundamental parameters governing their intrinsic light responses and associated spike generation. The membrane density of melanopsin is 10(4)-fold lower than that of rod and cone pigments, resulting in a very low photon catch and a phototransducing role only in relatively bright light. Nonetheless, each captured photon elicits a large and extraordinarily prolonged response, with a unique shape among known photoreceptors. Notably, like rods, these cells are capable of signalling single-photon absorption. A flash causing a few hundred isomerized melanopsin molecules in a retina is sufficient for reaching threshold for the pupillary light reflex.",Excluded
3498,"Inhibition of Polo-like kinase 1 prevents the growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain. Few therapeutic strategies exist for the treatment of metastatic tumor cells in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access. Thus the identification of molecular targets and accompanying BBB permeable drugs will significantly benefit brain metastasis patients. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an attractive molecular target because it is only expressed in dividing cells and its expression is upregulated in many tumors. Analysis of a publicly available database of human breast cancer metastases revealed Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in brain metastases compared to systemic metastases (P = 0.0018). The selective Plk1 inhibitor, GSK461364A, showed substantial uptake in normal rodent brain. Using a breast cancer brain metastatic xenograft model (231-BR), we tested the efficacy of GSK461364A to prevent brain metastatic colonization. When treatment was started 3 days post-injection, GSK461364A at 50 mg/kg inhibited the development of large brain metastases 62% (P = 0.0001) and prolonged survival by 17%. GSK461364A sensitized tumor cells to radiation induced cell death in vitro. Previously, it was reported that mutations in p53 might render tumor cells more sensitive to Plk1 inhibition; however, p53 mutations are uncommon in breast cancer. In a cohort of 41 primary breast tumors and matched brain metastases, p53 immunostaining was increased in 61% of metastases; 44% of which were associated with primary tumors with low p53. The data suggest that p53 overexpression occurs frequently in brain metastases and may facilitate sensitivity to Plk1 inhibition. These data indicate Plk1 may be a new druggable target for the prevention of breast cancer brain metastases.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple prognostic models for predicting survival after treatment for brain metastases have been developed. One of them, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA), has been developed to predict the median survival for brain metastases from the most frequent primary sites: lung carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal tumours. In this study we aim to compare the survival predicted by the DS-GPA to actual survival, and to assess this models performance on both population and individual levels.METHODS: We identified a consecutive cohort of patients treated with SRS for brain metastases in our institute. DS-GPA scores were calculated for each patient, and the median survival for each DS-GPA group was calculated. Differences in survival between DS-GPA groups were tested with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and log-rank tests.RESULTS: In total 367 patients were included in the analysis. Median survival in our cohort is largely comparable to corresponding DS-GPA cohorts, but some notable differences are present. There was a significantly shorter median survival (15.4months, compared to 26.5months) in the adenocarcinoma NSCLC subgroup with a GPA score of 2.3-3. We confirmed the significant differences in survival time for most cancer-specific subgroups.CONCLUSION: DS-GPA seems to be a reliable tool to classify patients with brain metastases treated with SRS into prognostic subgroups. However, we found some aberrations from predicted median survival times, which may be due to specific characteristics of the populations of patients treated with SRS versus other patients.",Excluded

Introduction Aim Functional outcomes after elective colectomy (right, left or sigmoid) for neoplasia are poorly reported in the literature. This study evaluates bowel function and related quality of life in patients 2 - 4 years after hemicolectomy, comparing the results to healthy controls. Methods Eligible patients were identified from prospectively maintained colorectal databases at two teaching hospitals. Patients were recruited during regular follow up visits or by telephone interview. Patient relatives with an intact colon were recruited as controls. Study exclusion criteria were poor cognitive ability, inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic disease, previous pelvic radiation, prior colonic, stomach or small bowel resection, bypass surgery, vagotomy, an existing stoma and anal incontinence. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) questionnaire was used to assess bowel function and the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess quality of life (QOL). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used with log transformation and regression methods for skewed data. Association between EQ-5D and MSKCC scores was examined with Spearman's rank correlation. Results A total of 85 patients (mean age 69 +/- 11.2 years) and 85 controls (mean age 58.2 +/- 13.4 years) were recruited in 12 months. Patients reported a significantly higher number of bowel movements per day than controls (2 versus 1, P < 0.001). Initial analysis suggested that patients had a significantly lower total MSKCC score (group difference mean -3.1, CI -5.8 to -0.4, p = 0.02), indicating worse bowel function in the patient group. Following adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, differences in total score were no longer significant, but the patient group had a lower score for the frequency subscale and the ability to control flatus (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). MSKCC frequency scores were worse after right-sided resections (p = 0.03). High scores for complete emptying and the differentiation between wind and solid had a positive correlation with better QOL (p = 0.007 and 0.02 respectively). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the overall QOL (EQ-5D p = 0.6, EQ-VAS p = 0.12) following hemicolectomy compared with controls. Conclusion Colonic resection has an adverse effect on bowel frequency with worse outcomes following right hemicolectomy. Good colonic function, as assessed by the MSKCC questionnaire, is associated with better QOL.",Excluded

Thalamic projections to somatosensory, dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes and optic radiations (case tracts) and the arcuate (non-thalamic control tract) were manually drawn in TrackVis (Fig.1). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), reflecting microstructural damage, were extracted for each tract. Associations between ADC(tCr) and microstructural parameters were tested using linear mixed-effect models. (Figure presented) Results: In MS, lower thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with lower mean FA and higher mean MD of pooled thalamo-cortical tracts after adjusting for disease duration, gender and tract-specific lesion load (p=0.033 and p=0.047). No correlation was found in HCs. Unadjusted tract-by-tract analysis confirmed the correlation between thalamic ADC(tCr) and MD in patients. The arcuate tract, not connected to the thalamus, showed no correlation (Fig.2). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with specific microstructural damage of thalamo-cortical tracts in MS, suggesting that energy dysfunction in this crucial hub - through an impaired Cr/PhCr transport/utilization - may disrupt thalamo-cortical networks by inducing the selective anterograde degeneration of connected fibers.",Excluded
726,"Half body irradiation for palliation of widespread metastatic bone disease. An analysis is made of 134 patients treated by a single dose half body irradiation at the Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Singapore General Hospital. A total of 149 fields were treated with 15 patients receiving both upper and lower half treatments. This technique achieved a more than 70% subjective pain relief in the patients who had widespread bony metastases. Side effects were minimal and this technique has been used on an outpatient basis since the first preliminary study in 1986. There was a dose response, more than 75% (75 out of 97 patients) with pain relief using doses of 700 cGy and above. Sensitive tumours also produced better results with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, prostate and breast having pain relief in more than 70% of patients. The largest group of patients (51 cases) treated was nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as this tumour is fairly common locally and often presents with bony metastases as the first site of spread.",Excluded

PURPOSE: [11C]Cimbi-36 was recently developed as an agonist radioligand for brain imaging of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2A) with positron emission tomography (PET). This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT2A receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [11C]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology.PROCEDURES: [11C]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [11C]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT2A receptor agonist actions of [11C]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR).RESULTS: The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 muSv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR.CONCLUSIONS: Administration of tracer doses of [11C]Cimbi-36 does not seem to be associated with unusual radiation burden or adverse clinical effects.",Excluded
41,"Long-term correlation of the electrocorticogram as a bioindicator of brain exposure to ionizing radiation. Understanding the effects of radiation and its possible influence on the nervous system are of great clinical interest.However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR).A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG).The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity.Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source.The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the alpha-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation.Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR.In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.

Ultrasound tissue characterization based on the coefficient of nonlinearity, beta<sub>n</sub> = 1 + B/2A, has been demonstrated to produce added diagnostic value due to its large variation and sensitivity to tissue structure. However, the parameter has been observed to be significantly correlated to the speed of sound and density. These relationships are analyzed empirically as well as theoretically by developing a pressure-density relation based on a thermodynamic model and the Mie intermolecular potential. The results indicate that for many soft tissues, the coefficient of nonlinearity is largely determined by the isentropic compressibility, kappa<sub>s</sub>. Consequently, for tissue characterization, estimating the nonlinear response of the medium, given by beta<sub>p</sub> = beta<sub>n</sub>kappa<sub>s</sub>, appears to be beneficial due to correlated quantities.",Excluded

Cells deficient in ATM (product of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia patients) or NBS (product of the gene mutated in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome) show increased yields of both simple and complex chromosomal aberrations after high doses (>0.5Gy) of ionizing radiation (X-rays or gamma-rays), however less is known on how these cells respond at low dose. Previously we had shown that the increased chromosome aberrations in ATM and NBS defective lines was due to a significantly larger quadratic dose-response term compared to normal fibroblasts for both simple and complex exchanges. The linear dose-response term for simple exchanges was significantly higher in NBS cells compared to wild type cells, but not for AT cells. However, AT cells have a high background level of exchanges compared to wild type or NBS cells that confounds the understanding of low dose responses. To understand the sensitivity differences for high to low doses, chromosomal aberration analysis was first performed at low dose-rates (0.5Gy/d), and results provided further evidence for the lack of sensitivity for exchanges in AT cells below doses of 1Gy. Normal lung fibroblast cells treated with KU-55933, a specific ATM kinase inhibitor, showed increased numbers of exchanges at a dose of 1Gy and higher, but were similar to wild type cells at 0.5Gy or below. These results were confirmed using siRNA knockdown of ATM. The present study provides evidence that the increased radiation sensitivity of AT cells for chromosomal exchanges found at high dose does not occur at low dose.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Free radicals (FR) are atoms, molecules or their fragments, whose excess leads to the development of the oxidizing stress, which is the cause of many neoplasmic, neurodegenerative, inflammatory diseases and aging the organism. The main exogenous sources of free radicals are among others: industrial pollution, tobacco smoke, ionizing radiation, ultrasound and magnetic field. The low frequency magnetic field is more and more applied in the physician therapy. The aim of our study was to prove, if the magnetically field applied in the magntetotherapy, affects generating the reactive forms of oxygen according to its working time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research material made up male, adult, Sprague-Dawley race rats age 3-4 months. To investigation compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid, the blood was taken from the rat caudal vein into the test-glass including EDTA before being affected by the magnetic field. After the single exposition and after 14 days of being affected by the magnetic field, the concentration of the compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid in the serum was measured.RESULTS: After the single exposition to the changeable magnetic field (frequency 40 Hz, induction 7 mT, working time 30' and 60 min) the process of the peroxidation of lipids slowed down. A increase of the peroxidation of lipids was observed after 14 days and these changes are statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Low magnetic field used in magnetotherapy causes the changes of the generating the reactive forms of oxygen.",Excluded
912,"Recurrent non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a review on the new pathological classification, management guidelines and treatment options. At least 50% of surgically resected non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) recur. Either early or late adjuvant radiotherapy is highly efficacious in controlling recurrent NFPA but associates potentially burdensome complications like hypopituitarism, vascular complications or secondary neoplasm. Reoperation is indicated in bulky tumor rests compressing the optic pathway. To date, no standardized medical therapy is available for recurrent NFPA although cabergoline and temozolomide show promising results. Guidelines on the management of recurrent NFPAs are now available. The new 2017 WHO pituitary tumor classification, based on immunohistochemistry and transcription factor assessment, identifies a group of aggressive NFPA variants that may benefit from earlier adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, NFPA patients exhibit a reduced overall life expectancy largely due to hypopituitarism and treatment-related morbidity. The management of recurrent NFPA benefits from a multidisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, endocrinologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists and neuro-radiologists in order to provide individualized therapy and anticipate deterioration.

482,"Radiosurgery of the rat hippocampus: magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological, histological, and behavioral studies. OBJECTIVE: To explore the histological, electrophysiological, radiological, and behavioral effects of radiosurgery using a new model of proton beam radiosurgery (PBR) of the rodent hippocampus.METHODS: Forty-one rats underwent PBR of the right hippocampus with nominal doses of 5 to 130 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE). Three control animals were untreated. Three months after PBR, 41 animals were evaluated with the Morris water maze, 23 with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 22 with intrahippocampal microelectrode recordings. Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain.

2207,"The effect of rowing ergometry and resistive exercise on skeletal muscle structure and function during bed rest. Exposure to microgravity causes functional and structural impairment of skeletal muscle. Current exercise regimens are time-consuming and insufficiently effective; an integrated countermeasure is needed that addresses musculoskeletal along with cardiovascular health. High-intensity, short-duration rowing ergometry and supplemental resistive strength exercise may achieve these goals. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers completed 5 wk of head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR): 18 were randomized to exercise, 9 remained sedentary. Exercise consisted of rowing ergometry 6 days/wk, including interval training, and supplemental strength training 2 days/wk. Measurements before and after HDBR and following reambulation included assessment of strength, skeletal muscle volume (MRI), and muscle metabolism (magnetic resonance spectroscopy); quadriceps muscle biopsies were obtained to assess muscle fiber types, capillarization, and oxidative capacity. Sedentary bed rest (BR) led to decreased muscle volume (quadriceps: -9 +/- 4%, P < 0.001; plantar flexors: -19 +/- 6%, P < 0.001). Exercise (ExBR) reduced atrophy in the quadriceps (-5 +/- 4%, interaction P = 0.018) and calf muscle, although to a lesser degree (-14 +/- 6%, interaction P = 0.076). Knee extensor and plantar flexor strength was impaired by BR (-14 +/- 15%, P = 0.014 and -22 +/- 7%, P = 0.001) but preserved by ExBR (-4 +/- 13%, P = 0.238 and +13 +/- 28%, P = 0.011). Metabolic capacity, as assessed by maximal O2 consumption, (31)P-MRS, and oxidative chain enzyme activity, was impaired in BR but stable or improved in ExBR. Reambulation reversed the negative impact of BR. High-intensity, short-duration rowing and supplemental strength training effectively preserved skeletal muscle function and structure while partially preventing atrophy in key antigravity muscles. Due to its integrated cardiovascular benefits, rowing ergometry could be a primary component of exercise prescriptions for astronauts or patients suffering from severe deconditioning.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): From July 2012 to October 2013, this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant prospective study included 51 patients with breast cancer (50 women; mean age, 56 years; range, 32-76 years; one man; aged 70 years) who completed PET/MR imaging with diffusion-weighted and contrast material-enhanced sequences after unenhanced PET/CT. Written informed consent for study participation was obtained. Two independent readers for each modality recorded site and number of lesions. Imaging and clinical follow-up, with consensus in two cases, served as the reference standard. Result(s): There were 242 distant metastatic lesions in 30 patients, 18 breast cancers in 17 patients, and 19 positive axillary nodes in eight patients. On a per-patient basis, PET/MR imaging with diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced sequences depicted distant (30 of 30 [100%] for readers 1 and 2) and axillary (eight of eight [100%] for reader 1, seven of eight [88%] for reader 2) metastatic disease at rates similar to those of unenhanced PET/CT (distant metastatic disease: 28 of 29 [96%] for readers 3 and 4, P = .50; axillary metastatic disease: seven of eight [88%] for readers 3 and 4, P. .99) and outperformed PET/CT in the detection of breast cancer (17 of 17 [100%] for readers 1 and 2 vs 11 of 17 [65%] for reader 3 and 10 of 17 [59%] for reader 4; P<.001).

3281,"Real versus simulated mobile phone exposures in experimental studies. We examined whether exposures to mobile phone radiation in biological/clinical experiments should be performed with real-life Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) emitted by commercially available mobile phone handsets, instead of simulated EMFs emitted by generators or test phones. Real mobile phone emissions are constantly and unpredictably varying and thus are very different from simulated emissions which employ fixed parameters and no variability. This variability is an important parameter that makes real emissions more bioactive. Living organisms seem to have decreased defense against environmental stressors of high variability. While experimental studies employing simulated EMF-emissions present a strong inconsistency among their results with less than 50% of them reporting effects, studies employing real mobile phone exposures demonstrate an almost 100% consistency in showing adverse effects. This consistency is in agreement with studies showing association with brain tumors, symptoms of unwellness, and declines in animal populations. Average dosimetry in studies with real emissions can be reliable with increased number of field measurements, and variation in experimental outcomes due to exposure variability becomes less significant with increased number of experimental replications. We conclude that, in order for experimental findings to reflect reality, it is crucially important that exposures be performed by commercially available mobile phone handsets.

378,"ATM kinase inhibition preferentially sensitizes p53-mutant glioma to ionizing radiation. PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain cancer with a median survival of only 12 to 15 months. Current standard treatment consists of surgery followed by chemoradiation. The poor survival of patients with GBM is due to aggressive tumor invasiveness, an inability to remove all tumor tissue, and an innate tumor chemo- and radioresistance. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an excellent target for radiosensitizing GBM because of its critical role in regulating the DNA damage response and p53, among other cellular processes. As a first step toward this goal, we recently showed that the novel ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 reduced migration, invasion, and growth, and potently radiosensitized human glioma cells in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using orthotopic xenograft models of GBM, we now show that KU-60019 is also an effective radiosensitizer in vivo. Human glioma cells expressing reporter genes for monitoring tumor growth and dispersal were grown intracranially, and KU-60019 was administered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery or osmotic pump.RESULTS: Our results show that the combined effect of KU-60019 and radiation significantly increased survival of mice 2- to 3-fold over controls. Importantly, we show that glioma with mutant p53 is much more sensitive to KU-60019 radiosensitization than genetically matched wild-type glioma.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that an ATM kinase inhibitor may be an effective radiosensitizer and adjuvant therapy for patients with mutant p53 brain cancers.",Excluded

261,"Distinct response of adult neural stem cells to low versus high dose ionising radiation. Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50-500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation.",Included

However, their target molecules and the signaling mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we showed for the first time that OA and DA modulate the Na+-activated K+ (KNa) channels in an opposite way in Kenyon cells isolated from the mushroom body of the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. Patch-clamp recordings showed that the single-channel conductance of the KNa channel was about 122 pS with high K+ in the patch pipettes. The channel was found to be activated by intracellular Na+ but less activated by Li+. K+ channel blockers TEA and quinidine reduced the open probability (Po) of this channel. Bath application of OA and DA respectively increased and decreased the Po of KNa channel currents. An increase and a decrease in Po of KNa channels were also observed by applying the membrane-permeable analogs 8-Br-cyclic-AMP and 8-Br-cGMP, respectively. Furthermore, it was revealed that cAMP-induced increase and cGMP-induced decrease in Po were attenuated by the specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 and protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT5823, respectively.

The stimulation parameters were adjusted according to the results of accurate computer-assisted and magnetic resonance imaging-based reconstructions of the current density distributions induced by rTMS in the rat and human brain, ensuring comparable stimulation patterns in both cases. Adult male rats were treated in two 3-day series under halothane anesthesia. In the forced swim test, rTMS-treatment induced a more active coping strategy in the high anxiety-related behavior rats only (time spent struggling; 332% vs. controls), allowing these animals to reach the performance of low anxiety-related behavior rats. In contrast, rTMS-treated low anxiety-related behavior rats did not change their swimming behavior. The development of active coping strategies in high anxiety-related behavior rats was accompanied by a significantly attenuated stress-induced elevation of plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations. In summary, the behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of rTMS of frontal brain regions in high anxiety-related behavior rats are comparable to the effects of antidepressant drug treatment.

2691,"Quantifying visual pathway axonal and myelin loss in neuromyelitis optic. OBJECTIVE: To determine how optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures reflecting the health of neurons (total macular volume, TMV) and axons (retinal nerve fibre layer, RNFL) relate to MRI-derived measures of myelin (myelin water fraction, MWF) in the optic radiation (OR) of individuals with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) compared to healthy controls. BACKGROUND: NMO is an autoimmune disorder characterized by episodes of inflammation and damage to astrocytes that can result in optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis. The optic nerve is a frequent site for demyelination resulting in visual dysfunction which may be reflected by OCT measures of axonal health and MWF of the OR. DESIGN/METHODS: 8 eyes with ON (NMO<sup>1</sup>) and 12 eyes without ON (NMO<sup>2</sup>) from ten NMO patients (EDSS 2.06.0, mean age=43y, 3M/7F) and 24 eyes of twelve healthy subjects (mean age=31y, 3M/9F) were included. OCT assessment involved a Macular Volume protocol (volume of retina in the center 6mm of the macula) and a RNFL Thickness scan (3.4mm ring scan of retinal thickness around optic nerve). The MRI protocol included a 32-echo T2-relaxation GRASE sequence. Average MWF values were calculated within the OR. RESULT(S): RNFL thickness (NMO<sup>1</sup>:70.5+/-17.9mum; NMO<sup>2</sup>:91.3+/-8.7mum; controls:102.9+/-15.0mum) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.01) and controls (p<0.0001). TMV (NMO<sup>1</sup>:7.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; NMO<sup>2</sup>:8.4+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; controls:8.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.02) and controls (p<0.0001). Also NMO<sup>2</sup> had reduced TMV compared to controls (p=0.02). Decreased OR MWF was also observed in NMO (NMO:0.098+/-0.01; controls:0.11+/-0.01, p=0.02). There was a strong correlation between the OR MWF and RNFL (r=0.50,p=0.003) and TMV (r=0.60,p=0.0002).

2058,"The Treatment of Melanoma Brain Metastases. Melanoma is the malignancy with the highest rate of dissemination to the central nervous system once it metastasizes. Until recently, the prognosis of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) was poor. In recent years, however, the prognosis has improved due to high-resolution imaging that facilitates early detection of small asymptomatic brain metastases and early intervention with local modalities such as stereotactic radiosurgery. More recently, a number of systemic therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for metastatic melanoma, resulting in improved survival for many MBM patients. Registration trials for these newer therapies excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, and a number of studies specifically tailored to this population of patients have been conducted or are underway. Herein, we review contemporary locoregional and systemic therapies and describe the unique challenges posed by treatment of brain metastases, such as radionecrosis, cerebral edema, and pseudoprogression. Since the number of systemic and combined modality clinical trials has increased, we expect that the treatment landscape for patients with melanoma brain metastasis will change dramatically. In addition to ongoing clinical trials, which show great promise, we conclude that our understanding of intracranial metastasis remains quite limited. In addition to inter-disciplinary, multi-modality studies, bench-side work to better understand the process of cerebrotropism is needed to fuel more drug development and further improve outcomes.

The pharmaceutical inhibition of mTOR was identified as a potential strategy for the augmentation of radiation-induced cell damages in different cancers although the detailed molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. Furthermore as mTOR inhibitors particularly show suppression of double-strand break repair a role for a combined therapy by mTOR-inhibitors and carbon ion irradiation is to hypothesize. Our aim was to analyse the effect of the mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions in primary human meningioma cells. Methods. Tumour specimens from 6 patients suffering from meningiomas, 4 with WHO Grad I and 2 with WHO Grade II, were obtained after surgical resection from the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Saarland, Homburg/Saar, Germany, plated on tissue culture plates and cultured under standard conditions as previously described. Primary cells up to passage 7 were treated with irradiation by carbon ions (0.125 to 2 Gy) or photons (0.5 to 8 Gy) alone and in combination with Temsirolimus (0.5 to 2 muM). Furthermore meningioma cells were treated with Temsirolimus alone (0.5 to 5 muM). Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells 6 days after treatment. Results. A dose-dependent reduction of meningioma cells was observed after irradiation by photons as well as by carbon ions. The biological impact on cell reduction after irradiation by carbon ions seems to be four times stronger in comparison to irradiation by photons. The treatment with Temsirolimus alone in a concentration up to 5 muM causes a cell reduction of 69% in benign WHO Grade I meningioma cells whereas WHO Grade II meningioma cells were only reduced by 31%. The combination of irradiation and Temsirolimus in concentrations up to 2 muM effects a further cell reduction for both carbon ions (0.5 Gy) and photons (2 Gy) up to 30% in comparisons to irradiation alone. Conclusion. Our study shows promising preliminary results regarding the antiproliferative effect on meningioma cells by mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and as a radiosensitizer in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions. Further experiments have to be performed to confirm these results.",Excluded
2041,"Radiation as a local ablative therapy option for oligoprogressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with osimertinib. Purpose/Objective(s): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved response rate and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their efficacy is limited by acquired resistance and disease progression. Local ablative therapy (LAT) has shown a survival benefit in patients with oligometastatic disease in retrospective studies. At our institution, we are conducting a prospective single-arm Phase 2 study of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI. Following LAT to the sites of progression with either radiation or surgery, patients are re-initiated on osimertinib. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and efficacy of re-initiation of osimertinib, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that osimertinib and radiation can be safely administered sequentially, and that LAT followed by re-initiation of osimertinib will result in improved PFS. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with no prior EGFR-TKI exposure (cohort 1) or progression after 1st/2nd generation EGFR-TKIs with acquired T790M mutation (cohort 2) receive osimertinib. Upon progression, eligible patients with <=5 progressing sites undergo LAT by either radiation therapy or surgery, then resume osimertinib until further disease progression. Patients previously treated with osimertinib with disease progression who qualify for LAT are also eligible (cohort 3). Prior to beginning radiation, patients must be off osimertinib for at least 2 wks, and total time off osimertinib must be less than 8 wks. Result(s): Fifteen patients with a median age of 57 (range 36-71) were enrolled between 4/2016 and 1/2017 (cohorts 1/2/3: 9/3/3 patients). Overall, treatment has been well tolerated, with rash, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and alanine transaminase elevation the most common adverse events (AEs). Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 4 (27%) patients. Objective response rates among evaluable patients prior to LAT in cohorts 1 and 2 were 71% (5/7) and 100% (2/2), respectively. Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI: 3.4 mo-undefined) in cohort 1; there have been no progressions in cohort 2. To date, 2/5 patients receiving LAT have received radiation (both in cohort 3). One patient received 5 Gy x 5 to 2 lung lesions, while the other received 24 Gy and 18 Gy by stereotactic radiosurgery to 2 brain metastases. Additional endpoints include assessment of mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib by multi-omics analyses of tumor, blood, and saliva; results from these analyses will also be presented. Conclusion(s): Oligoprogressive disease can be safely treated with LAT, including radiation therapy, in patients with limited metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR-TKI therapy. This approach could potentially prevent premature switching to other, less-effective systemic therapies by maximizing the duration and efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment in selected patients.",Excluded
3805,"Electric field stimulation of precision-cut lung slices. The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) technique is widely used to examine airway responses in different species. We developed a method to study nerve-dependent bronchoconstriction by the application of electric field stimulation (EFS) to PCLS. PCLS prepared from Wistar rats were placed between two platinum electrodes to apply serial rectangular impulses (5-100 Hz), and bronchoconstriction was studied by videomicroscopy. The extent of airway contractions increased with higher frequencies. Stable repeated airway contractions were obtained at a frequency of 50 Hz, a width of 1 ms, and an output of 200 mA for 2.5 s each minute. Larger airways showed stronger responses. The EFS-triggered contractions were increased by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine (10 muM) and reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 muM), whereas the thromboxane protanoid receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 muM) had no effect. Magnesium ions (10 mM) antagonized airway contractions induced by EFS, but not by methacholine, indicating that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS. Our data further show that the electrically evoked airway contractions in PCLS are mediated by cholinergic nerves, independent of thromboxane and more prominent in larger airways. Taken together these findings show that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS, and they suggest that the present method is useful to study neurogenic responses in airways of different size.

1148,"Putting the ""eye"" in syphilis. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize the ocular presentations of syphilis LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Understand the relationship between ocular syphilis and neurosyphilis. Interpret the different laboratory studies for diagnosing syphilis. CASE: A 28-year old woman presented with one week of a deep aching pain in her right eye with radiation to the back of her head. The pain was exacerbated with eye movements. She also described blurred vision in the right eye over the same time period. She had a history of migraine headaches, traumatic C4 fracture three years ago and hypertension. Physical examination demonstrated visual acuity of 20/100 in the right and 20/ 20 in the left eye. Extra-ocular movements were intact but painful. Slit lamp examination revealed mild periorbital edema and 2+ conjunctiva and scleral injection on the right. Dilated fundus exam noted mild blurring of the disk margin nasally. Initial laboratory studies noted normal electrolytes, a negative rapidHIV, and a normal uric acid level. B scan ultrasonographywas notable for posterior scleral thickening, lateral greater than medial, which was confirmed by CT scan of the orbits. She was sent home with a one-week course of prednisone and ibuprofen with a presumptive diagnosis of scleritis. Further serologieswere pending. Initially, she had relief frompain and improved vision while treated with prednisone and ibuprofen. However, two weeks later these symptoms had returned. Her RPR was 1:16; treponomal pallidum partial agglutination was reactive. Her ANA was 1:80 with a speckled pattern. She was admitted for lumbar puncture and treatment of neurosyphilis with Penicillin G Benzathine. CSF revealed VDRL was non-reactive and a lymphocytic pleocytosis was noted on the cell count. DISCUSSION: Despite a minor decrease in syphilis rates in the United States, syphilis continues to be a disease encountered by the general internist. Recognizing the uncommon manifestations of syphilis not only improves the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis, but also other sexually transmitted infections. Syphilitic-related eye disease can occur at any stage and presents in a variety of ways. Ocular manifestations include chancres of the eyelid and conjunctiva, blepharitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, Argyll Robinson pupil, madarosis, neuroretinitis, and uveitis. Though data is limited, uveitis may be the most common ocular presentation in patients infected with HIV. In patients with HIV, the presentation is often bilateral, more severe, and frequently involves the posterior segment of the eye. There does not appear to be a correlation between CD4 count and the presence of ocular involvement. Ocular syphilis is treated as neurosyphilis and therefore must be treated with intravenous penicillin G. A diagnosis of ocular syphilis is made with non-treponemal tests such as an RPR or VRDL, measuring IgM and IgG to anticardiolipin cholesterol lecithin antigens. This is confirmed with a direct treponemal test such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody test (FTABS) or the microhemagglutination assay that measures antibodies to treponemal cellular components. A positive CSF VDRL or a lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF fluid is also confirmatory. The need for CSF analysis is debated as treatment does not change, but should probably be done, especially in patients with HIV.",Excluded
829,"Administration of 8-OH-DPAT into the midbrain raphe nuclei: Effects on medial hypothalamic NE-induced feeding. The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) has been shown to elicit dose-dependent feeding in satiated rats when injected into the midbrain raphe nuclei. Because the feeding-stimulatory effects of this compound are associated with reduced 5-HT release in forebrain, and because recent evidence suggests that medial hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) and 5-HT may function antagonistically in the control of feeding, the present study sought to determine whether 8-OH-DPAT would enhance feeding induced by infusing NE into the medial hypothalamus. All experiments were conducted using ad libitum-fed adult male rats with two indwelling cannulas, one aimed at the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the other at either the dorsal or median raphe. In the first series of experiments rats received a fixed dose of 8- OH-DPAT (0.8 nmol) microinjected into the dorsal or median raphe, as well as NE (0, 10, 20 nmol) administered into the PVN. In the second series, rats received varying doses of raphe 8-OH-DPAT (0, 0.4, 0.8 nmol) coinjected with a single dose of PVN NE (20 nmol). Results indicated that 8-OH-DPAT and NE both elicited reliable increases in 1-h food intake, although their effects did not interact. In the final series, rats were injected with subthreshold doses of both compounds. While combined injections of 8-OH-DPAT and NE modestly increased feeding compared with saline control, this increase was not significantly greater than intake found after injection of 8-OH-DPAT or NE alone. These findings, together with other recent work, fail to support the hypothesis that deficits in brain 5-HT elicited by central administration of 8-OH-DPAT can act to enhance feeding stimulated by medial hypothalamic NE.",Excluded
426,"An atypical presentation of a salivary gland tumour: A case report. Adenoid Cystic Salivary Gland malignancies are uncommon, accounting for approximately 8.4 % of salivary gland tumours. The majority are benign, normally presenting as a slowly growing mass, with the parotid gland being the most commonly affected. We present a case report of a 74-year-oldwoman originally referred to neurology with a 5 month history of pain on the right side of her chin, associated with a sensation of sunburn and a 'feeling of a clumsy tongue'. She had no history of radiation exposure and did not smoke. On examination she was found to have numbness on the right side of her chin, with associated right sided tongue deviation and right-sided tongue wasting and numbness. She was initially investigated for an underlying neurological cause. Her MRI demonstrated an abnormality affecting the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. A subsequent CT Neck and Ultrasound demonstrated a lesion within the right sublingual space, which was biopsied and shown to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma. A radical resection of the lesion was performed, resecting from the floor of mouth and base of tongue, with a right-sided selective neck dissection, approached via mandibulotomy. The procedure also involved the formation of a tracheostomy and reconstruction with a free radial forearm flap to the floor of her mouth. The patient also received adjuvant radiotherapy, an additional intervention shown to increase the 5-year survival in advanced disease.

0,"ASCO 2014: High prevalence of FLT-3 ITD mutations in patients (pts) with AML who present with CNS relapse. Background: Despite CR rates of 70% with modern chemotherapeutic regimens, most pts with AML relapse. CNS relapses have become uncommon with the use of high-dose cytarabine based regimens. The features associated with a higher risk of CNS relapse are not defined. Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8. Therapy was successful in clearing all signs of CNS disease in 29 (41%). 19 of the 29 pts (65%) subsequently had additional CNS relapses after a median of 3 months. The 2-year survival rate after CNS relapse was 13%. There was no difference in overall survival among patients with or without CNS disease. Conclusion(s): CNS relapse is a rare occurrence in AML (5%) and is associated with a poor prognosis. A high prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutations was observed in these pts. FLT3 mutational status and LDH level may identify patients with AML who may benefit from CNS prophylaxis.",Excluded

In modern phase III trials of NACR in LARC, pCR ranges 1520%. CET improves response rates in KRAS wild-type (KRAS-WT) metastatic colorectal cancer. S0713 was designed to select patients (PTS) by KRAS-WT status to assess improvement in pCR with CET added to ICT and NACR for LARC. Method(s): Eligibility: Stage IIIII biopsy proven LARC, KRAS-WT, without bowel obstruction or prior therapy, adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function, and performance status of 0-2. Peripheral neuropathy > grade 2 was exclusionary. Enrollment target was 80 eligible PTS with planned interim analysis after 40 PTS received all therapy; if < 7 pCR were observed at interim, the study was to close.

Surgery occurred 3-8 weeks after NACR. 80 eligible PTS would give a power of 90% if true pCR > 35% at a significance of 0.04. The regimen would lack future interest if pCR < 20%. Result(s): From February 2009 to April 2013, 83 PTS registered; 5 were ineligible; 4 not treated. 74 were available for toxicity evaluation (TOX); 72 had available data; 62 PTS (86%) had surgery. 1 grade 5 TOX and 2 grade 4 TOX occurred. 7 PTS withdrew for TOX, 2 for other reasons. 18 of 62 PTS had pCR (25%, 95% CI 16-37%). 19 PTS (26%) had microscopic cancer; 35 PTS (49%) had minor/no response (10 no surgery). Conclusion(s): ICT and NACR with CET improved pCR over historical and recent rates of ~20%. Toxicity was generally acceptable.

2460,"Spatial distribution of brain microhemorrhage resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Introduction Microhemorrhages, commonly found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of TBI, appear as punctuate hypointense foci on susceptibility weighted images (SWI). To better understand the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages, we map their locations to a normalized space and apply region of interest (ROI) analysis using brain atlases. Methods MRI was performed in a series of 46 sequential patients enrolled in a natural history study of TBI. Susceptibility weighted (TR = 64ms, TE = 25ms, FA = 20degree, 0.49 x 0.49 x 2.0 mm) and 3D T1-MPRAGE (TR = 25ms, TE = 3.03ms, FA = 7degree, 1 x 1 x 1 mm) images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Biograph mMR in all patients. SWI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist on a Carestream PACS workstation, and microhemorrhages were labeled using the ""marker"" graphic tool. To characterize their spatial distribution in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, the T1-MPRAGE was affine registered to the MNI template. This transformation was applied to the co-registered SWI images and to the marker coordinates. The frequency of microhemorrhages in major brain structures was determined from ROIs using the digital Talairach brain atlas. Similarly, the frequency of microhemorrhage in labeled white matter (WM) tracts was performed by applying the Diffusion Oriented Tract Segmentation method to the image within MNI space. Results A total of 629 microhemorrhages were identified. An average of 13 +/- 34 (range = 1 +/- 179) microhemorrhages were present in the 24 positive patients out of all 46 cases. Microhemorrhages congregated around the periphery of the brain and were symmetrically distributed. Using Talairach ROI analysis, microhemorrhages were most prevalent in the frontal lobes 60% (377). The remaining lobar distribution was temporal: 10% (63), parietal 1.3% (8), occipital: 4.7% (30), limbic: 3.6% (23). Sublobar distribution was brainstem: 1.4% (9), cerebellum: 4.8% (31), deep cerebral WM: 6.8% (43), thalamus and basal ganglia: 1.3% (8). Microhemorrhages in WM tracts contributed 61% (384) in total. Restricting the analysis to WM tracts, microhemorrhages were primarily found in the corpus callosum 40.3% (253). Other WM tracts with notable proportions ( > 4%) include the anterior thalamic radiation: 4.3% (27), cortico-pontine tract: 4.4% (28), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus: 13.4% (84), inferior longitudinal fasciculus: 5.5% (35), middle cerebellar peduncle 9.1% (57), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus 8% (50), and uncinate fasciculus 4.4% (28). We note, however, that because white matter tracts are relatively small structures and the alignment was performed using only an affine transformation, these results should be considered as preliminary. Conclusions This study examines the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages in 24 TBI patients. Microhemorrhages were distributed mostly around the periphery of the brain, and were particularly common in the frontal lobes. Such a finding is likely due to many of these injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents, possibly with head-on collisions. In the WM tract analysis, the corpus callosum was implicated as a WM pathway that may be vulnerable to damage. Future work will expand the analysis to additional subjects, as well as examine distribution differences between impact and blast injuries. The relationship between microhemorrhage location and neurobehavioral symptoms requires further study.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: During medical imaging, cystic radiation encephalopathy and brain metastasis are difficult to differentiate, and hence they are easily misdiagnosed. To our knowledge, a nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence after more than seven years with cerebral metastasis that mimicked cystic radiation encephalopathy has not been reported.CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital owing to weakness of the right limb for one month, which increased in intensity for three days. He had been diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in 2011, which was treated by radiotherapy. The patient successively developed cystic radiation encephalopathy and brain metastasis from the nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which mimicked cystic radiation encephalopathy relapse. Left frontotemporal craniotomy, surgical resection of brain metastasis, and repair of the skull base and dura were performed. Postoperative computed tomography showed that midline deviation recovered, and brain edema was reduced.CONCLUSIONS: This report is significant because brain metastasis from nasopharyngeal carcinoma can masquerade as a benign entity and cause fatal consequences. In patients presenting with cystic radiation encephalopathy, brain metastasis should be considered as a differential diagnosis.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The effect of different doses of X(-)rays on apoptosis, proliferation, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) expression was investigated in a human glioblastoma cell line.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cell line LN18 was irradiated at room temperature with doses ranging from 0.5 to 15 Gy using 6 MV X(-)rays. Apoptosis was assessed using the annexin V binding assay, proliferation by the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and MMP-2 secretion with zymography. The levels of phosphorylated (pEGFR) were estimated using a commercially available ELISA kit.RESULTS: Cell proliferation decreased in a dose-dependent manner, while apoptosis was increased after radiation. Doses below 2 Gy did not affect proliferation or apoptosis. MMP-2 levels were increased 48 h after radiation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, EGFR signaling was significantly activated 15 min after radiation in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Ionizing radiation activates EGFR signalling and enhances MMP-2 secretion, suggesting that the molecular pathways involved may contribute to the invasiveness and malignant behaviour of glioma cells and help to explain the response of gliomas to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Also antiproliferative effects have been reported against glioblastoma cell lines. DESIGN/METHODS: LAZ PEGylated liposomes (Lipo G) were developed at the University of Houston.. Glioblastoma cell line U87-expressing firefly luciferase reporter gene (100,000 cells in 2 mL) was injected intracranially in each SCID mouse. There were 4 treatment groups (n = 8-9, each): brain model (M) without treatment (control), radiation 2Gy weekly (M + R), LipoGat 5 mug/kg dose intraperitoneally twice per week (M + L) and radiation with LipoG(M + R + L). Treatment lasted three weeks. Tumor size was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), in each mouse. Mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks. Brain was harvested. Lipid peroxidation of brain tissues was quantified by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) as a surrogate biomarker. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis at P= 0.05. RESULT(S): BLI intensity was 4002.03+/-1737.67, 2034+/-737.72, 1387.36+/-684.53 and 2498.89+/-2521.32 % for M, M + R, M+ L and M + R + L, respectively. Tumor size of the M+ L group was reduced by 65% compared to control. There was no significant difference in tumor size of radiated groups compared to control group.MDAbrain concentration inM+ L andM+ R + L groups was significantly less than in M+ R group (8.27+/-0.78 and 10.37+/- 3.30 muM/gm vs. 23.09+/- 3.79 muM/gm).

The dark-adapted current-voltage (I-V) curve of a ventral photoreceptor cell of Limulus, measured by a voltage-clamp technique, has a high slope-resistance region more negative than resting voltage, a lower slope-resistance region between resting voltage and zero, and a negative slope-resistance region more positive than 0 v. With illumination, we find no unique voltage at which there is no light-induced current. At the termination of illumination, the I-V curve changes quickly, then recovers very slowly to a dark-adapted configuration. The voltage-clamp currents during and after illumination can be interpreted to arise from two separate processes. One process (fast) changes quickly with change in illumination, has a reversal potential at +20 mv, and has an I-V curve with positive slope resistance at all voltages. These properties are consistent with a light-induced change in membrane conductance to sodium ions. The other process (slow) changes slowly with changes in illumination, generates light-activated current at +20 mv, and has an I-V curve with a large region of negative slope resistance.

In this study, we assessed the role of the C-terminal domain of thermo-TRPs and its involvement in thermal activation by using chimeras between the heat receptor TRPV1 and the cold receptor TRPM8, in which the entire C-terminal domain was switched. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain is modular and confers the channel phenotype regarding temperature sensitivity, channel gating kinetics, and PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphophate) modulation. Thus, thermo-TRP channels contain an interchangeable specific region, different from the voltage sensor, which allows them to sense temperature stimuli.",Excluded
3854,"Functional significance of XPD polymorphic variants: attenuated apoptosis in human lymphoblastoid cells with the XPD 312 Asp/Asp genotype. Recent molecular epidemiological studies have identified polymorphisms in the XPD gene that are associated with increased risk of brain gliomas and head, neck, lung, and skin cancers. However, the functional significance of these polymorphic variants in altering cell processes such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis is uncertain. We have cloned the XPD variants Lys751Gln, Asp312Asn, and Lys751Gln-Asp312Asn into a pcDNA-3.1-expression vector. Using these constructs, we did not find any detectable difference in either in vitro binding with wild-type p53 or in DNA repair proficiency as measured by host cell reactivation assay. We then genotyped 34 different lymphoblastoid cell lines from six Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH)/Utah pedigree families and a CEPH/French pedigree family for polymorphisms at codons 751 and 312 and assessed their apoptotic response after either UV or ionized radiation exposure. The lymphoblastoid cell lines with homozygous or heterozygous Asp at codon 312 have similar apoptotic rates, whereas cell lines with homozygous Asn at codon 312 showed a 2.5-fold increased response to UV (P = 0.005; Student's t test). This is the first report known to us of a functional polymorphism in a gene involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, the presence of Lys or Gln at codon 751 did not influence the apoptotic response to UV. The diminished apoptotic response of cells containing the 312 Asp allele could both allow the survival and selective clonal expansion of carcinogen-damaged cells and be a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of cancer at diverse tissue sites.",Excluded
3849,"Changes in olfactory inputs modify the energy balance response to short days in male gray mouse lemurs. The role of olfaction/olfactory cues on photoperiodic responses was assessed in Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur. When exposed to short photoperiod (SP), this primate demonstrates rapid changes in energy balance as adaptive anticipatory response for winter survival. To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls. These results suggest that olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy balance.",Excluded

3265,"Time resolved dosimetry of human brain exposed to low frequency pulsed magnetic fields. An accurate dosimetry is a key issue to understanding brain stimulation and related interaction mechanisms with neuronal tissues at the basis of the increasing amount of literature revealing the effects on human brain induced by low-level, low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs). Most literature on brain dosimetry estimates the maximum E field value reached inside the tissue without considering its time pattern or tissue dispersivity. Nevertheless a time-resolved dosimetry, accounting for dispersive tissues behavior, becomes necessary considering that the threshold for an effect onset may vary depending on the pulse waveform and that tissues may filter the applied stimulatory fields altering the predicted stimulatory waveform's size and shape. In this paper a time-resolved dosimetry has been applied on a realistic brain model exposed to the signal presented in Capone et al (2009 J. Neural Transm. 116 257-65), accounting for the broadband dispersivity of brain tissues up to several kHz, to accurately reconstruct electric field and current density waveforms inside different brain tissues. The results obtained by exposing the Duke's brain model to this PMF signal show that the E peak in the brain is considerably underestimated if a simple monochromatic dosimetry is carried out at the pulse repetition frequency of 75 Hz.",Excluded
2739,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and alzheimer's disease. Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy age-matched controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Rates of decline were -0.028 FA units per year in FTLD in the genu of the CC, and -0.017 FA units per year in AD in splenium of the CC. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded
1329,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases. BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients.METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation.RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.",Excluded
653,"Vestibular apparatus disorders in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following reirradiation. [Chinese]. Objective: We studied the effect of reirradiation to the vestibular apparatus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 52 reirradiated NPC patients underwent regular follow-up at Tzu Chi Hospital. Nine were diagnosed with vestibular apparatus disorders, based on detailed histories and balance function tests which included an illegible E-test, and refixation saccade test as well as bithermal air caloric and rotary chair tests. The clinical characteristics were analyzed. Result(s): Of 9 patients with vestibular apparatus disorders, seven had bilateral loss of vestibular function, one had vestibular neuronitis and one had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The 7 patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function had bilateral otitis media and moderate to profound bilateral hearing loss. Illegible E-test, refixation saccade test, electronystagmography, bithermal air caloric test and rotary chair test are useful tools for diagnosis. All 9 patients received total radiation dosages over 12,000 cGy. Conclusion(s): Bilateral loss of vestibular function is the most common vestibular apparatus disorder in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following reirradiation.

385,"A novel small molecule inhibitor of MRCK prevents radiation driven invasion in glioblastoma. Purpose or Objective Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and incurable primary brain tumour that causes severe neurological, cognitive and psychological symptoms. Symptoms are caused and/or exacerbated by the infiltrative properties of GBM cells, which enable them to pervade the healthy brain, disrupting normal function. Recent research has indicated that, while radiotherapy extends life expectancy of patients, it can provoke a more infiltrative phenotype in those GBM cells that survive treatment. In this study we investigate the role of the actin-myosin regulatory kinase, MRCK, in radiation driven infiltration by GBM cells and probe its potential as an anti-invasive target using a novel MRCK specific inhibitor. Material and Methods In vitro motility assays with single cell tracking were used to measure the migration speed of GBM cells on a petri dish. The results were confirmed using an ex vivo assay that uses confocal time-lapse microscopy and single cell tracking to measure the speed of GBM cells migrating through fresh murine brain slices Biomarker response was measure via immuno-blotting, immuno-fluorescence and immuno-histochemistry. In vivo experiments utilised a intracranial xenograft model using a primary GBM cell line. Mice were irradiated using a Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP, Xstrahl). Results GBM cells classically adopt a mesenchymal mode of cell invasion, characterised by an elongated cell body and actin-rich protrusions. Mesenchymal migration requires the activation of the actin-myosin regulatory kinase, MRCK, and consequent phosphorylation of the downstream effectors MLC2 and MYPT1. By measuring relative phosphorylation levels of the MRCK biomarkers, pMLC2 and pMYPT1, we demonstrate that MRCK activity is enhanced at the invasive edges of GBM tumours and is further enhanced by irradiation both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that this response is essential to the phenomenon of radiation induced migration of GBM cells in vitro through MRCK targeted RNAi. Crucially, we were also able to fully abrogate radiation driven invasion in vivo by using a novel small molecule inhibitor, BDP-9066, to specifically target MRCK in a clinically relevant intracranial mouse model of GBM. These data confirm the pivotal role of MRCK in radiation driven infiltration. We are currently undertaking an experiment to investigate whether the anti-invasive effects of BDP-9066 translate into increased survival in our intracranial GBM model, and therefore further validate MRCK as a potential antiinvasive therapeutic target in GBM. Conclusion In conclusion, we have identified a novel and highly promising anti-invasive therapeutic target in GBM, MRCK, which in combination with existing standard of care for glioblastoma, has the potential to improve outcomes for this cancer of unmet need.",Excluded

This paper evaluates the hearing status in the long-term, of patients who have had radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and also discusses the hearing losses from a disability point of view, which takes into account binaural hearing. Forty patients who have had NPC successfully treated by a single radical course of radiotherapy of 70-80 Gy were studied at 2-12 years (mean 6.2 years) after radiotherapy. Each patient was examined clinically and with a pure-tone audiogram. Averaged hearing thresholds over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz were evaluated and a value > 30 dB was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with age-matched controls. The median hearing threshold for each ear in NPC patients was found to be 31.9 dB (range 10.0-86.3 dB) and that for controls 17.5 dB (7.5-38.8 dB) (P < 0.0005, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test). In NPC patients, 44 ears (55.0%) had abnormal hearing, of which 17 (21.3%), 5 (6.3%) and 22 (27.5%) ears had predominantly sensori-neural, conductive and mixed hearing losses, respectively. Nineteen ears had middle ear effusions, accounting for the majority of mixed and conductive hearing losses. In terms of individual patients, 8 (20.0%) and 18 (45.0%) patients had abnormal hearing in one year (monaural hearing disability) and both ears (binaural hearing disability), respectively. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients who have had radiotherapy for NPC, have hearing disability in the long-term, as compared to normal controls.",Included

718,"Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Pain flare occurs after palliative radiotherapy, and dexamethasone has shown potential for prevention of such flare. We aimed to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of placebo in terms of reduction of incidence of pain flare.METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients from 23 Canadian centres were randomly allocated (1:1) with a web-based system and minimisation algorithm to receive either two 4 mg dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets taken orally at least 1 h before the start of radiation treatment (a single 8 Gy dose to bone metastases; day 0) and then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy (days 1-4). Patients were eligible if they had a non-haematological malignancy and bone metastasis (or metastases) corresponding to the clinically painful area or areas. Patients reported their worst pain scores and opioid analgesic intake before treatment and daily for 10 days after radiation treatment. They completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life QLQ-C15-PAL, the bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22), and the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire at baseline, and at days 10 and 42 after radiation treatment. Pain flare was defined as at least a two-point increase on a scale of 0-10 in the worst pain score with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% or greater increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in the worst pain score from days 0-10, followed by a return to baseline levels or below. Primary analysis of incidence of pain flare was by intention-to-treat (patients with missing primary data were classified as having pain flare). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248585, and is completed.FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2011, and Dec 11, 2014, 298 patients were enrolled. 39 (26%) of 148 patients randomly allocated to the dexamethasone group and 53 (35%) of 150 patients in the placebo group had a pain flare (difference 8.9%, lower 95% confidence bound 0.0, one-sided p=0.05). Two grade 3 and one grade 4 biochemical hyperglycaemic events occurred in the dexamethasone group (without known clinical effects) compared with none in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were bone pain (61 [41%] of 147 vs 68 [48%] of 143), fatigue (58 [39%] of 147 vs 49 [34%] of 143), constipation (47 [32%] of 147 vs 37 [26%] of 143), and nausea (34 [23%] of 147 vs 34 [24%] of 143), most of which were mild grade 1 or 2.INTERPRETATION: Dexamethasone reduces radiation-induced pain flare in the treatment of painful bone metastases.FUNDING: The NCIC CTG's programmatic grant from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute.",Excluded

2533,"Substantia nigra stimulation influences monkey superior colliculus neuronal activity bilaterally. The inhibitory drive arising from the basal ganglia is thought to prevent the occurrence of orienting movements of the eyes, head, and body in monkeys and other mammals. The direct projection from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the superior colliculus (SC) mediates the inhibition. Since the original experiments in the SNr of monkeys the buildup or prelude neuron has been a focus of SC research. However, whether the SNr influences buildup neurons in SC is unknown. Furthermore, a contralateral SNr-SC pathway is evident in many species but remains unexplored in the alert monkey. Here we introduced electrical stimulation of one or both SNr nuclei while recording from SC buildup neurons. Stimulation of the SNr reduced the discharge rate of SC buildup neurons bilaterally. This result is consistent with activation of an inhibitory drive from SNr to SC. The time course of the influence of ipsilateral SNr on the activity of most SC neurons was longer (approximately 73 ms) than the influence of the contralateral SNr (approximately 34 ms). We also found that the variability of saccade onset time and saccade direction was altered with electrical stimulation of the SNr. Taken together our results show that electrical stimulation activates the inhibitory output of the SNr that in turn, reduces the activity of SC buildup neurons in both hemispheres. However, rather than acting as a gate for saccade initiation, the results suggest that the influence of SNr inhibition on visually guided saccades is more subtle, shaping the balance of excitation and inhibition across the SC.",Excluded

Background: Although the overall incidence of BM is not known, bone metastases are a frequent complication in pts with advanced lung cancer. Bone metastases can be associated with SREs, which include pathologic fracture, need for surgery or radiation to bone, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. The aim is to investigate prospectively the incidence of BM, the incidence and types of SREs, time interval between BM and SREs, influence of SREs on QOL, and predictive factor of SREs. Method(s): Eligibility criteria were a newly diagnosed pt with stage IIIB or IV lung cancer, age over 20 years old, written informed consent. Staging of lung cancer required CT scan of the whole body, bone scan or PET, and CT or MRI of the brain. Pts were closely followed up every 4 weeks to see if they developed SREs. During the follow up period, the pts underwent CT scan every 4 weeks, CT or MRI of the brain and bone scan or PET every 6 months.

3705,"Tactile situation awareness system: proprioceptive prostheses for sensory deficiencies. UNLABELLED: Pilots and astronauts do not experience spatial disorientation in normal day-to-day terrestrial activities. On the ground, the perception of position and motion is determined by central nervous system integration of concordant and redundant information from multiple sensory channels (somatosensory, vestibular and visual) which collectively yield veridical perceptions. In the acceleration environments experienced by pilots and astronauts, the somatosensory and vestibular senses frequently present false but concordant information concerning the direction of gravity or down. When presented with conflicting sensory stimuli, it is normal for pilots and astronauts to experience episodes of disorientation. Visual instruments and displays developed over the past 70 yr have not solved the problem. A simple solution to maintain spatial orientation is to provide true information using the same sensory channels we use so successfully on Earth.METHODS: The Tactile Situation Awareness System (TSAS) developed by NASA and the U.S. Navy uses a matrix of mechanical tactile stimulators (tactors) applied on the torso and limbs to convey orientation cues (e.g., gravity vector) in an intuitive fashion to the skin. A series of in-flight experiments to validate and test a variety of tactile displays and concepts has been carried out in both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.RESULTS: Pilots were able to fly complex maneuvers with no instruments or outside visual references (blindfolded) with less than 20 min of training. Recovery from unusual attitudes solely by tactile cues was trivial. Lab tests have shown the TSAS improves performance under conditions of high workload.CONCLUSIONS: When orientation information is presented via intuitive tactile displays spatial orientation is easily maintained in altered sensory conditions including unusual acceleration environments.",Excluded

MIITOP is a French multicenter trial whose objective is to evaluate the antitumor activity of an association of 131I-MIBG and Topotecan in refractory or relapse neuroblastomas. Two infusions of 131I-MIBG with 5 days Topotecan are scheduled. 444MBq/Kg of 131I-MIBG (with a maximum of 111000 MBq due to the French radioprotection limitations) is injected at the first course. A Whole body dosimetry is assessed using a ceiling counter and the MIRD model. The second dose of 131IMIBG is calculated to give a total whole body dose of 4 Gy. Stem cells are injected one month after the first dose. Fifteen patients were included at the end of 2011. Results. Dosimetry : Thirteen patients of 15 had a whole body dose of 2 Gy or more after the first course (2.02Gy - 4.78Gy). The 2 patients with less than 2 Gy received less than 444MBq/kg. The total dose after the two courses was between 3.75 and 4.94Gy. There is an important fluctuation of the whole body dose/MBq between patients. Conversely we observe a good stability of this parameter for a same patient. Toxicity : 4 patients showed a grade 4 hematological toxicity during more than 30 days (1 neutropenia, 5 thrombopenia and 1 anemia). No correlation was observed between this toxicity and the doses whether activity dose or radiation dose.Two serious adverse events occurred : one staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia and one fracture of a metastatic femur. No other adverse events were observed. Conclusion : The use of 444MBq/kg at the first course and the adaptation of the activity for the second course based on the radiation dose estimated by a ceiling counter and the MIRD Model to obtain a total whole body dose of 4 Gy is easily feasible, reliable and safe through a strict methodology.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) metastases are uncommon in patients with germ cell tumors, with an incidence of 2-3%. CNS metastases have been managed with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and concomitant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Our previous study did not observe serious CNS toxicity (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1991;22:17-22). We now report on 5 patients who developed delayed significant CNS toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed 5 patients with delayed CNS toxicity. The initial diagnosis was between 1981 and 2003. All patients had poor-risk disease according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Collaborative Group criteria. Of the 5 patients, 3 had CNS metastases at diagnosis and 2 developed relapses with CNS metastases. These 5 patients underwent WBRT to 4,000-5,000 cGy in 18-28 fractions concurrently with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.RESULTS: All 5 patients developed delayed symptoms consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The symptoms included seizures, hemiparesis, cranial neuropathy, headaches, blindness, dementia, and ataxia. The median time from WBRT to CNS symptoms was 72 months (range, 9-228). Head imaging revealed multiple abnormalities consistent with gliosis and diffuse cerebral atrophy. Of the 5 patients, 3 had progressive and 2 stable symptoms. Treatment with surgery and/or steroids had modest benefit. The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy resulted in significant debility in all 5 patients, resulting in death (3 patients), loss of work, steroid-induced morbidity, and recurrent hospitalizations.CONCLUSION: Whole brain radiotherapy is not innocuous in young patients with germ cell tumors and can cause late CNS toxicity.",Excluded

There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer.METHODS: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: We observed a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among the women who worked 1-14 years or 15-29 years on rotating night shifts (multivariate adjusted RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.99 to 1.18] and RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.90 to 1.30], respectively). The risk was further increased among women who worked 30 or more years on the night shift (RR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.78). The test for trend was statistically significant (P =.02).CONCLUSIONS: Women who work on rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month, in addition to days and evenings in that month, appear to have a moderately increased risk of breast cancer after extended periods of working rotating night shifts.",Excluded
430,"CT follow-up in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): combined radiation and contrast dose reduction. Background Frequent computed tomography (CT) follow-ups involve significant radiation related risks for patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Contrast agent (CA) application is essential for diagnostic evidence and has additional risks especially in patients with limited renal function. Purpose To investigate if a combination of dose and contrast agent (CA) reduction affects image quality and diagnostic evidence in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. Material and Methods A total of 51 NET patients were enrolled in the study and 153 CT scans were analyzed. Patients underwent a baseline CT scan (A = 120 kVp, filtered back projection [FBP]) and two follow-up CTs (B = 120 kVp, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASIR] 40%; C1 = 100 kVp, ASIR 40%; C2 = 100 kVp, ASIR 60%; the latter two protocols were applied with a 30% reduction in CA volume). We evaluated image quality and applied dose. Results In C1/2, the combination of low kV (100 kVp) with ASIR 40%/60% reduced the mean applied dose significantly by 28% compared to B and by 57% compared to A. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of tumor to liver/muscle were significantly increased by using C1/2 compared to B and A. With respect to subjective image quality, a slight loss of diagnostic confidence in C1 could be counterbalanced by the higher ASIR blending in C2. Conclusion Combined dose reduction techniques can be used to reduce radiation dose and CA volume without sacrificing image quality and diagnostic confidence in staging CT of NET patients.",Excluded
1817,"Tumor treating fields: A novel therapy for glioblastoma multiforme. Learning Objectives: To describe the rationale, indications, and literature supporting the use of Tumor Treating Fields in the first-line and second-line settings for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Main: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a novel anti-neoplastic treatment recently approved for clinical use for GBM. This new modality utilizes low intensity, intermediate frequency alternating electrical fields that have demonstrated anti-neoplastic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. The mechanism of action is postulated to include mitotic disruption at various points including dipole misalignment, impaired microtubule assembly, dielectrophoresis of intra-cellular molecules and organelle disruption, and asymmetric chromosome segregation. TTfields is delivered continuously to the brain by a patient-operated, wearable medical device (OptuneTM, Novocure Ltd.). A large (695 patients enrolled), international, randomized, phase 3 trial has recently confirmed the long-term efficacy of adding TTFields to standard maintenance chemotherapy after the completion of chemo-irradiation in newly diagnosed GBM. At 5-year follow-up, this trial demonstrated consistent superior tumor control (median PFS 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p = 0.00005) and significantly improved survival (median OS 20.9 vs. 16 months, 5-year OS 13% vs. 5%, p = 0.00006) with the addition of TTFields to the current standard of care therapy. The magnitude of improvement when adding TTFields is comparable to the benefit observed with adding chemotherapy to radiation (demonstrated over a decade ago). There was no significant toxicity observed with TTfields (most commonly, mild dermatitis), and patient-reported quality of life was unaffected. On subset analysis, both MGMT hypermethylation-positive and negative tumor subtypes were found to significantly benefit from TTF. In the second-line setting, a prior phase III trial has demonstrated equal efficacy but improved toxicity and quality of life profiles as compared to physician's choice of 2nd-line chemotherapy in GBM progressing after standard therapy. TTF is now endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for both the 1st line and 2nd-line setting in the treatment of GBM.",Excluded
214,"Comparison of 32P therapy and sequential hemibody irradiation (HBI) for bony metastases as methods of whole body irradiation. We report a retrospective study of 15 patients with prostate carcinoma and diffuse bone metastases treated with sodium 32P for palliation of pain at Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital from 1973 to 1978. The response rates, duration of response, and toxicities are compared with those of other series of patients treated with 32P and with sequential hemibody irradiation. The response rates and duration of response are similar with both modalities ranging from 58 to 95% with a duration of 3.3 to 6 months with 32P and from 75 to 86% with a median duration of 5.5 months with hemibody irradiation. There are significant differences in the patterns of response and in the toxicities of the two treatment methods. Both methods cause significant bone marrow depression. Acute radiation syndrome, radiation pneumonitis, and alopecia are seen with sequential hemibody irradiation and not with 32P, but their incidence can be reduced by careful treatment planning. Hemibody irradiation can provide pain relief within 24 to 48 h, while 32P may produce an initial exacerbation of pain. Lower hemibody irradiation alone is less toxic than either upper hemibody irradiation or 32P treatment.",Excluded
1076,"Postradiation osteonecrosis of the mandible: a long-term follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the long-term progress of 26 patients who experienced postradiation osteonecrosis of the jaw between 1975 and 1989.STUDY DESIGN: Of 26 patients who had been previously managed with hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a part of their treatment for postradiation osteonecrosis of the jaw, 20 were evaluated to determine their current status of the condition: resolved, chronic persisting (unresolved), or active progressive (symptomatic).RESULTS: Two of 20 patients experienced recurrences of the condition. In one of these patients, surgical treatment was identified as the stimulus of postradiation osteonecrosis. In the other patient, the recurrence appeared to be related to periodontal disease activity. In 60% (12 of 20) of the patients, the condition remained resolved, improvement in clinical staging occurred in 10% (2 of 20) (from symptomatic to unresolved or resolved), and 20% (5 of 20) of the patients continued to demonstrate chronic persisting postradiation osteonecrosis at the end of the long-term follow-up period.CONCLUSION: This study supports the contention that postradiation osteonecrosis can occur at any time after radiation therapy, and that patients remain at risk up to 231 months after treatment of the cancer and probably indefinitely after radiation therapy. Our findings also suggest that risk of second episodes of the condition after management of an initial episode is low. In addition, our follow-up study revealed that chronic nonprogressive postradiation osteonecrosis can remain stable without extensive intervention including combined hyperbaric oxygen therapy and surgery.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: To evaluate <sup>106</sup>Ruthenium Brachytherapy in management of medium sized uveal melanoma, with emphasis on 5-year outcome and toxicity.METHODS: From April 2007 to October 2015, 39 patients with medium sized uveal melanoma were treated with 106 Ru eye plaques brachytherapy. At the time of diagnosis, the mean tumor depth was 3.7 mm (+/-SD:1.6 mm). The mean dose at the tumor apex was 141.4 Gy (+/- SD: 12.1 Gy) and 557.7 Gy (+/- SD: 257.3 Gy) to the sclera.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 69.5 months (+/- SD: 53.8 months). Thirty-four patients (87.1%) remained free of recurrence. Twenty-six patients (66.7%) demonstrated a complete tumor regression after a median period of 12 months (3-60 mon.). By the final examination, the visual acuity of 26 patients (66.7%) was better than 20/200, and 12 patients (30.7%) had a visual acuity better than 20/40. Retinopathy was detected in 11 patients (28.2%). After treatments only one patient (5.1%) had active vascular changes by the last examination. Moderate optic neuropathy was observed in 4 patients (10.3%). Cataract development was diagnosed in 21 patients (53.8%), and 16 patients (41%) had bilateral cataract development. Special emphasis was made on patients with larger tumors. Twelve out of the 39 patients had a tumor with a depth of 5 mm or more. There was no significant difference in local control or in side effects between both groups observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our study proved <sup>106</sup>Ru -brachytherapy to be an excellent treatment option with regard to tumor control and preservation of the visual acuity in well-selected patients.

2722,"Cranial irradiation significantly reduces beta amyloid plaques in the brain and improves cognition in a murine model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate if cranial X-irradiation reduces amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and influences cognitive function in a transgenic mouse model of AD.METHODS AND MATERIALS: B6.Cg-Tg (APPswePSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J AD-prone mice were given cranial X-irradiation. The number of Abeta plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1beta, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Abeta burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task.RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Abeta plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy x 10), 72% (2 Gy x 5) and 78% (2 Gy x 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001). The reduction in Abeta burden (2 Gy x 5) was associated with cognitive improvement (p=0.012).CONCLUSION: This is the first report that a clinically relevant course of external beam irradiation (2 Gy x 5) produces a significant reduction in AD-associated amyloid-beta plaques with a subsequent improvement in cognitive function. However, longer-term studies are needed to define the precise underlying mechanism and longevity of this response.",Excluded
179,"Postoperative radiation for lung cancer metastatic to the brain. PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied.",Included

1109,"The oncogene BCL6 is up-regulated in glioblastoma in response to DNA damage, and drives survival after therapy. The prognosis for people with the high-grade brain tumor glioblastoma is very poor, due largely to low cell death in response to genotoxic therapy. The transcription factor BCL6, a protein that normally suppresses the DNA damage response during immune cell maturation, and a known driver of B-cell lymphoma, was shown to mediate the survival of glioblastoma cells. Expression was observed in glioblastoma tumor specimens and cell lines. When BCL6 expression or activity was reduced in these lines, increased apoptosis and a profound loss of proliferation was observed, consistent with gene expression signatures suggestive of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signaling role for BCL6 in glioblastoma. Further, treatment with the standard therapies for glioblastoma-ionizing radiation and temozolomide-both induced BCL6 expression in vitro, and an in vivo orthotopic animal model of glioblastoma. Importantly, inhibition of BCL6 in combination with genotoxic therapies enhanced the therapeutic effect. Together these data demonstrate that BCL6 is an active transcription factor in glioblastoma, that it drives survival of cells, and that it increased with DNA damage, which increased the survival rate of therapy-treated cells. This makes BCL6 an excellent therapeutic target in glioblastoma-by increasing sensitivity to standard DNA damaging therapy, BCL6 inhibitors have real potential to improve the outcome for people with this disease.",Excluded
2550,"Molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity in malignant glioma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by rapidly proliferating and invasive cells that infiltrate normal brain regions. Following exposure to aggressive treatment regimens, GBMs frequently shift their biological features upon recurrence, acquiring a more resistant phenotype. However, the dynamics and molecular mechanisms that facilitate GBM recurrence are still poorly understood. The objective our study was to determine how glioma stem cells (GSCs) temporally adjust their expression profile and phenotype in response to ionizing radiation or Temozolomide (TMZ) in vivo using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GBM. We established two PDX GBM models by intracranially implanting two patient-derived GSC lines belonging to different GBM molecular subgroups (proneural and classical) into immunocompromised mice. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with single or multiple doses of ionizing radiation or TMZ to assess acute and long-term responses to treatment respectively. Mice from each cohort were be sacrificed at multiple distinct time points following treatment. Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed changes in the expression of GBM subclass markers, stemness and differentiation markers, and DNA damage/repair proteins across the entire tumor population over time. Furthermore, to understand how the PDX tumors respond to radiation at a molecular level, we employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) and ChIP-seq to determine how important cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional programs necessary for GSC selfrenewal, invasion and growth are altered at various time points post-treatment. We demonstrate that GSCs undergo an immediate response following exposure to radiation that results in a global modulation of the expression of key stemness and proliferation genes under adverse conditions. Our results suggest that this acute response allows GSCs to enter a transient semi-differentiated state that favors GSC adaptability and resistance to therapy.",Excluded
3628,"Medical Event Management for Future Deep Space Exploration Missions to Mars. BACKGROUND: Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), such as voyages to Mars, will present unique medical challenges for astronaut crews, including communication delays and the inability to return to Earth early. Medical events threaten crewmember lives and increase the risk of mission failure. Managing a range of potential medical events will require excellent technical and nontechnical skills (NTSs). We sought to identify medical events with potential for rescue, range them according to the potential impact on crew health and mission success during LDEMs, and develop a list of NTSs to train for management of in-flight medical events.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subject matter experts with specializations in surgery, medicine, trauma, spaceflight operations, NTS training, simulation, human factors, and organizational psychology completed online surveys followed by a 2-d in-person workshop. They identified and rated medical events for survivability, mission impact, and impact of crewmember NTSs on outcomes in space.RESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest, smoke inhalation, toxic exposure, seizure, and penetrating eye injury emerged as events with the highest potential mission impact, greatest potential for survival, and that required excellent NTS for successful management. Key NTS identified to target in training included information exchange, supporting behavior, communication delivery, and team leadership/followership.CONCLUSIONS: With a planned Mars mission on the horizon, training countermeasures need to be developed in the next 3-5 y. These results may inform policy, selection, medical system design, and training scenarios for astronauts to manage in-flight medical events on LDEMs. Findings may extend to surgical and medical care in any rural and remote location.",Excluded

1284,"Monitoring radiation treatment effects in glioblastoma: Are changes in flair volume prognostic?. Purpose/Objective(s): Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity is believed to represent microscopic infiltration of tumor in glioblastoma (GBM), but is also affected by post-treatment changes. Numerous studies have evaluated the relationship between FLAIR volume and clinical outcomes, but results have been mixed. We sought to develop an objective measure of FLAIR volume that was independent of user input and not influenced by digital contrast adjustment. Using this automated method of image analysis, we evaluated the relationship between pre-radiation FLAIR volume and post-radiation changes in FLAIR volume in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed FLAIR imaging data from 56 consecutive GBM patients treated at a single institution between January 2012 and December 2013. An increase in FLAIR signal was defined as voxels 2 standard deviations above the median intensity value across the entire brain-extracted volume. This automated process was performed on the post-resection, pre-radiation MRI scan as well as all available post-radiation FLAIR sequences. The volume of voxels reaching this threshold was computed for all sequences. All patient charts were reviewed to compute the PFS, which was defined as any radiographic or clinical progression leading to a recommendation to change or stop treatment. Result(s): Of 56 patients, 24 (43%) were female and the median age was 60.5 years (range 16 e 85). Our analysis failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between the initial FLAIR volume and overall survival or clinically defined PFS. The change in FLAIR volume after radiation therapy as a function of time was also not related to these clinical outcome measures. The lack of a significant association between these measures was also true when using a more stringent threshold of FLAIR hyperintensity (5 standard deviations above the mean). Conclusion(s): With the assumption that FLAIR signal represents inflammatory edema caused by tumor infiltration into otherwise healthy tissue, many studies have attempted to correlate FLAIR volume with OS and PFS in the post-treatment setting. Results of these studies have varied, and the prognostic value of FLAIR volume has yet to be clearly demonstrated in glioblastoma. Using an automated and objective volumetric measure, we found no significant correlation between clinical outcomes and changes in FLAIR volume, a measure that is often used in routine MRI surveillance in the post-treatment setting. Our results suggest that gross edema volumes cannot directly predict PFS or OS.",Excluded
2070,"Cost-Effectiveness of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus MRI Surveillance for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer. Purpose: Owing to conflicting prospective data, controversy exists regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for patients with ES-SCLC based on currently available evidence and in the context of the proposed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services alternative payment model. Methods and Materials: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing MRI surveillance alone with PCI for ES-SCLC. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data, and cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to consider model uncertainty. Result(s): In the base-case scenario, PCI was not cost-effective in this model, with an ICER of $168,456 per QALY gained compared with MRI surveillance alone, assuming that overall survival was 10 months for MRI surveillance alone and 12.5 months for PCI. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the variation of overall survival and cognitive decline rates between the 2 groups. In a scenario analysis in which all patients received hippocampal-avoidance PCI, the model results became nearly cost-effective with PCI. Conclusion(s): PCI was not found to be cost-effective within this model compared with MRI surveillance alone, owing to the neurocognition decline effect of PCI based on available evidence. Hippocampal-avoidance PCI may be a potential cost-effective strategy for ES-SCLC, with confirmation expected after an ongoing prospective clinical trial (The Southwest Oncolology Group MRI Brain Surveillance Alone Versus MRI Surveillance And Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation [MAVERICK]), which includes assessments of cognitive function.

OBJECT: Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for patients with melanoma in whom brain metastases have developed. Very limited data are available on treating patients with >=5 lesions. The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of SRS in patients with >=5 melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma treated with SRS in a single treatment session for >=5 lesions was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were reviewed post-SRS to evaluate local control (LC). Disease progression on imaging was defined using the 2009 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Survival curves were calculated from the date of brain metastases diagnosis or the date of SRS by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate and multivariate analysis (UVA and MVA, respectively) were performed using the Cox proportional-hazards model.RESULTS: The authors identified 149 metastatic brain lesions treated in 28 patients. The median patient age was 60.5 years (range 38-83 years), and the majority of patients (24 [85.7%]) had extracranial metastases. Four patients (14.3%) had received previous whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and 11 (39.3%) had undergone previous SRS. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 0.34 cm3 (range 0.01-12.5 cm3). Median follow-up was 6.3 months (range 1-46 months). At the time of treatment, 7% of patients were categorized as recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I, 89% as RPA Class II, and 4% as RPA Class III. The rate of local failure was 11.4%. Kaplan-Meier LC estimates at 6 and 12 months were 91.3% and 82.2%, respectively. A PTV volume>=0.34 cm3 was a significant predictor of local failure on UVA (HR 16.1, 95% CI 3.2-292.6, p<0.0001) and MVA (HR 14.8, 95% CI 3.0-268.5, p=0.0002). Sixteen patients (57.1%) were noted to have distant failure in the brain with a median time to failure of 3 months (range 1-15 months). Nine patients with distant failures received WBRT, and 7 received additional SRS. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.4 and 7.6 months from the date of brain metastases diagnosis and the date of SRS, respectively. The KM OS estimates at 6 and 12 months were 57.8% and 28.2%, respectively, from the time of SRS treatment. The RPA class was a significant predictor of KM OS estimates from the date of treatment (p=0.02). Patients who did not receive WBRT after SRS treatment had decreased OS on MVA (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-12.0, p=0.03), and patients who did not receive WBRT prior to SRS had improved OS (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.53, p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery for >=5 lesions appears to be effective for selected patients with metastatic melanoma, offering excellent LC. This is particularly important for patients as new targeted systemic agents are improving outcomes but still have limited efficacy within the central nervous system.",Excluded

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) on cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma (CSCH) and to analyze the temporal volume change. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 26 CSCH patients who were treated with GKS between 2001 and 2017. Before GKS, 11 patients (42.3%) had cranial neuropathies and 5 patients (19.2%) complained of headache, whereas 10 patients (38.5%) were initially as-ymptomatic. The mean pre-GKS mass volume was 9.3 mL (range, 0.5-31.6 mL), and the margin dose ranged from 13 to 15 Gy according to the mass volume and the proximity to the optic pathway. All cranial neuropathy patients and half of headache patients showed clinical improvement. All 26 patients achieved mass control; remarkable responses (less than 1/3 of the initial mass vol-ume) were shown in 19 patients (73.1%) and moderate responses (more than 1/3 and less than 2/3) in 7 patients (26.9%). The mean final mass volume after GKS was 1.8 mL (range, 0-12.6 mL). The mean mass volume at 6 months after GKS was 45% (range, 5-80%) compared to the mass volume before GKS and 21% (range, 0-70%) at 12 months. The higher radiation dose tended to in-duce more rapid and greater volume reduction. No treatment-related complication was observed during the follow-up period.

1614,"Automated image enhancement (clarityiq) to reduce radiation dosage without loss of image quality. Background: Excess radiation exposure is related with adverse events. Therefore the allowed radiation dosage for healthcare workers is regulated by governing agencies. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle still applies. ClarityIQ is an automated algorithm developed to reduce the radiation dosage used without loss of image quality. Method(s): Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure). Images were reviewed by three independent reviewers and scored on subjective image quality, good, fair, poor. Result(s): Our preliminary data demonstrate that 47 patients (mean age 62.8 +/- 11.1) were enrolled with a mean BMI of 26.6 kg/m2 +/- 3.7.

Independent reviewers assessed the images as good in 29, fair in 18 and poor in none. Reduction in mean DAP was 58%, mean DAP of ClarityIQ was 1126 mGy.cm2 and 1955 mGy.cm2 for the standard image acquisition. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm, adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 58% of radiation dose. Thus resulting in less stochastic effects of radiation for the cath-lab personnel and also less deterministic effects for the patient. Further research is needed to assess whether ClarityIQ is also suitable for large patients and different angulations.",Excluded
3684,"Efficacy of granisetron and aprepitant in a patient who failed ondansetron in the prophylaxis of radiation induced nausea and vomiting: A case report. Introduction: Radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) is a toxicity that can occur in 40-80 % of individuals who receive radiation treatment. Current guidelines recommend 5-hydroxytryptamine<inf>3</inf> receptor antagonists (5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs) for prophylaxis of RINV for moderate and highly emetogenic radiotherapy; however, certain patients may suffer from RINV despite prophylaxis. Objective(s): To determine if switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs is successful in the treatment and further prophylaxis of RINV. Method(s): This report details the case of a 47-year-old female with extensive bony involvement to the spine from breast cancer presenting with lower back pain. To palliate her symptoms, the patient underwent a course of irradiation to the lumbar spine and was prescribed ondansetron as an antiemetic. However, the patient experienced severe nausea and emesis and was subsequently switched to granisetron and aprepitant. Result(s): The patient completed the remainder of the radiation treatment with no further emesis and minimal nausea, representing the first documented success of granisetron and aprepitant for RINV after failure on ondansetron. Conclusion(s): In chemotherapy, switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs after failure on the first is successful in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), yet this has not been previously observed in radiation. In this patient, granisetron and aprepitant were successful in substantially reducing nausea and preventing further emesis, and may represent an alternative antiemetic regimen for RINV prophylaxis and salvage.

1330,"CyberKnife frameless single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for tumors of the sacrum. OBJECT: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial lesions is well established. The experience with radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal and sacral lesions is more limited. Sacral lesions should be amenable to radiosurgical treatment similar to that used for their intracranial counterparts. The authors evaluated a single- fraction radiosurgical technique performed using the CyberKnife Real-Time Image-Guided Radiosurgery System for the treatment of the sacral lesion. METHOD(S): The CyberKnife is a frameless radiosurgery system based on the coupling of an orthogonal pair of x-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator possessing six degrees of freedom, which guides the therapy beam to the intended target without the need for frame-based fixation. All sacral lesions were located and tracked for radiation delivery relative to fiducial bone markers placed percutaneously. Eighteen patients were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery. Tumor histology included one benign and 17 malignant tumors. Dose plans were calculated based on computerized tomography scans acquired using 1.25-mm slices. Planning treatment volume was defined as the radiographically documented tumor volume with no margin. Tumor dose was maintained at 12 to 20 Gy to the 80% isodose line (mean 15 Gy). Tumor volume ranged from 23.6 to 187.4 ml (mean 90 ml). The volume of the cauda equina receiving greater than 8 Gy ranged from 0 to 1 ml (mean 0.1 ml). All patients underwent the procedure in an outpatient setting. No acute radiation toxicity or new neurological deficits occurred during the mean follow-up period of 6 months. Pain improved in all 13 patients who were symptomatic prior to treatment. No tumor progression has been documented on follow-up imaging. CONCLUSION(S): Stereotactic radiosurgery was found to be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of both benign and malignant sacral lesions. The major potential benefits of radiosurgical ablation of sacral lesions are relatively short treatment time in an outpatient setting and minimal or no side effects. This new technique offers a new and important therapeutic modality for the primary treatment of a variety of sacral tumors or for lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques.",Excluded
3601,"Longitudinal Analysis of Quantitative Brain MRI in Astronauts Following Microgravity Exposure. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Assessment of the effects of microgravity on astronauts' brains using microstructural measures by utilizing quantitative MRI, before and after spaceflight would help understand the structural changes.METHODS: Quantitative MRI data sets in 19 astronauts were acquired before and after space missions. Both diffusion tensor metrics and volumetric measures were analyzed in the brain regions involved in the visual function.RESULTS: The fractional anisotropy was reduced in the right posterior thalamic radiations (P = .0009) and remained significant after a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (P = .03). A trend of increase in the mean diffusivities of different subregions of the occipital cortex on the right side, including calcarine, middle occipital, inferior occipital, and fusiform gyri, was noted and became insignificant after FDR correction. Similarly, there was a trend of cortical thinning involving the right occipital lobe and bilateral fusiform gyri, volume reduction of the left thalamus, and increase in lateral ventricular volume in the postflight scans.CONCLUSION: Gray and white matter alterations are detected by quantitative MRI before and after space flight. Our findings may be used to understand the neuroanatomical mechanisms of possible brain dysfunction or neuroplasticity in microgravity condition in the future studies.",Excluded

94,"Intracranial venous sinus stenosis: Hemodynamic assessment with two-dimensional parametric parenchymal blood flow software on digital subtraction angiography. Objective Intracranial venous sinus stenosis (IVSS) is the most common finding associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A pressure gradient >8-10 mm Hg across the stenosis is considered hemodynamically significant, and typically responds to endovascular stent treatment. Here we assess the venous hemodynamics with two-dimensional (2D) parametric parenchymal blood flow software (Siemens-Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) and its ability to predict significant IVSS. Methods Patients with IVSS treated at our institution between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Measurements of contrast transit time on DSA were calculated with 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software. Values were obtained proximally and distally to the stenotic region. Venous Stenosis Index (VSI) was defined as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) in the pre-stenotic vessel to the AUC in the post-stenotic vessel. VSI was compared between the stenotic and control groups at baseline, and before and after stent deployment in the stenotic group. The accuracy of VSI was assessed using the non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results 11 patients with IVSS treated with venous stent deployment were included. Patients in the control group were similar in age, gender, and absence of major comorbidities. VSI in the IVSS group was significantly higher at baseline compared with the control group (1.42 vs 0.97, p=0.01). Area under the ROC was 0.82. After stent deployment, VSI decreased significantly compared with baseline (1.04 vs 1.42, p<0.01). Conclusion 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software is a useful tool which can accurately evaluate significant hemodynamic venous stenosis without intracranial catheterization, added radiation exposure, additional contrast injection, and periprocedural risks.

3410,"Weak MGMT gene promoter methylation confers a clinically significant survival benefit in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma: a retrospective cohort study. INTRODUCTION: Quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) is a frequently used technique to assess MGMT gene promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients. The optimal technical cut-off value to distinguish methylated from unmethylated samples is nevertheless still undetermined. In literature, a ""grey zone"" of diagnostic uncertainty has been described.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated according to the Stupp protocol. Epidemiological data were gathered from the individual patient files. MGMT gene promoter methylation status was determined on stored tumour samples using qMSP. A strong, weak or absent promoter methylation was determined based on Cq values (quantification value) of the MGMT and ACTB primers as well as a positive control sample.RESULTS: In total, 181 patient files were reviewed and included for statistical analysis. MGMT promoter hypermethylation was detected in 38.7% of glioblastoma patients. The median overall survival of unmethylated and strongly methylated patients was 10.1 months and 19.7 months respectively. Furthermore, 11% of the total patient cohort had a weak MGMT gene promoter methylation. The median OS in this subgroup was 15.4 months, significantly better compared to the unmethylated cohort (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed weak MGMT promoter methylation as an independent prognostic parameter for overall survival.CONCLUSION: Glioblastoma patients with weak promoter methylation show a statistically significant longer overall survival when compared to clearly unmethylated patients. Patients with grey zone qMSP test results should receive additional molecular analysis in future to further direct individual therapy strategies.",Excluded
3847,"Empirical vs risk-based approach to intracavernosal injection therapy: A prospective study. Objectives: Intracavernosal injection (ICI) therapy is widely used for ED. Employing it in practice is largely empirical and has not been validated with evidence-based approaches. This study compares two strategies for ICI to determine whether a risk-based approach is more efficacious, increases satisfaction and/or results in fewer treatment complications. Method(s): After obtaining IRB approval, a prospective database of patients enrolled in the ICI program at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from May 2012-present was amassed. Demographic information, treatment outcomes and subjective patient evaluations of sexual function (IIEF, QEQ, SQoL and EDITS questionnaires) were obtained at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Two approaches were compared. Group 1 consisted of empiric ICI treatment. Patients were treated with Prostaglandin E1 10 mcg, irrespective of ED etiology or severity, and only if poor response noted at test injection, then initiated on bimix or trimix. Group 2 was a risk-based approach, where using an algorithm that factored in: organic vs. neurogenic ED, number of ED risk factors, prostatectomy, nerve-sparing status, time from surgery and radiation status, patients were treated with either bimix, low- or high-dose trimix. Dose titration was permitted in both groups. Statistical analysis was carried out using t-test and chi-squared analysis. Result(s): 175 patients were enrolled (57 in Group 1, 118 in Group 2) with 3 and 6 month f/u at 57% and 35% respectively, and similar between groups. Baseline patient characteristics and sexual function questionnaire responses were similar between groups 1 and 2, (mean age 61.9 vs. 61.3 p = 0.66, IIEF-EF 8.1 vs. 6.9 p = 0.28, and SQoL 37.7 vs. 39.2 p = 0.71), though Group 1 reported higher quality erections at baseline (QEQ 14.3 vs. 7.3 p = 0.05) and had a lower proportion of post-prostatectomy patients 54.4% vs. 74.6% (p = 0.02). In both groups, quality of erections (QEQ) improved with treatment (mean 10.78 vs. 56.76, p < 0.05), SQoL improved (38.41 vs. 50.25, p < 0.05), and IIEF-EF improved (7.51 vs. 18.48, p < 0.05). However, between groups at 3 and 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in responses for IIEF, QEQ, SQoL or EDITS, and no difference in failure or medication switch rates. There were no significant differences in complication rates, though at 3 months group 2 reported a higher incidence of priapism and pain (23% vs. 7.4% p = 0.08).

Complications rates, satisfaction and efficacy overall were similar between both approaches.",Excluded
1888,"Electrohypersensitivity: state-of-the-art of a functional impairment. Recently, a new category of persons, claiming to suffer from exposure to electromagnetic fields, has been described in the literature. In Sweden, electrohypersensitivity (EHS) is an officially fully recognized functional impairment (i.e., it is not regarded as a disease). Survey studies show that somewhere between 230,000-290,000 Swedish men and women report a variety of symptoms when being in contact with electromagnetic field (EMF) sources. The aim of our studies has been to investigate possible alterations, in the cellular and neuronal systems of these person' skin. As controls, age- and sex-matched persons, without any subjective or clinical symptoms or dermatological history, served. Immunohistochemistry using antisera to the previously characterized marker substances of interest has been utilized. In summary, it is evident from our preliminary data that various alterations are present in the electrohypersensitive person' skin. In view of recent epidemiological studies, pointing to a correlation between long-term exposure from power-frequent magnetic fields or microwaves and cancer, our data ought to be taken seriously and further analyzed.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether a disease site-specific, multi-institutional knowledge based-planning (KBP) model can improve the quality of intensity modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for patients enrolled in the head and neck NRG-HN001clinical trial and to establish a threshold of improvements of treatment plans submitted to the clinical trial. Methods and Materials: Fifty treatment plans for patients enrolled in the NRG-HN001 clinical trial were used to build a KBP model; the model was then used to reoptimize 50 other plans. We compared the dosimetric parameters of the submitted and KBP reoptimized plans. We compared differences between KBP and submitted plans for single- and multi-institutional treatment plans. Result(s): Mean values for the dose received by 95% of the planning target volume (PTV_6996) and for the maximum dose (D0.03cc) of PTV_6996 were 0.5 Gy and 2.1 Gy higher in KBP plans than in the submitted plans, respectively. Mean values for D0.03cc to the brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerve_R, optic nerve_L, and chiasm were 2.5 Gy, 1.9 Gy, 6.4 Gy, 6.6 Gy, and 5.7 Gy lower in the KBP plans than in the submitted plans. Mean values for D<inf>mean</inf> to parotid_R and parotid_L glands were 2.2 Gy and 3.8 Gy lower in KBP plans, respectively. In 33 out of 50 KBP plans, we observed improvements in sparing of at least 7 organs at risk (OARs) (brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerves (R & L), chiasm, and parotid glands [R & L]). A threshold of improvement of OARs sparing of 5% of the prescription dose was established for providing the quality assurance results back to the treating institution. Conclusion(s): A disease site-specific, multi-institutional, clinical trial-based KBP model improved sparing of OARs in a large number of reoptimized plans submitted to the NRG-HN001 clinical trial, and the model is being used as an offline quality assurance tool.

956,"Management of patients with recurrent glioblastoma using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. The chance of cure is very limited due to treatment-refractory disease course with frequent recurrences despite aggressive multimodality management. In this retrospective study, we evaluated treatment outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) in the management of recurrent GBM and report our single-center experience. Method(s): Twenty-eight patients receiving HFSRT for recurrent GBM between September 2008 and February 2014 were retrospectively assessed. Total radiotherapy dose was 25 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days for all patients. High-precision, image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy was delivered with a linear accelerator using 6-MV photons using the frameless technique. Analyzed prognostic factors were age, gender, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), tumor location, planning target volume (PTV) size, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time interval between completion of treatment with Stupp protocol at primary diagnosis and recurrence. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 42 months (range 2-68). Median time interval between primary chemoradiotherapy and HFSRT was 11.2 months (range 4-57.9). Median OS and PFS calculated from reirradiation was 10.3 months and 5.8 months, respectively. Longer interval between initial treatment and recurrence (p = 0.01), smaller PTV size (p = 0.001), KPS >=70 (p = 0.005) and younger age (p = 0.004) were associated with longer OS on statistical analysis. Conclusion(s): HFSRT offers a feasible and effective salvage treatment option for recurrent GBM management. Prognostic factors associated with longer OS in our study were longer interval between initial treatment and recurrence, smaller PTV size, KPS >=70 and younger age.

2280,"The effect of increasing concentrations of intracranial albumin on fluid flow rates within adjacent white matter tracts in rats. BACKGROUND: In most systemic cancers, tumor cells are passively carried by extracellular fluid flow to regional lymph nodes. However, the mechanism of glioma cell dissemination remains controversial, as the brain does not contain a lymphatic system. Because malignant brain tumors are characterized by a disrupted blood-brain-barrier that leaks albumin from blood vessels into brain parenchyma, we hypothesize that this albumin influx will pull water in osmotically and increase flow rates and glioma cell dissemination down adjacent white matter tracts. This may have implications for future radiation planning and steroid/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor dosing. METHOD(S): Our study examines flow rates in white matter tracts after intracranial administration of albumin. We mixed 0.12-6 mg bovine albumin with 20 muL of 2% Evans Blue and injected the mixture stereotactically into the right frontal lobes of 15 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley female rats at the gray-white matter junction over 80 minutes. Seven hours later, the rats were killed and their brains sectioned into 0.5 mm coronal slices and imaged to determine interstitial flow rates. RESULT(S): All animals tolerated the infusion without difficulty. The entire brain was white except at the site of injection and in ipsilateral white matter tracts, especially the external capsule. Average flow rates (mm/hour) for rats receiving 0.12 mg of albumin were 0.43 (coronal) and 0.13 (axial) and for those receiving 6 mg albumin were 0.99 (coronal) and 0.23 (axial). Positive correlation was observed between albumin dose administered and interstitial fluid flow rates (R = 0.57 coronal and 0.36 axial). CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates higher interstitial fluid flow rates in adjacent white matter tracts in response to albumininduced- edema. These observations provide insight into expected pathways for glioma dissemination that could be used to tailor radiation plans for individual patients. Furthermore, these findings provide a rationale for interventions to reduce glioma dissemination by limiting the extravasation of albumin through the blood-brain-barrier while local radiation is being administered.",Excluded
2029,"Analysis of the feeding motor pattern in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis: photoinactivation of axonally stained pattern-generating interneurons. We have photoinactivated identified feeding interneurons known as N1 and N2 neurons. These are pattern-generating neurons that are active in the protraction of the radula and rasping phases, respectively, of the feeding cycle of the pond snail. The N1 or N2 feeding interneurons in the buccal ganglia were filled with the fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF) from the cut end of the nerve that contains their axon. Filling the cerebrobuccal connective (N = 151) stained just one N1 cell in the contralateral buccal ganglion. Filling the postbuccal nerve stained neurons symmetrically in both buccal ganglia (N = 75): only one labeled cell in each ganglion is an N2 interneuron. The feeding rhythm was evoked by depolarizing a modulatory neuron, the SO, located in the buccal ganglia. The axonally filled N1 interneuron was irradiated at its axon in the buccal commissure with blue laser light (intensity of 0.5 MW.m-2). Irradiation of just one N1 completely blocked the feeding rhythm (seven preparations). In seven further preparations, N1 ablation slowed the SO-driven feeding rhythm and weakened the N1 input to the feeding neurons. Irradiation of the cell bodies of both the filled left and right N2 interneurons killed the cells but did not produce any consistent change in the feeding rate (15 preparations). The feeding interneurons and motoneurons still showed the characteristic N2 phase synaptic inputs, so more, as yet unidentified, N2 neurons must be located in other parts of the buccal ganglia. We conclude that the participation of the identified N1 interneurons is essential for the normal feeding pattern while other, still to be identified N2 neurons must be present and must contribute to the feeding rhythm. We suggest that the extra redundancy of the N2 network may be related to the greater necessity of sensory feedback control during rasping than during protraction of the radula.",Excluded
3079,"The role of mislocalized phototransduction in photoreceptor cell death of retinitis pigmentosa. Most of inherited retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) cause photoreceptor cell death resulting in blindness. RP is a large family of diseases in which the photoreceptor cell death can be caused by a number of pathways. Among them, light exposure has been reported to induce photoreceptor cell death. However, the detailed mechanism by which photoreceptor cell death is caused by light exposure is unclear. In this study, we have shown that even a mild light exposure can induce ectopic phototransduction and result in the acceleration of rod photoreceptor cell death in some vertebrate models. In ovl, a zebrafish model of outer segment deficiency, photoreceptor cell death is associated with light exposure. The ovl larvae show ectopic accumulation of rhodopsin and knockdown of ectopic rhodopsin and transducin rescue rod photoreceptor cell death. However, knockdown of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that mediates the next step of phototransduction, does not. So, ectopic phototransduction activated by light exposure, which leads to rod photoreceptor cell death, is through the action of transducin. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that forced activation of adenylyl cyclase in the inner segment leads to rod photoreceptor cell death. For further confirmation, we have also generated a transgenic fish which possesses a human rhodopsin mutation, Q344X. This fish and rd10 model mice show photoreceptor cell death caused by adenylyl cyclase. In short, our study indicates that in some RP, adenylyl cyclase is involved in photoreceptor cell death pathway; its inhibition is potentially a logical approach for a novel RP therapy.",Excluded

2252,"Stereotactic Radiosurgery in the Treatment of Recurrent CNS Lymphoma. Background Central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) is typically treated with chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Optimal management of recurrent CNSL is poorly defined. Objective We aim to determine the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of recurrent CNSL. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent intracranial CNSL between 1999 and 2011. Results Fourteen patients (20 tumors) underwent SRS. The median patient age was 71 years (range, 18-82 years). Seven patients (50%) had primary CNSL. All had received prior chemotherapy, and nine patients (64%) had undergone prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with a median dose of 40 Gy in 25 fractions. The median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score was 80. The median tumor volume was 6.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 0.5-37.7); the median margin dose was 15.5 Gy (range, 10-18). Eleven patients (79%) had tumor regression (n = 11) shown on MRI after SRS. The median overall survival after SRS was 9.5 months. No patient had a major radiation-related complication. Conclusion Stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with recurrent CNSL is well tolerated and has a high rate of radiographic response. A marginal dose of 15.5 Gy or greater, a Karnofsky score of 80 or greater, and the absence of pre-SRS WBRT were associated with significantly longer overall survival. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be beneficial as an initial salvage therapy in the treatment of recurrent CNSL for properly selected patients. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, depletion of dopamine in the striatum and the presence of Lewy bodies. Cancer is uncontrolled growth of cells in the body and migration of these cells from their site of origin to other parts of the body. PD and cancer are two opposite diseases, one arising from cell proliferation and the other from cell degeneration. This fundamental difference is consistent with inverse comorbidity between most cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. However, a positive association of PD and melanoma has been reported which has recently become of significant interest. A link between PD and cancer has been supported by many epidemiological studies, most of which show that PD patients have a lower risk of developing most cancers than the general population. However, the mechanisms underlying this epidemiological observation are not known. In this review we focus on epidemiological studies correlating PD and melanoma and the possible mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of the two diseases. We explore possible explanations for the important observations that more PD patients develop melanoma that would otherwise be expected and vice-versa. Copyright © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS) in controlling procedural breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) in advanced cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved 62 advanced cancer patients, with well-controlled background pain, who presented BTCP associated to routine radiotherapy procedures, treated with FPNS according to our protocol of administration. The BPE intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS).RESULTS: The BTCP was triggered during the computed tomography simulation (79.3%) or treatment delivery (20.7%). Patients indicated a mean VAS of 8.8 (range 7-10) when attempting the procedure. After 4.5 min (range 2-10) of the first FPNS dose, the majority of patients (85.5%) indicated a VAS of 4.3 (range 2-6). 15.5% of the patients did not respond after 15 min; requiring a second dose. All these patients responded, reporting a mean VAS of 4.2 (range 4-6) after 3.0 min (range 2-5) of the second dose. None of the patients required a third dose, nor reported an AE after the administration of FPNS.CONCLUSIONS: In our knowledge, our study is the one of highest recruitment, and with the fastest response of BTCP treated with FPNS reported in advanced cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. FPNS has proven to be highly effective in reducing the intensity of procedural BTCP in a very short period of time.",Excluded
3829,"The centrosomal, putative tumor suppressor protein TACC2 is dispensable for normal development, and deficiency does not lead to cancer. TACC2 is a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein family and is associated with the centrosome-spindle apparatus during cell cycling. In vivo, the TACC2 gene is expressed in various splice forms predominantly in postmitotic tissues, including heart, muscle, kidney, and brain. Studies of human breast cancer samples and cell lines suggest a putative role of TACC2 as a tumor suppressor protein. To analyze the physiological role of TACC2, we generated mice lacking TACC2. TACC2-deficient mice are viable, develop normally, are fertile, and lack phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, TACC2 deficiency does not lead to an increased incidence of tumor development. Finally, in TACC2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, proliferation and cell cycle progression as well as centrosome numbers are comparable to those in wild-type cells. Therefore, TACC2 is not required, nonredundantly, for mouse development and normal cell proliferation and is not a tumor suppressor protein.",Excluded

1023,"Control of recollection by slow gamma dominating mid-frequency gamma in hippocampus CA1. Behavior is used to assess memory and cognitive deficits in animals like Fmr1-null mice that model Fragile X Syndrome, but behavior is a proxy for unknown neural events that define cognitive variables like recollection. We identified an electrophysiological signature of recollection in mouse dorsal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampus. During a shocked-place avoidance task, slow gamma (SG) (30-50 Hz) dominates mid-frequency gamma (MG) (70-90 Hz) oscillations 2-3 s before successful avoidance, but not failures. Wild-type (WT) but not Fmr1-null mice rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdom) decrease in WT but not in cognitively inflexible Fmr1-null mice. During SGdom, putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, WT ensembles represent distant locations near the currently correct shock zone, but Fmr1-null ensembles represent the formerly correct zone. These findings indicate that recollection occurs when CA1 SG dominates MG and that accurate recollection of inappropriate memories explains Fmr1-null cognitive inflexibility.",Excluded
918,"Effects of the memory enhancer linopirdine (Dup 996) on cerebral glucose metabolism in naive and hypoxia-exposed rats. Linopirdine [DuP 996; 3,3-bis(4-pyrindinylmethyl)-1-phenylindolin-2-one] represents a novel class of compounds which enhance depolarization-activated (but not basal) release of acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin in brain slices and improve learning and memory in rodents. The effects of linopiridine on local cerebral glucose metabolism were studied by the quantitative autoradiographic 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose method. Linopirdine administration in naive rats (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) did not significantly alter cerebral glucose metabolism in any of the regions analyzed. Since linopirdine protects against hypoxia-induced passive avoidance deficits in rats, we also examined the effects of linopirdine on cerebral metabolism after the rats were exposed to 30 min of hypoxia. Glucose metabolism was not significantly altered after hypoxic exposure, except for a small increase in some brain regions. Linopirdine administered after hypoxia decreased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus, limbic cortex, ventral hippocampal commissure, medial septum, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta, lateral habenula, cerebral cortex, cerebellar vermis and a few thalamic nuclei. Statistically significant effects of linopirdine on glucose metabolism were observed in 22 of 56 brain regions sampled. In hypoxia-exposed rats, linopirdine altered glucose metabolism in brain regions that are implicated in learning and memory and are affected in Alzheimer's disease. Several of the affected regions are associated with the cholinergic system and may play a role in the cognitive enhancing properties of linopirdine.",Excluded
3582,"Use of 2-deoxy-D[1-11C]glucose for the determination of local cerebral glucose metabolism in humans: variation within and between subjects. The deoxyglucose technique for the measurement of local cerebral glucose metabolism (LCMRgl) has been widely applied in animals utilizing 14C-deoxyglucose and in humans employing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Repeat studies in humans over a relatively brief period of time have not been possible because of the 110-min half-life of fluorine-18. With the synthesis of 11C-deoxyglucose it has now become possible to utilize this short-lived (20 min) tracer for the measurement of LCMRgl and to determine its variability within subjects over a 2-h period. The kinetic rate constants for 11C-deoxyglucose were determined for gray and white matter and found to be very similar to those for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, suggesting that these two analogues of glucose have similar affinities for the facilitated transport system and are similar substrates for hexokinase in the brain. The coefficient of variation of repeated measurements of LCMRgl in a series of six normal subjects was 5.5% to 8.7% for various gray matter structures and 9.7% and 14.0% for white matter structures. The pattern of cerebral metabolic rates is relatively constant in a given individual when the conditions of the study are unchanged. The ability to make repeat measurements in the same subject reduces the variance due to between-subject differences, allowing smaller changes in LCMRgl to be detected with confidence.",Excluded
2080,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy with helical tomotherapy for pain palliation in spine metastasis. To evaluate the pain response, local tumor control and toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with helical tomotherapy (HT) in the patients with spine metastasis. From May 2009 to June 2010, 22 patients with 31 lesions were treated by SBRT. Dose scheme were 24 Gy in 3 fractions (87.1%), 30 Gy in 5 fractions (9.7%), and 16 Gy in a single fraction (3.2%). Pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale. Analgesic consumption was recalculated into the daily oral morphine-equivalent dose (OMED). The response criteria of International Bone Metastases Consensus Group (IBMCG) was used. The median follow-up duration was 10 months (range 3-23 months). After SBRT the mean pain score decreased significantly (4.32 before SBRT, 0.71 at 3 months). However, median OMED didn't decrease until 3 months after SBRT (Median OMED; 34.5 mg before SBRT, 45 mg at 3 months). Pain response rate and pain progression-free survival rate at 3 month was 96.8 and 93.5%, respectively. Local progression-free survival rate at 3 month was 93.5%. There was no severe acute toxicity. SBRT with HT is a safe and effective treatment modality for local tumor control and pain palliation associated with spine metastasis.",Excluded
3110,"Cholinergic modulation of visuospatial responding in central thalamus. Central thalamus has extensive connections with basal ganglia and frontal cortex that are thought to play a critical role in sensory-guided goal-directed behavior. Central thalamic activity is influenced by cholinergic projections from mesopontine nuclei. To elucidate this function we trained rats to respond to lights in a reaction time (RT) task and compared effects of muscarinic (2.4, 7.3, 22 nmol scopolamine) and nicotinic (5.4, 16, 49, 98 nmol mecamylamine) antagonists with the GABA(A) agonist muscimol (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 nmol) in central thalamus. We compared this with subcutaneous (systemic) effects of mecamylamine (3.2, 9.7, 29 micromol/kg) and scopolamine (0.03, 0.09, 0.26 micromol/kg). Subcutaneous scopolamine increased omissions (failure to respond within a 3-s response window) at the highest dose tested. Subcutaneous mecamylamine increased omissions at the highest dose tested while impairing RT and per cent correct at lower doses. Intrathalamic injections of muscimol and mecamylamine decreased per cent correct at doses that did not affect omissions or RT. Intrathalamic scopolamine increased omissions and RT at doses that had little effect on per cent correct. Anatomical controls indicated that the effects of mecamylamine were localized in central thalamus and those of scopolamine were not. Drug effects did not interact with attention-demanding manipulations of stimulus duration, proximity of stimulus and response locations, or stimulus array size. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that central thalamus mediates decisional processes linking sensory stimuli with actions, downstream from systems that detect sensory signals. They also provide evidence that this function is specifically influenced by nicotinic cholinergic receptors.",Excluded
3348,"The Impact of body-only proton radiation on immune-CNS communication. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an established treatment for many hematological disorders including lymphomas and leukemias. Although the prognosis after HSCT has historically been poor, associated with high mortality rates, advances in treatment have led to increases in long-term survival and, consequently, an increased risk for neuropsychological dysfunction. Roughly 40% of all allogeneic HSCTs performed in 2006-2010 involved total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning. Previously, we reported that many TBI-induced changes in splenic phagocytic populations were mitigated by chlorisondamine (CHL), a non-selective nicotinic blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we characterized the effects of body-only proton irradiation (excluding brain) and CHL on the response to a bacterial challenge in 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were given CHL (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and irradiated (0 or 3 Gy) 60-90 min later. Ten days post-irradiation, mice were inoculated with 5e7 CFU of Escherichia coli (i.p.) and euthanized 90-120 min later. We characterized blood and splenic leukocyte population distributions (flow cytometry and hematology), cytokine levels (multiplexed cytokine analysis) and oxidative burst capacity. Radiation decreased virtually all splenic leukocyte counts while increasing oxidative burst capacity. In the blood, radiation decreased lymphocytes but increased innate subsets. Sympathetic blockade did not counter most of these radiation effects. This suggests that the disruptive effect of TBI on brain-immune communication is dependent on direct exposure to the brain.",Included
2699,"Simulated Microgravity and Low-Dose/Low-Dose-Rate Radiation Induces Oxidative Damage in the Mouse Brain. Microgravity and radiation are stressors unique to the spaceflight environment that can have an impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These stressors could potentially lead to significant health risks to astronauts, both acutely during the course of a mission or chronically, leading to long-term, post-mission decrements in quality of life. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to high concentrations of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids and low levels of antioxidant defenses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative damage in the brain cortex and hippocampus in a ground-based model for spaceflight, which includes prolonged unloading and low-dose radiation. Whole-body low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma radiation using (57)Co plates (0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) was delivered to 6 months old, mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-6/group) to simulate the radiation component. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Brains were isolated 7 days or 9 months after irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for characterization of oxidative stress markers and microvessel changes. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, was significantly elevated in the cortex and hippocampus after LDR + HLU compared to controls (P < 0.05). The combination group also had the highest level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression compared to controls (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the animals that received HLU only or combined LDR + HLU compared to control (P < 0.05). In addition, 9 months after LDR and HLU exposure, microvessel densities were the lowest in the combination group, compared to age-matched controls in the cortex (P < 0.05). Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers that may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress.",Included

2176,"Phenomenology of spatial illusory reactions under conditions of weightlessness. Sensory interaction and sensory adaptation in short- and long-lasting space flights (SF) and the dynamics of stability of adaptive shifts were studied by the phenomenology of spontaneous and visually induced illusory reactions. It was shown that perceptive impairment developed during the initial adaptation to microgravity should be considered regular reactions of sensory systems under given environmental conditions rather than special features of the individuals examined. The classification of spontaneous illusory reactions (SIR) under conditions of microgravity and the results of investigation of the vertical vection (vection is a visual illusion evoked by the optokinetic stimulation) are presented. The following previously unknown phenomena were registered for the first time: inversion of the vertical vection illusion (VVI) evoked by vertical and sinusoidal optokinetic stimulation, impairment of perception of the body schema during VVI, change in the character of VVI, and development of VVI asymmetry. During long-lasting existence under conditions of weightlessness the anomalous perceptive reactions continued to be registered episodically (the period of adaptation was replaced by that of deadaptation). A hypothesis was suggested for the possible mechanisms of the phenomena found. [Translated from Fiziologiya Cheloveka, vol. 21, no. 4, p. 50-62, July-August, 1995]",Excluded

In order to find markers to assess the functional state of the cardiovascular system before and after spaceflight (first and seventh day after landing), we analyzed the urine proteome in ten cosmonauts aged of 35 to 51 years who have completed 169 to 199-day spaceflight onboard the ISS. A special sample preparation was performed, followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the minor proteins was performed on a nano-HPLC Agilent 1100 system (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) in combination with a LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo, Germany). A total of 238 proteins was identified. According to the TIGER database, a tissue origin was established for 129 proteins. We identified 20 proteins related to the cardiovascular system. It was found that changes in cosmonauts' urine proteome comprehensively reflect the adaptive responses of cardiovascular, renal and neuroendocrine systems to long-term microgravity conditions.",Excluded
3223,"The involvement of ATF4 and S-opsin in retinal photoreceptor cell damage induced by blue LED light. PURPOSE: Blue light is a high-energy emitting light with a short wavelength in the visible light spectrum. Blue light induces photoreceptor apoptosis and causes age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by blue light-emitting diode (LED) light exposure in murine photoreceptor cells.METHODS: The murine photoreceptor cell line was incubated and exposed to blue LED light (464 nm blue LED light, 450 lx, 3 to 24 h). The expression of the factors involved in the unfolded protein response pathway was examined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analysis. The aggregation of short-wavelength opsin (S-opsin) in the murine photoreceptor cells was observed with immunostaining. The effect of S-opsin knockdown on ATF4 expression in the murine photoreceptor cell line was also investigated.RESULTS: Exposure to blue LED light increased the bip, atf4, and grp94 mRNA levels, induced the expression of ATF4 protein, and increased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Exposure to blue LED light in combination with ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and dithiothreitol) induced the aggregation of S-opsin. S-opsin mRNA knockdown prevented the induction of ATF4 expression in response to exposure to blue LED light.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the aggregation of S-opsin induced by exposure to blue LED light causes ER stress, and ATF4 activation in particular.",Excluded
