1,"[The effect of a superhigh dose of ionizing radiation on the content of catecholamine mediators in different areas of the rat brain]. In experiments with rats, it was shown that whole-body irradiation of animals with a dose of 500 Gy causes a decrease in the catecholamine mediator content of the truncus cerebri during the first minutes following irradiation. A possible mechanism of the changes observed is discussed.",Included
9,"Urethral pain among prostate cancer survivors 1 to 14 years after radiation therapy. PURPOSE: To investigate how treatment-related and non-treatment-related factors impact urethral pain among long-term prostate cancer survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden from 1993 to 2006 were approached with a study-specific postal questionnaire addressing symptoms after treatment, including urethral burning pain during urination (n=985). The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included

20,"Inhibition of radiation-induced DNA damage by jamun, Syzygium cumini, in the cultured splenocytes of mice exposed to different doses of gamma-radiation. The radioprotective property of 50 mg/kg body weight jamun (Syzygium cumini) extract was studied in the cultured splenocytes of mice exposed to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 Gy of gamma-radiation. The spleens of irradiated mice were removed aseptically and the splenocytes were extracted from the individual spleens and cultured. The micronuclei were prepared 72 hours after irradiation in binucleate splenocytes by blocking cytokinesis with cytochalasin-B. Irradiation of mice resulted in a dose-dependent elevation in the micronucleated splenocytes. The exposure of mice not only elevated splenocytes bearing one micronucleus but also cells bearing 2 and multiple (>2) micronuclei indicating induction of complex DNA damage after irradiation. Oral treatment of mice with 50 mg/kg body weight of jamun leaf extract protected against the radiation-induced micronuclei formation. Jamun extract also protected against the formation of 2 and multiple micronuclei indicating repair or inhibition of complex DNA damage. The assessment of lipid peroxidation in mice brain homogenate has indicated a concentration dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation by jamun extract. Studies in a cell free system revealed that jamun extract inhibited the formation of OH, O(2)-, DPPH, and ABTS(+) free radicals in a concentration dependent manner. Our study demonstrates that jamun extract protected mice against the radiation-induced DNA damage and inhibition of radiation-induced free radical formation may be one of the mechanisms of radioprotection.",Included
24,"Effects of spaceflight on ocular counterrolling and the spatial orientation of the vestibular system. We recorded the horizontal (yaw), vertical (pitch), and torsional (roll) eye movements of two rhesus monkeys with scleral search coils before and after the COSMOS Biosatellite 2229 Flight. The aim was to determine effects of adaptation to microgravity on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The animals flew for 11 days. The first postflight tests were 22 h and 55 h after landing, and testing extended for 11 days after reentry. There were four significant effects of spaceflight on functions related to spatial orientation: (1) Compensatory ocular counterrolling (OCR) was reduced by about 70% for static and dynamic head tilts with regard to gravity. The reduction in OCR persisted in the two animals throughout postflight testing. (2) The gain of the torsional component of the angular VOR (roll VOR) was decreased by 15% and 50% in the two animals over the same period. (3) An up-down asymmetry of nystagmus, present in the two monkeys before flight was reduced after exposure to microgravity. (4) The spatial orientation of velocity storage was shifted in the one monkey that could be tested soon after flight. Before flight, the yaw axis eigenvector of optokinetic afternystagmus was close to gravity when the animal was upright or tilted. After flight, the yaw orientation vector was shifted toward the body yaw axis. By 7 days after recovery, it had reverted to a gravitational orientation. We postulate that spaceflight causes changes in the vestibular system which reflect adaptation of spatial orientation from a gravitational to a body frame of reference. These changes are likely to play a role in the postural, locomotor, and gaze instability demonstrated on reentry after spaceflight.",Included

The ATP level in nerve ganglia of Helix pomatia was shown to decrease 15 and 30 min, and 1 and 3 h following irradiation (5.16 C/kg). The decrease was maximum in 60 min. The absorption and utilization of glucose via a pentose-phosphate route and in the Krebs cycle did not substantially change. It is concluded that the energy supply of nerve cells under study is not responsible for the decrease in the ATP level.",Included
36,"Regulation of prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> synthesis after brain irradiation. Purpose: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.

54,"Radiation arteritis: a contraindication to carotid stenting?. BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) for high-risk anatomic lesions is accepted practice. Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis.",Included
55,"Utility of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Modern Era with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance. Aims: To retrospectively analyse the impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on survival and intracranial progression in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) in the modern era of widespread magnetic resonance imaging brain screening. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with LS-SCLC treated within our network between 2009 and 2020 who responded to initial therapy were stratified by receipt of PCI and stage of disease. A propensity score match analysis was carried out for stage II-III patients. Overall and neurological survival were defined as time to death and presumed death due to uncontrolled intracranial disease, respectively. Brain metastasis-free survival and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival were defined as freedom from intracranial progression and symptomatic intracranial progression, respectively. The effect of PCI on these outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Result(s): In total, 243 (69.6%) of 349 patients received PCI. On multivariate analysis in the propensity matched stage II-III cohort, PCI was a significant predictor of improved neurological survival (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.65; P = 0.01), brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51; P < 0.01) and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55; P < 0.01), but not improved overall survival. Two-year neurological survival estimates within the propensity matched cohort were 96.8% (95% confidence interval 87.6-99.2%) with PCI and 77.2% (95% confidence interval 63.0-86.4%) without PCI and 1- and 2-year estimates of incidence of brain metastases were 3.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7%) and 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6-23.5%) in the PCI group and 31.6% (95% confidence interval 22.1-43.9%) and 40.4% (95% confidence interval 29.2-54.0%) in the no PCI group, respectively. Conclusion(s): In the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging screening, PCI was associated with reduced incidence of intracranial progression in patients with stage II-III LS-SCLC who respond to initial therapy. This, importantly, translated to a decreased risk of neurological death within our propensity matched cohort, without significant improvement in overall survival.

78,"Elevated DNA damage in a mouse model of oxidative stress: impacts of ionizing radiation and a protective dietary supplement. Transgenic growth hormone (Tg) mice express elevated free radical processes and a progeroid syndrome of accelerated ageing. We examined bone marrow cells of Tg mice and their normal (Nr) siblings for three markers of DNA damage and assessed the impact of free radical stress using ionizing radiation. We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice. Based on our data, the dietary supplement appeared to scavenge free radicals before they could cause damage. This study validates Tg mice as an exemplary model of oxidative stress and radiation hypersensitivity and documents unprecedented radioprotection by a dietary supplement comprised of ingredients available to the general public.",Included

In experiments with 112 male Wistar rats it was shown that accelerated electrons (85 Gy) caused a significant increase in activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDG) by 15.8% and lactate dehydrogenase (LDG) by 17.0%, and a decrease in activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) by 10.6 and 7.8% respectively within the sensorimotor region of the cerebral cortex immediately after irradiation. Activity of SDG and MAO decreased (by 16.4% and 7.8% respectively) in the caudate nucleus over the same period of time. An increase in the accelerated electron dose from 85 to 500 Gy did not change the direction and the rate of the radiation response of the enzymes. Exposure of rats to 60Co gamma quanta (75 Gy) increased SDG and LDG activity (by 21.4 and 17.3% respectively) within the sensorimotor cortex as late as 10 min after irradiation.

101,"Spatial learning and memory deficits induced by exposure to iron-56-particle radiation. It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.",Included

The patients and 19 healthy control subjects, matched with the patients for age and educational level, underwent extensive memory assessments. Seventeen patients (10 TLI-positive, 7 TLI-negative) were reassessed after an average of 28 months for progress of memory functions. The patient groups performed significantly worse on most memory tests compared with the normal subjects. Patients with memory complaints had lower scores for verbal memory than those without such complaints. The TLI-positive and TLI-negative groups did not differ significantly from each other in cognitive performance.

110,"Effects of 14 days of spaceflight and nine days of recovery on cell body size and succinate dehydrogenase activity of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. The cross-sectional areas and succinate dehydrogenase activities of L5 dorsal root ganglion neurons in rats were determined after 14 days of spaceflight and after nine days of recovery. The mean and distribution of the cross-sectional areas were similar to age-matched, ground-based controls for both the spaceflight and for the spaceflight plus recovery groups. The mean succinate dehydrogenase activity was significantly lower in spaceflight compared to aged-matched control rats, whereas the mean succinate dehydrogenase activity was similar in age-matched control and spaceflight plus recovery rats. The mean succinate dehydrogenase activity of neurons with cross-sectional areas between 1000 and 2000 microns2 was lower (between 7 and 10%) in both the spaceflight and the spaceflight plus recovery groups compared to the appropriate control groups. The reduction in the oxidative capacity of a subpopulation of sensory neurons having relatively large cross-sectional areas immediately following spaceflight and the sustained depression for nine days after returning to 1 g suggest that the 0 g environment induced significant alterations in proprioceptive function.",Included
117,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats. OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated.METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1.RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium.CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.",Included

An additional lesion in one of these cats displayed high signal on T2-weighted images and enhanced on T1-weighted images after IV gadolinium-DTPA. Pathologic correlation revealed that the nonenhancing T2-weighted lesions consisted of edema or demyelinated regions without inflammation while the gadolinium-enhanced lesion demonstrated necrosis with inflammatory infiltrate. Focal brain irradiation may produce noninflammatory demyelination and necrosis. These histologic entities may be potentially distinguished on MR with IV gadolinium-DTPA.",Included

132,"Increased risk of ischemic stroke after radiotherapy on the neck in patients younger than 60 years. PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in patients irradiated for head and neck tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of ischemic stroke was determined in 367 patients with head and neck tumors (162 larynx carcinomas, 114 pleomorphic adenomas, and 91 parotid carcinomas) who had been treated with local radiotherapy (RT) at an age younger than 60 years. Relative risk (RR) of ischemic stroke was determined by comparison with population rates from a stroke-incidence register, adjusted for sex and age. Other risk factors for stroke (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus [DM]) were registered. The median follow-up time after RT was 7.7 years (3,011 person-years of follow-up).RESULTS: Fourteen cases of stroke occurred (expected, 2.5; RR, 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 9.4): eight in patients with laryngeal carcinoma (expected,1.56; RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.1), four in pleomorphic adenoma patients (expected, 0.71; RR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.5), and two in parotid carcinoma patients (expected, 0.24; RR, 8.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 30.6). Five of six strokes in patients irradiated for a parotid tumor occurred at the ipsilateral side. Analysis of other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease showed hypertension and DM to cause an increase of the RR after RT. After more than 10 years' follow-up, the RR was 10.1 (95% CI, 4.4 to 20.0). The 15-year cumulative risk of stroke after RT on the neck was 12.0% (95% CI, 6.5% to 21.4%).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an increased risk of stroke after RT on the neck.

170,"MRI changes in the rat hippocampus following proton radiosurgery. PURPOSE: To define radiographic dose-response relationships for proton radiosurgery using a rat brain model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A group of 23 rats was treated with Bragg peak proton beam irradiation involving the right hippocampus. Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction technique. One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue.",Included

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases.",Included

198,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms. INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included

Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included
206,"Paralysis following stereotactic spinal irradiation in pigs suggests a tolerance constraint for single-session irradiation of the spinal nerve. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Paralysis observed during a study of vertebral bone tolerance to single-session irradiation led to further study of the dose-related incidence of motor peripheral neuropathy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a bone tolerance study, cervical spinal nerves of 15 minipigs received bilateral irradiation to levels C5-C8 distributed into three dose groups with mean maximum spinal nerve doses of 16.9 +/- 0.3 Gy (n=5), 18.7 +/- 0.5 Gy (n=5), and 24.3 +/- 0.8 Gy (n=5). Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal. Irradiated spinal nerve regions showed increased thickness and hypointensity on MR imaging.CONCLUSION: The single-session tolerance dose of the cervical spinal nerves lies between 19.0 and 24.1 Gy for this model.",Included

The response of the central nervous system to boron neutron capture irradiation, with either p-boronophenylalanine (BPA) or borocaptate sodium (BSH) as neutron capture agents, has been assessed using a rat spinal cord model. The mean latency times for the development of myelopathy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam-alone, or in combination with BPA or BSH, were 23.7 +/- 0.3, 21.8 +/- 0.4 and 19.6 +/- 0.4 weeks, respectively. The radiation-induced lesion in the spinal cord was characterised by white matter necrosis. Due to the variations in the microdistribution of different neutron capture agents in body tissues, it was considered inappropriate to define the biological effectiveness of the high LET radiation, resulting from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,alpha)<sup>7</sup>Li neutron capture reaction, relative to photon radiation, using the term 'relative biological effectiveness' (RBE). The term 'compound biological effectiveness' (CBE) factor was used as an alternative. ED<inf>50</inf> values for the various irradiation modalities were calculated from probit fitted dose effect curves. Expressed as total physical absorbed doses these values were 13.6 +/- 0.4, 30.3 +/- 2.7 and 13.8 +/- 0.5 Gy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam alone, or the thermal neutron beam in combination with BSH or BPA, respectively. The RBE of the thermal neutron beam was 1.4 +/- 0.04. The microdistribution of the two neutron capture agents played a crucial role in the determination of the overall biological effect, after thermal neutron activation. BSH, which is excluded from the CNS parenchyma by the blood brain barrier, had a low CBE factor value of 0.46 +/- 0.5. BPA, on the other hand, which crosses the blood brain barrier and distributes in the CNS parenchyma, had a higher CBE factor value of 1.33 +/- 0.16.",Included

PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included

Unfortunately, it might raise the risk of ischemic stroke, with neuroinflammation being a major pathological process. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system and have been reported for playing important roles in ischemic stroke.OBJECTIVE: Here we studied how gamma-radiation would introduce astrocytes into a detrimental state for neuroinflammation and provide new theory evidence and target for the clinical management of inflammation- related neural damage after radiation-induced ischemic stroke.METHOD: HA-1800 cells were treated with gamma-radiation and then the protein and mRNA levels of Connexin (Cx)-43 were evaluated by western and q-PCR. The culture supernatant was collected and the concentrations of the inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. MiRNA complementary to Cx-43 was designed through the online tools.RESULTS: Cx-43 is upregulated in the treatment of gamma-radiation in astrocytes and gamma-radiation introduced the detrimental function of astrocytes: cell viability was reduced while the apoptotic cells were increased. Inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin 1-beta were dramatically up-regulated by the irradiation. MiR-374a rescued irradiation induced Cx-43 up-regulation of astrocytes and eliminated detrimental function triggered by gamma-radiation.CONCLUSION: Cx-43 expression level may play an important role in the inflammation-related neural damage after irradiation-induced ischemic stroke.",Included

Participants were stratified by stage (IIIA v IIIB), histology (nonsquamous v squamous), and therapy (surgery v none) and were randomly assigned to PCI or observation. PCI was delivered to 30 Gy in 15 fractions. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS), neurocognitive function (NCF), and quality of life. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used for OS and DFS. The incidence of brain metastasis (BM) was evaluated with the logistic regression model.RESULTS: Overall, 356 patients were accrued of the targeted 1,058. The study was closed early because of slow accrual; 340 of the 356 patients were eligible. The 1-year OS (P = .86; 75.6% v 76.9% for PCI v observation) and 1-year DFS (P = .11; 56.4% v 51.2% for PCI v observation) were not significantly different. The hazard ratio for observation versus PCI was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.36). The 1-year rates of BM were significantly different (P = .004; 7.7% v 18.0% for PCI v observation).

The changes of brain water content were measured by the wet and dry weight method. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the change of expression of AQP4 protein at different periods after Gamma knife radiation. Results The brain water content and the expression of AQP4 in the target area and the peripheral zone obviously increased at 12 h after Gamma knife radiation, and achieved the peak after 2 d. It was still higher than normal after 14 d. The gray value of expression of aquaporin -4 was negatively related to brain water content (r = -0.9857, P < 0.05).

283,"Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation. Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for brain tumors but it can cause delayed progressive cognitive decline and memory deficits. Previous studies suggested that this neurocognitive dysfunction might be linked to the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, little is known regarding how to reduce the cognitive impairment caused by radiation therapy. To investigate whether environmental enrichment (EE) promotes neurogenesis and cognitive function after irradiation, irradiated gerbils were housed in EE for 2 months and evaluated by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function, and immunohistochemical analysis for neurogenesis. Our results demonstrated that even relatively low doses (5-10 Gy) of irradiation could acutely abolish precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus by more than 90%. This reduction in precursor proliferation was persistent and led to a significant decline in the granule cell population 9 months later. EE housing enhanced the number of newborn neurons and increased residual neurogenesis. EE also significantly increased the total number of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, irradiated animals after EE housing showed a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory during the water-maze test and in rotorod motor learning over a 5-day training paradigm. In conclusion, EE has a positive impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery in irradiated adult gerbils. Our data suggest that there is still a considerable amount of plasticity remaining in the hippocampal progenitor cells in adult animals after radiation injury, which can become a target of therapeutic intervention for radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction.",Included

These changes are specific to neuronal systems that are affected by aging. Since 56Fe particles make up approximately 1-2% of cosmic rays, these findings suggest that the neuronal effects of heavy particle irradiation on long-term space flights may be significant, and may even supercede subsequent mutagenic effects in their mission capabilities. It is suggested that among other methods, it may be possible to utilize nutritional modification procedures to offset the putative deleterious effects of these particles in space.",Included

The aim of present study was to clarify the remote effect of irradiation in mediastinal area on the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in selected brain regions in rats. Ionizing radiation in single dose 25 Gy induced alterations in oxidative status of blood plasma. Irradiation also decreased the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in cerebral cortex. Measurements of kinetic properties of the enzyme dependently on the concentration of energy substrate ATP or cofactor Na<sup>+</sup> indicated that the lowered enzyme activity is probably a consequence of decreased number of active molecules of the enzyme, as suggested by lowered V<sub>max</sub> values (by 13 - 14%). Immunoblot analysis revealed that this effect is connected namely to decreased presence of alpha2 and alpha3 subunits (by 25% and 30% respectively). Considering the current concepts about involvement of the malfunction of alpha2 alpha3 subunits in development of primary brain dysfunctions, it may be hypothesized that the lowered functionality of those subunits of Na,K-ATPase may represent a predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders after irradiation. The observed effect seems to be localization dependent as the enzyme in cerebellum resisted to irradiation.",Included

Astronauts on deep space missions will be required to work more autonomously than on previous missions, and thus their ability to perform executive functions could be critical to mission success. One of the most common measures of executive function in humans is the ability to perform attentional set shifting, which requires contributions from working memory, discrimination, reversal learning, attentional set shifting and attention. Rodent attentional set shifting assays require rats to form an association between the presence of the food reward and an associative cue, which is either the digging media or the scent that is placed in the bowl; by altering the combination of scent and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. In this study, we have determined the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si particles has on the ability of male retired breeder Wistar rats to perform attentional set shifting at three months postirradiation. All doses of Si resulted in a significant impairment in the ability of the rats to perform the first and most simple step of the ATSET assay, the simple discrimination (SD) task. If astronauts were to experience HZE-induced SD impairments, they would be unable to identify key factors to successfully resolve a situation. Performance in at least one other component of the ATSET test was impaired at all doses studied, however, these varied according to the dose. Compared with our previous studies using 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>48</sup>Ti particles, 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si ions impaired attentional set-shifting performance at lower doses than the heavier ions. However, when the effect of isofluences of the three HZE ions were compared, there were no significant differences in the severity of the impaired performance; there were, however, ion-specific decrements in the ability of rats to perform within the various stages of the test. This study further supports the notion that ""mission-relevant"" doses of HZE particles (<20 cGy) can impair certain aspects of attentional set-shifting performance in retired breeder rats, but there may be some ion-specific changes in the specific cognitive domains impaired.",Included

There is concern that degradation of vision as a result of space flight may compromise both mission goals and long-term quality of life after space travel.

The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy).

Inter-animal signaling from irradiated to non-irradiated organisms has been demonstrated for whole body irradiated mice and also for fish. Endpoints studied include clastogenic damage, and reproductive cell death. For fish, proteomic data has also been produced showing the induction of a protective proteome in both medaka and rainbow trout. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",Included

Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) require a better understanding of the effects of GCR on human health.

Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses. A significant dose effect was observed on recognition memory and activity levels measured 9 months postirradiation, regardless of radiation source. In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior. In summary, our findings suggest that GCR not only affects the CNS in the short term, but also has lasting damaging effects on the CNS that can cause sustained declines in behavior performance.",Included

In our previous work we established conditions to study the contribution of non-neuronal cells to the process of goldfish optic nerve regeneration. This issue has been studied successfully by adapting the use of X-irradiation to manipulate division of non-neuronal cells associated with the injured nerve. The regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells was determined subsequent to the X-ray treatment. In this work we present an analysis of the molecular events associated with regeneration and enhanced regenerative capacity which follows X-irradiation. Under normal conditions the non-neuronal cells surrounding an intact nerve released axonal growth inhibitors, the level of which was only slightly sensitive to X-irradiation. In contrast, regenerating nerves showed a marked decrease in substances having an inhibitory effect on sprouting in vitro. Moreover, their level was significantly reduced following X-irradiation which was accompanied by increased accumulation of fibrous collagen adjacent to astrocytes. The alteration in the reciprocal relationship between the axon and the surrounding non-neuronal cells was also manifested by changes in the profile of labeled proteins released by the non-neuronal cells. The results of this work, therefore, indicate the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the environment provided by the cells surrounding the regenerating fibers and thus may open a new perspective relating to the capacity of neurons to regenerate.",Included

Specific health hazards, among them radiation of cosmic origin, have caused some concern among aircrew in civil aviation in recent years. Several cohort studies in Northern countries have investigated mortality and cancer incidence among aircrew. Our goal was to study the pattern of mortality among Greek commercial airline cockpit and cabin crew. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 843 Olympic Airways cockpit crew and 1835 cabin attendants. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated based on death rates of the Greek population. Duration of employment as a proxy for occupational exposure was used to stratify the cohort. Results. For cockpit crew, the overall SMR was 0.7 (n = 65, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9). The SMR for all cancers was also significantly decreased (n = 17; SMR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Most of this reduction was due to a large deficit in lung cancer deaths (SMR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). Slight but non-significant increases were noted for brain and liver cancer. The SMR for cardiovascular death was close to unity. Among female cabin attendants the SMR for all causes was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4-1.3). The SMR for all cancers was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-1.7). Mortality from breast cancer was not increased. Among male cabin crew, SMR for all causes was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Analyses according to duration of employment showed no pattern. Conclusions. In this first-ever occupational cohort study in Greece, Greek aircrew had a low overall and cancer mortality. Due to the small number of events, the strength of our study is limited.

Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty-eight 45-day-old Wistar rats received whole brain fractionated radiation (30 Gy), whereas 48 rats received sham irradiation. Four irradiated subgroups were defined: saline, 37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg Ethyol. Sequential behavioral studies including one-way and two-way avoidance tasks were undertaken before and after radiation. Result(s): Before radiation, the performances of all groups were similar. For the one-way avoidance task, at 1, 3, and 6 months postradiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (75 or 150 mg/kg) irradiated rats (p <= 0.001). Nevertheless, lower percentage of avoidance (p <= 0.001) was only seen at 1 month postradiation in saline-irradiated rats, after comparison with their preradiation values.

Method(s): Healthy 8-week SD rats with hygiene grade were randomly divided into normal control group and model group, with 6 rats in each group. The total 30 Gy dose of radiation with 3 portions was used to irradiate the head model group rats; ELISA was performed to analysis the changes of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations in blood 2, 4 and 8 weeks after irradiation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscope were performed to observe the changes of optic structure. The use and care of the experimental animals complied with the ARVO statement. Result(s): The concentrations of ET-1 in the model group were (23.18 +/- 0.11), (27.98 +/- 0.22), (33.90 +/- 0.11), (65.25 +/- 0.38) and (43.82 +/- 0.09) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (22.65 +/- 0.14), (23.18 +/- 0.19), (23.68 +/- 0.15), (24.23 +/- 0.12) and (23.58 +/- 0.16) pg/ml. The concentrations of vWF in the model group were (63.16 +/- 2.21), (88.32 +/- 2.06), (123.38 +/- 1.36), (191.40 +/- 0.61) and (141.69 +/- 0.82) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (62.82 +/- 1.56), (63.35 +/- 2.06), (64.12 +/- 1.76), (63.52 +/- 2.02) and (63.48 +/- 1.55)pg/ml. There were significant differences of ET-1 and vWF concentrations among different groups and time points (ET-1: F<inf>group</inf>=32.160, P=0.012 ; F<inf>time</inf>=21.180, P=0.023.vWF: F<inf>group</inf>=73.110, P=0.001; F<inf>time</inf>=46.180, P=0.002). The nerve fiber bundles was swelled with disordered arrangement and vacuolization 8 weeks after irradiation. Axon swell and atrophy, axons with myelin sheath layer plate separation were obtained. The rates of axon demyelination in the normal control group and model group were (1.35 +/- 0.79)% and (14.44 +/- 2.32)%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=14.07, P<0.01). Conclusion(s): The total 30 Gy dose of radiation on the head of rats can make stable radioactive optic nerve injury model. This model making method is simple, cheap and practical, which is worth further study. Copyright Â© 2016 by the Chinese Medical Association.",Included

PURPOSE: The influence of ionizing radiation (IR) on neuronal differentiation is not well defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of IR on the differentiation of Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and the involvement of tumor protein 53 (p53) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during this process.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were exposed to (137)Cs gamma-rays at 4, 8 or 16 Gy. After incubation for 72 h with or without inhibitors of p53, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other kinases, the neuronal differentiation of irradiated Neuro-2a cells was examined through analyzing neurite outgrowth and neuronal maker expression and the activation of related signaling proteins by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. The change of neuronal marker was examined using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The irradiation of Neuro-2a cells significantly increased the neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuronal markers (neuronal nuclei [NeuN], microtubule-associated protein 2 [Map2], growth associated protein-43 [GAP-43], and Ras-related protein 13 [Rab13]). Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells.",Included

While systemic injection of the radioprotectant S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) did not block hyperthermia induced by exposure to 10 Gy of gamma radiation, central administration did attenuate it. The dephosphorylated metabolite of WR-2721, N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane (WR-1065), accentuated radiation-induced hypothermia by both routes of administration. In brain homogenates, oxygen uptake was inhibited by WR-2721 but elevated by WR-1065. These results suggest that the antagonism of radiation-induced hypothermia found only after central administration of WR-2721 is due to its direct actions and not to its dephosphorylated metabolite and that this effect may be correlated with the inhibition by WR-2721 of oxygen uptake.",Included

Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue.

The radiation effects of <sup>192</sup>Ir permanent implants into the cat brain were studied with respect to morphological changes, blood flow, brain water and electrolytes. <sup>192</sup>Ir wires (10 animals) and non-radioactive silver wires (5 control animals) were placed stereotactically into the left internal capsule. Activity of <sup>192</sup>Ir was 0.31 mCi, the accumulated dose at 5 mm distance was 3060 rad after 21 days and 4680 rad after 35 days, respectively. None of the animals presented a neurological deficit, and the EEG recording was without significant changes. Histological damage which could be attributed to the radiation was not observed. Serum proteins, however, were detected immunohistochemically in reactive astrocytes (3 x), in macrophages (2 x) and as diffuse perivascular accumulation. Brain water in the white matter near the implantation site increased from 68.6 to 73.2%, corresponding to a volume increase of about 17%. There was no change in the grey matter or the opposite hemisphere. Cerebral blood flow decreased slightly but there was no relationship with the development of edema.

552,"Locomotion and eating behavior changes in Yucatan minipigs after unilateral radio-induced ablation of the caudate nucleus. The functional roles of the Caudate nucleus (Cd) are well known. Selective Cd lesions can be found in neurological disorders. However, little is known about the dynamics of the behavioral changes during progressive Cd ablation. Current stereotactic radiosurgery technologies allow the progressive ablation of a brain region with limited adverse effects in surrounding normal tissues. This could be of high interest for the study of the modified behavioral functions in relation with the degree of impairment of the brain structures. Using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy combined with synchrotron microbeam radiation, we investigated, during one year after irradiation, the effects of unilateral radio-ablation of the right Cd on the behavior of Yucatan minipigs. The right Cd was irradiated to a minimal dose of 35.5 Gy delivered in three fractions. MRI-based morphological brain integrity and behavioral functions, i.e. locomotion, motivation/hedonism were assessed. We detected a progressive radio-necrosis leading to a quasi-total ablation one year after irradiation, with an additional alteration of surrounding areas. Transitory changes in the motivation/hedonism were firstly detected, then on locomotion, suggesting the influence of different compensatory mechanisms depending on the functions related to Cd and possibly some surrounding areas. We concluded that early behavioral changes related to eating functions are relevant markers for the early detection of ongoing lesions occurring in Cd-related neurological disorders.",Included

Design(s): In the present study, thirty-two adult male Dawley rats, 8-12 weeks of age and weighing 275+/-35 grams were randomly divided into four groups each group compressed eight animals: group 1: control (C), group 2: irradiated rats (RT), group 3: irradiated rats with oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 days (RT+RJ50), group 4: oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 day (RJ50). Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation delivered to total cranium. Royal jelly was administered before and after irradiation per day for 7 days. At the seventh day of study, when rats were under ketamine anesthesia samples of brain tissues were taken and biochemical and microscopic examination after sacrification.

Brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high utilization of oxygen and rather poorly developed antioxidative defense mechanism. Free radicals formation is greatly augmented during ionizing radiation exposure, which causes damage in cerebellum responsible for locomotor activity. Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) having high content of beta-carotene (about 15 mg/100g), ascorbic acid, Vitamin C and folate, may prove efficient antioxidants. To evaluate its antioxidative efficacy, healthy Swiss albino mice from an inbred colony were selected and divided into three groups having equal number of male and female in each group. All of these animals were initially trained in Hebb William's Maze, model D(1). After initial training of 10 days, two groups were supplemented with methanolic extract of A. paniculatus (Linn.) at a dose of 600 and 800 mg/kg bw per day, respectively for 15 days. One group without any treatment served as normal. It has been observed that mice, supplemented with extract took lesser time to reach goal than normal (without any treatment). Furthermore after supplementation of Amaranthus, followed by exposure to 9 Gy of gamma radiation by 60Co beam therapy unit, the survived mice took lesser time to reach to their goals than those without plant extract. Control mice (not supplemented with AE extract) showed continuous decline in their learning performance. Mice of Control group died within 12 days after exposure. Irradiated males try to recover from 10th day onwards but they died up to day 12. But in Experimental mice (AE treated), after initial decline in learning ability after exposure, recovery was noticed and not only this 70% of them survived beyond the observation period. Besides male mice showed faster learning ability as compared to females in all groups. After irradiation too, males took lesser time to reach to goals. Learning in all the groups before exposure has been much faster in between 9 and 15 days. After radiation, however it was followed by a sudden spurt and delayed learning response up to 12 days. Recovery was greater in males than females in treated groups. Recovery was greater in males of 600 mg/kg bw per day than other groups. Learning has been almost at the same level from 14th day onward, which indicates that both the dose levels have been found equally effective.",Included

Acute X irradiation of the metacerebral giant neurons of Helix pomatia above 1000 R or 3.4 kR/min (dose or dose rate threshold) leads to a significant reduction of the membrane potential. After blocking the afferent excitatory synapses the radiation depolarizations are strongly decreased but not completely suppressed. Long time irradiation at high dose rates and after the blocking of afferent synapses produced a depolarization in 2 phases: an immediate quick depolarization of about 10 mV is followed by a much slower decrease of the membrane potential. Substitution of extracellular sodium by tris ions suppresses the quick depolarization phase. The input resistance of the cell shows a transient increase at the begin of irradiation followed by a substantial decrease. These results are discussed in view of the possible mechanisms of radiation induced permeability changes in excitable membranes.,Included

BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiotherapy decreases the risk for local recurrence and improves overall survival in women with breast cancer. We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001). Daily life and analgesic use did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Ten to 17 years after postoperative radiotherapy 1 in 12 women had weekly pain that could be attributed to radiotherapy. The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women.",Included
608,"Dose-responses from multi-model inference for the non-cancer disease mortality of atomic bomb survivors. The non-cancer mortality data for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular diseases from Report 13 on the atomic bomb survivors published by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation were analysed to investigate the dose-response for the influence of radiation on these detrimental health effects. Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data. Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that all fitted the data about equally well. Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice. This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties. For CVD, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses. The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose. For mortalities related to cardiovascular diseases, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals. The MMI approach described here resolves a dilemma in practical radiation protection when one is forced to select between models with profoundly different dose-responses for risk estimates.",Included

The patients were divided into three groups, according to the time following completion of RT. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) volume were determined. The DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and the GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Compared with the pre-RT group, the mean FA values in the left parietal lobe white matter (WM) and right cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05). In addition, the mean FA values in the right parietal lobe WM decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05), compared with the pre-RT group. The FA level in the right temporal lobe remained significantly decreased, compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. Furthermore, compared with pre-RT group, the GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobe, right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and left cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05), and in the bilateral temporal lobe, parietal lobe, right frontal lobe and left cerebellum, the GM volume decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05). The GM volume in the right temporal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe and bilateral cerebellum remained significantly decreased compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT.

Four days later, when both the cellular and the humoral immune responses were impaired, they received an i.v. infusion of either phenobarbital (0.8 mg/min), ethanol (16.3 mg/min), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 0.618 mg/min), or theophylline (as aminophylline; 2 mg/min). The infusion was stopped at the onset of the pharmacologic end point--loss of righting reflex for the depressant agents or maximal seizures for the stimulant drugs--and the concentrations of the neuroactive drugs at that point were determined. In the ethanol experiment, blood samples were also taken upon awakening. The radiation-induced immunosuppression significantly decreased the CNS sensitivity to the depressant action of both phenobarbital and ethanol as indicated by the higher CSF phenobarbital concentrations required to induce sleep in the irradiated rats versus controls (156 +/- 4 vs 133 +/- 5 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.05), and the higher serum ethanol concentrations at the onset and offset of sleep in the immunosuppressed group versus control values (4.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.68 +/- 0.01 vs 3.79 +/- 0.17 and 1.32 +/- 0.9 mg/mL, respectively; P < 0.04).

For 24 h after total gamma-radiation of mature Wistar male rats (180-210 g) in the dose of 150 Gy, ultrastructural rearrangements of the cerebral sensomotor cortex are presented as small destructive changes in neurons, neuroglia and vascular endothelium. Total combination of the changes in ultrastructure of the blood capillaries and perivascular astrocytes makes it possible to suppose that permeability of the microvascular bed wall is increased. At this period, together with the destructive changes there are evidently certain compensatory-restorative processes, developing in the cerebral tissue. It is possible to suppose that already during the first hours after the radiation the ultrastructural changes of neurons are resulted not only from the direct effect of radiation, but from certain influences of the radiation damage of neuroglia and microvessels.",Included

OBJECTIVE: The study was focused on evaluation of peculiarities of the clinical manifestations of type II diabetesmellitus (TIIDM) in the Chornobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident clean-up workers (ACUW).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ChNPP ACUW of 1986-1987 period (n = 449, males) and 158 males not exposed to ion-izing radiation (the control group, CG) were involved in the study in 2013-2018. Diagnosis of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) was established in accordance with diagnostic standards adopted inUkraine. All study subjects had no signs of CVD, and neither of endocrine disease nor of metabolic disorders beforethe accident.RESULTS: Clinical course of the TIIDM, depending on the disease severity, onset of angiopathy and polyneuropathy,prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure were surveyed and analyzed. Concomitant TIIDM was associated witha higher incidence of angina pectoris and heart failure. According to the Kaplan-Meier method of survival estimatingthe accumulation of new TIIDM cases occurred faster in the ACUW compared with individuals in the CG, however withno statistical significance in subjects aged up to 60 years old (log-rank test chi2 = 4.89, p = 0.027). Mean age of theACUW having comorbid CVD and DM was (54.6 +/- 9.7) years, whilst in the CG it was (59.9 +/- 10.7) years (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: The DM course in the ACUW was not significantly different from non-irradiated control both in sever-ity and such complications as angiopathy of retina and lower extremities, as well as manifestations of lower extrem-ity polyneuropathy. Clinical manifestations of CVD in the form of angina pectoris and heart failure were identical inthe ACUW and control group of patients having a comorbid TIIDM. The latter was a factor exacerbating the CVDcourse and leading to a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure both in the ACUW and in non-irritat-ed individuals. Accumulation of the new DM cases occurred more rapidly in ACUW vs. non-irradiated control, so theywere in average 5 years younger at the time of TIIDM manifestation than the control subjects.",Included

Plasmodium gallinaceum-infected blood which received up to 24 krad during exposure to gamma-rays from a cobalt-60 source produced infections of normal course and duration when injected into chickens. The prepatent period advanced with increasing exposure of infected blood to radiation, suggesting some degree of attenuation. At 26, 28 and 30 krad, the infections were transient and the parasites were morphologically abnormal. It is thought that the amount of radiation required to render the parasites non-viable is about 45 krad for an inoculum of 10(6) parasites. There is evidence that exoerythrocytic stages may be more susceptible to gamma-rays than are blood parasites. Chickens were inoculated three times, over a period of four weeks, with vaccines prepared from gamma-irradiated infected blood and brain tissue. Half the birds which had been inoculated with attenuated parasitized blood exhibited mild infections during vaccination, and they were the only birds to show at challenge immunity to both homologous blood and exoerythrocytic parasites.",Included

Also, lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) and metallothionein (MT) levels were measured in liver, kidney and testis. Rats were exposed to total dose of 0.03Gy gamma-rays along 12h at a low dose rate (2.5mGy/h). The results obtained manifested elevation in all essential metals studied in liver. All organs showed elevated Ca levels except that of brain with non-significant change in intestine. Decrease in Fe levels were observed in kidney, testis, intestine, heart and brain tissues with insignificant change in spleen tissue. Elevation in MDA in liver and kidney tissues was recorded and an inhibition in MT in liver, kidney and testis tissues was demonstrated.

Ninety-six 45-day-old, 70 4-month-old, and 78 18-month-old male rats were divided in two equal groups: (i) irradiated and (ii) control.

Sequential behavioral studies including one and two-way avoidance tests were undertaken before and after the 7 months following radiation. The results suggest that radiation induced progressive and irreversible memory dysfunction in elderly (18-month-old) rats, but this effect was partial or almost reversible in the 4-month-old and 45-day-old rats, respectively. In return, the learning dysfunction was age non-dependent despite the fact that is occurs more rapidly in the young (45 days, 4 months) rats.",Included

The shift was found to exert a significant influence on the functional state of the nervous system promoting the development or aggravation of autonomous dysfunction. In some cases, it causes an elevation of blood pressure to the level of risk for cerebral vascular disease. The effect of shift on the cerebral bioelectric activity of NPS operators manifests itself in the decrease of percentage of unchanged EEG, increase of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads. These changes may be caused by weariness as well as the effects of adverse factors the operators were exposed to at the NPS.

Irradiation had the effect of advancing the appearance of amyloidosis to the 7-12 months group but did not intensify the amyloidotic process. IgG binding to the nucleus or cytoplasm of neurons was rare, and, despite the fact that IgM and IgA binding to these structures was present in about one-third of the animals, there was neither an aging nor an irradiation effect.

Whether this is due to their endocrine consequences (hypopituitarism), their underlying hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or both is still under debate. The aim of this trial was to measure quality of life (QoL) in long-term cancer survivors who have received a radiation dose to the basal part of the brain and the pituitary.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=101) treated for oropharyngeal or epipharyngeal cancer with radiotherapy followed free of cancer for a period of 4 to10 years were identified. Fifteen patients (median age 56 years) with no concomitant illness and no hypopituitarism after careful endocrine evaluation were included in a case-control study with matched healthy controls. Doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary region were calculated. QoL was assessed using the Symptom check list (SCL)-90, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and Psychological Well Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Level of physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire.RESULTS: The median accumulated dose was 1.9 Gy (1.5-2.2 Gy) to the hypothalamus and 2.4 Gy (1.8-3.3 Gy) to the pituitary gland in patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 6.0-9.3 Gy and 33.5-46.1 Gy, respectively in patients with epipharyngeal cancer (n=2).

794,"Using superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics to manipulate the redox environment of neural precursor cells. Past work has shown that neural precursor cells are predisposed to redox sensitive changes, and that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the acute and persistent changes that occur within the irradiated CNS. Irradiation leads to a marked rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that correlates with oxidative endpoints in vivo and reductions in neurogenesis. To better understand the impact of oxidative stress on neural precursor cells, and to determine if radiation-induced oxidative damage and precursor cell loss after irradiation could be reduced, a series of antioxidant compounds (EUK-134, EUK-163, EUK-172, EUK-189) were tested, three of which possess both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and one (EUK-163) whose only significant activity is SOD. Our results show that these SOD/catalase mimetics apparently increase the oxidation of a ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye, particularly after short (12 h) treatments, but that longer treatments (24 h) decrease oxidation attributable to radiation-induced ROS. Similarly, other studies found that cells incubated with CuZnSOD showed some increase in intracellular ROS levels. Subsequent data suggested that the dye-oxidising capabilities of the EUK compounds were linked to differences in their catalase activity and, most likely, their ability to catalyse peroxidative pathways. In unirradiated mice, the EUK-134 analogue induced some decrease of proliferating precursor cells and immature neurons 48 h after radiation, an effect that may be attributable to cytotoxicity and/or inhibition of precursor proliferation. In irradiated mice, a single injection of EUK-134 was not found to be an effective radioprotector at acute times (48 h). The present results support continued development of our in vitro model as a tool for predicting certain in vivo responses, and suggest that in some biological systems the capability to scavenge superoxide but produce excess H(2)O(2), as is known for CuZnSOD, may be potentially deleterious. Our results also show that the ability of catalase mimetics, like true catalases, to catalyse peroxidase reactions can complicate the interpretation of data obtained with certain fluorescent ROS-indicator dyes.",Included

If the cells are exposed to a neutron dose followed by X-rays the resulting survival is higher than would be obtained if the primary dose had been an iso-effective X-ray dose. However, it is lower than would be expected if the two radiations acted independently. The results imply that there is interaction between the damage caused by X-rays and fast neurons.

The distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied with intracellular recordings in X-irradiated and normal rats. 2. In the treated rats, multiple steps in the post-synaptic potential were elicited in 57% of the Purkinje cells by graded stimulation of the climbing fibres, the response was all-or-none in character in the other cells and in all Purkinje cells recorded in normal animals. In the neurones exhibiting the former type of response, no collision was seen along the afferent fibres during interaction experiments between just-threshold juxtafastigial and maximal olivary stimulations, whereas a collision always occurred when all-or-none responses were recorded. 3. These results show that in X-irradiated rats, the majority of Purkinje cells have a multiple innervation by two to four climbing fibres, instead of the one-to-one relationship seen normally. 4. Input resistances and total electrotonic lengths of Purkinje cells were measured in normal and treated rats. Mean values for these two parameters were higher than normal in multiply innervated cells. 5. Mean time course and mean current for reversal of the post-synaptic potential elicited in Purkinje cells by stimulation of the climbing fibres were nearly the same in mono- and in multiply innervated neurones. In multiply innervated cells, time courses and currents for reversal were independent of the size of the response or varied slightly with it, suggesting that the climbing fibres involved innervated territories whose electrotonic distance from the recording site were either the same or slightly different. 6. Interactions between two all-or-none steps of the graded post-synaptic potential evoked in multiply innervated cells by juxtafastigial and olivary stimulations revealed either a very weak or a very marked shunting effect between synapses of the two climbing fibres involved. 7. These results indicate that the over-all distribution of climbing fibre synapses on multiply innervated Purkinje cells is not grossly abnormal and that two fibres contacting a given cell can be either intermingled on the same dendrites, or segregated on distinct dendritic branches. 8. In general, the present study does not suggest the existence of a strong competition among climbing fibres innervating each Purkinje cell during development at least when granule cells are absent.",Included

Study of the patterns of the postradiation death of differentiating and proliferating cells in the subependymal zone of the rat brain. [Russian]. The post-irradiation cell kinetics was studied in vivo autoradiographically with 3H-thymidine, injected 60-80 minutes before the whole body X-irradiation of rats in doses of 50, 150 or 300 R. The wavy character of death was shown in the proliferating and differentiating rat's brain subependymal cells. After cell irradiation in G2- and S-phases four peaks of labeled mitotic cells with pycnotic nuclei (""mitotic death"") were recorded. The application of the double labelling technique with 3H- and 14C-thymidine showed that the lethally damaged cells irradiated in G1-phase had lost their ability to synthesize DNA. The nuclei of these cells became pycnotic later than 4 hours after irradiation, as follows indirectly from data recorded by Shmakova et al. (1972). The conformity in the time and alternation of the death peak appearance of differentiating cells and of the appearance of the death peaks and mitoses in proliferating cells enabled us to assume the persistence of the cycle (""short cycle"") in differentiating cells with the rhythm similar to that in the mitotic cycle. All the cells of the system were blocked during one hour, independently of the dose of irradiation, in one of six points of the cycle (mitotic cycle, short cycle). All these data suggest that the death of the differentiating cells and of cells which at the time of irradiation were in G1-phase could be timed to the final phase of the cycle (short cycle, mitotic cycle), coinciding in time with M-phase of the mitotic cycle.",Included

The skin of 50 pigs has been irradiated with negative pi mesons and with X rays in order to determine the RBE for early epidermal and later dermal damage. Late fibrosis was not studied. Four, 7, 9 and 10 fractions were used. An estimate of the RBE was made from the reactions on each pig for both early and late damage so that interanimal variability would be avoided. The data were also averaged to obtain mean dose response curves. There was no tendency for higher RBE's for late than for early skin damage. These pig studies have demonstrated an RBE of about 1.5 for early epidermal reactions and a slightly lower RBE (approximately 1.4) for later dermal damage in the same animals. This indicates that at doses of about 2.0 to 3.5 Gy pions, the medium wave skin damage is unlikely to be more severe than would be predicted from the early skin reactions and the accumulated clinical experience with X rays. However, if the trend to a steeper slope for the RBE versus dose per fraction for late injury is correct, as indicated by other published studies a relative increase in the late injury might be expected if much lower doses per fraction are used.

Brain injury was quantified using computed tomography (CT), with serial studies obtained monthly up to 1 year following irradiation. Quantitative endpoints included low density volume and contrast enhancement. Doses above 14.3 Gy resulted in high lethality 5-8 months following irradiation, and an LD50 of 14.9 Gy was calculated. At these lethal doses, low density volume representing edema, demyelination, and necrosis had a similar response with an ED50 of 14.6 Gy. Radiation-induced decreases in white matter density appeared 5-6 months after sublethal doses (less than or equal to 14.3 Gy) and the volume of tissue characterized by this low density increased with time and dose. This sublethal low density change had an ED50 of 12.8 Gy, and may reflect a loss or generalized atrophy of glial cells and/or myelin. These results show that: (a) the dose response curves obtained after hemibrain x-irradiation are extremely steep; and (b) at least two processes may be involved in the development of late radiation damage, one that is rapid upon onset (a ""delayed acute"" reaction) and the other which is a slower and more degenerative process.",Included

Deep space travel presents a number of measurable risks including exposure to a spectrum of radiations of varying qualities, termed galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that are capable of penetrating the spacecraft, traversing through the body and impacting brain function. Using rodents, studies have reported that exposure to simulated GCR leads to cognitive impairments associated with changes in hippocampus function that can persist as long as one-year post exposure with no sign of recovery. Whether memory can be updated to incorporate new information in mice exposed to GCR is unknown. Further, mechanisms underlying long lasting impairments in cognitive function as a result of GCR exposure have yet to be defined. Here, we examined whether whole body exposure to simulated GCR using 6 ions and doses of 5 or 30 cGy interfered with the ability to update an existing memory or impact hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism believed to underlie memory processes, by examining long term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle aged male mice 3.5-5 months after radiation exposure. Using a modified version of the hippocampus-dependent object location memory task developed by our lab termed ""Objects in Updated Locations"" (OUL) task we find that GCR exposure impaired hippocampus-dependent memory updating and hippocampal LTP 3.5-5 months after exposure. Further, we find that impairments in LTP are reversed through one-time systemic subcutaneous injection of the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP 966 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that long lasting impairments in cognitive function may be mediated at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms.",Included

Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression.

The SI ratio between DCN and brain stem was evaluated on T1-weigthed MRI at baseline and 1 week after the last administration. Subsequently, the brain was dissected for gadolinium quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was done with the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: An increased but similar DCN/brain stem SI ratio was found for all three groups (p = 0.14). The gadolinium tissue concentrations (median, nmol/g) were 6.7 (tumor), 6.3 (radiotherapy), and 6.8 (control) in the cerebellum (p = 0.64) and 17.8/14.6 (tumor), 20.0/18.9 (radiotherapy), and 17.8/15.9 (control) for the primary tumor (p = 0.98) and the contralateral hemisphere (p = 0.41) of the cerebrum, respectively.CONCLUSION: An experimental brain tumor treated by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone did not alter DCN signal hyperintensity and gadolinium concentration in the rat brain 1 week after repeated administration of gadopentetate. This suggests that a local BBB disruption does not affect the amount of retained gadolinium in the brain.",Included

1050,"Short and long-term evaluation of the impact of proton minibeam radiation therapy on motor, emotional and cognitive functions. Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used methods for cancer treatment. Despite remarkable advancements in RT techniquesthe treatment of radioresistant tumours (i.e. high-grade gliomas) is not yet satisfactory. Finding novel approaches less damaging for normal tissues is of utmost importance. This would make it possible to increase the dose applied to tumours, resulting in an improvement in the cure rate. Along this line, proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel strategy that allows the spatial modulation of the dose, leading to minimal damage to brain structures compared to a high dose (25 Gy in one fraction) of standard proton therapy (PT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pMBRT also preserves important cerebral functions. Comprehensive longitudinal behavioural studies were performed in irradiated (peak dose of 57 Gy in one fraction) and control rats to evaluate the impact of pMBRT on motor function (motor coordination, muscular tonus, and locomotor activity), emotional function (anxiety, fear, motivation, and impulsivity), and cognitive function (learning, memory, temporal processing, and decision making). The evaluations, which were conducted over a period of 10 months, showed no significant motor or emotional dysfunction in pMBRT-irradiated rats compared with control animals. Concerning cognitive functions, similar performance was observed between the groups, although some slight learning delays might be present in some of the tests in the long term after irradiation. This study shows the minimal impact of pMBRT on the normal brain at the functional level.",Included

Exposure of rats to 1-15 Gy gamma radiation (<sup>60</sup>Co) induced hyperthermia, whereas 20-200 Gy induced hypothermia. Exposure either to the head or the whole body to 10 Gy induced hyperthermia, while body-only exposure produced hypothermia. This observation indicates that radiation-induced fever is a result of a direct effect on the brain. The hyperthermia due to 10 Gy was significantly attenuated by the pre- or post-treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Hyperthermia was also altered by the central administration of a mu-receptor antagonist naloxone but only at low doses of radiation. These findings suggest that radiation-induced hyperthermia may be mediated through the synthesis and release of prostaglandins in the brain and to a lesser extent to the release of endogenous opioid peptides. The release of histamine acting on H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors may be involved in radiation-induced hypothermia, since both the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, mepyramine, and H<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist, cimetidine, antagonized the hypothermia. The results of these studies suggest that the release of neurohumoral substances induced by exposure to ionizing radiation is dose dependent and has different consequences on physiological processes such as the regulation of body temperature. Furthermore, the antagonism of radiation-induced hyperthermia by indomethacin may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of fever resulting from accidental irradiations.",Included

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for incident functional disability among long-term evacuees of Iitate village after Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster (GEJE). We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, both the group with low-participation in the exercise program and the group with high-participation in the exercise program had a significantly lower rate of incident functional disability compared to those who did not participate at all (HR = 0.27, CI: 0.16-0.46; HR = 0.30, CI: 0.12-0.74, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-disaster BCL domains were useful to identify individuals at risk of functional disability after a major socio-technical disaster.

1135,"Relationship between dose and the latent period for radiation myelopathy in rats. A 1-cm segment of rat cervical spinal cord was irradiated (16-150 Gy) and the animals were followed for 16 months to determine the dose-response relationship for the latent period for radiation myelopathy. The latent period was found to be dependent on dose in the ED0 to ED100 dose range, independent of dose in the range ED100 to 1.5 times the ED100 dose and dependent on dose for doses more than 1.5 times the ED100 dose. Histologically, some vascular injury and demyelinization were observed in the irradiated cord segment of all paretic animals. In the first dose-dependent region there was a bimodal distribution of latent periods, suggesting two mechanisms for paralysis in this dose region. A hypothesis based on glial and vascular injury is presented which explains the triphasic dose-response relationship for the latent period. The 95% confidence limits for the dose location of both of the dose-dependent regions were less than 10% of the administered dose. Therefore, if used correctly, the latent period as an end point should be able to be used to detect dose-modifying parameters (i.e. RBE and OER) that are greater than 20%.",Included

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT)-induced neurocognitive disability may be mediated by brain tissue damage. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of standard RT on normal brain tissue via in vivo neuroimaging in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 146 newly diagnosed NPC patients who were treated with standard RT were longitudinally followed up at multiple time points during the first year post-RT, with 19 comparable healthy controls followed up in parallel serving as normal age-related benchmarks. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate longitudinal brain white matter tract changes in NPC patients. The relationships between RT-related white matter changes, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment were also assessed.RESULTS: Bilateral cingulate angular bundle (CAB) fibers had progressive diffusion reduction [radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity] over time (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in NPC patients during the first year after RT. RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with longitudinal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus (P = 0.033). Additionally, RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with progressive cognitive impairment in NPC patients post-RT (P = 0.048).CONCLUSION: We present evidence of progressive RT-associated changes in the bilateral CAB in NPC patients, which may underlie RT-related cognitive impairment. These findings illustrate that the use of white matter tract alterations as potential biomarkers to detect RT-related brain injury in NPC patients may be useful for better understanding the pathogenesis of RT-induced cognitive decline.",Included

PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to quantitatively define proliferative and infiltrative cell responses after focal 125I irradiation of normal brain, and to determine the effects of an intravenous infusion of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) on those responses.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult beagle dogs were irradiated using high activity 125I sources. Saline (control) or DFMO (150 mg/kg/day) was infused for 18 days starting 2 days before irradiation. At varying times up to 8 weeks after irradiation, brain tissues were collected and the cell responses in and around the focal lesion were quantified. Immunohistochemical stains were used to label astrocytes (GFAP), vascular endothelial cells (Factor VIII), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; MAC 387) and cells synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (BrdU). Cellular responses were quantified using a histomorphometric analysis.RESULTS: After radiation alone, cellular events included a substantial acute inflammatory response followed by increased BrdU labeling and progressive increases in numbers of capillaries and astrocytes. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine treatment significantly affected the measured cell responses. As in controls, an early inflammatory response was measured, but after 2 weeks there were more PMNs/unit area than in controls. The onset of measurable BrdU labeling was delayed in DFMO-treated animals, and the magnitude of labeling was significantly reduced. Increases in astrocyte and vessel numbers/mm2 were observed after a 2-week delay. At the site of implant, astrocytes from DFMO-treated dogs were significantly smaller than those from controls.CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial cell proliferation and infiltration in response to interstitial irradiation of normal brain, and these responses are significantly altered by DFMO treatment. Although the precise mechanisms by which DFMO exerts its effects in this model are not known, the results from this study suggest that modification of radiation injury may be possible by manipulating the response of normal cells to injury.",Included

Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months.

The data obtained showed that selenous yeast supplementation increased Se levels in rat tissues (highest increases in hypothalamus, 161%; hind brain, 126%; spleen, 110%; and adrenal gland, 105%). Ionizing radiation induced significant changes in Se content and distribution (decrease in liver, blood, hair, femoral muscle, spleen, and hypothalamus; increase in kidney, testes, adrenal glands, and brain of placebo group).

1222,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus. The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included

PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.",Included
1235,"Oxidative stress and adult neurogenesis-Effects of radiation and superoxide dismutase deficiency. Hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and in spatial navigation. Production of new neurons that are functionally integrated into the hippocampal neuronal network is important for the maintenance of functional plasticity. In adults, production of new neurons in the hippocampus takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. Neural progenitor/stem cells go through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation. This process is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress, and perturbation in the redox balance in the neurogenic microenvironment can lead to reduced neurogenesis. Cranial irradiation is an effective treatment for primary and secondary brain tumors. However, even low doses of irradiation can lead to persistent elevation of oxidative stress and sustained suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes for the removal of superoxide radicals in different subcellular compartments. To identify the subcellular location where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated after cranial irradiation, different SOD deficient mice have been used to determine the effects of irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. The study results suggest that, regardless of the subcellular location, SOD deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the production of new neurons in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus. In exchange, the generation of new glial cells was significantly increased. The SOD deficient condition, however, altered the tissue response to irradiation, and SOD deficient mice were able to maintain a similar level of neurogenesis after irradiation while wild type mice showed a significant reduction in the production of new neurons.

Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the early neurovascular alterations of the retina in radiation encephalopathy (RE) patients with normal-ranged visual acuity after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): Fifty-five RE patients and 54 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) of the included eye should not be more than 0. The vessel density and thickness of different locations in the retina were acquired automatically using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The data were then compared between the RE patients and the controls. The location included the whole retina, the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)/the ganglion cell complex (GCC), the deep vascular plexus (DVP), and the choroid in the macular area, as well as the inside disc and peripapillary area in the optic nerve head (ONH). The risk factors in OCTA retinal impairments were analyzed using a backward multiple linear regression. The relationships between mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in the visual field (VF) and the OCTA parameters were also analyzed in RE patients. Result(s): The vessel density of the GCC was significantly reduced in RE patients compared with controls (p = 0.018), and the reductions were mainly shown in the parafoveal (p = 0.049) and perifoveal fields (p = 0.006). The thickness of the GCC was correspondingly reduced (whole image GCC mean thickness: p = 0.044; parafoveal thickness: p = 0.038; perifoveal thickness: p = 0.038).

The vessel density of the GCC also had a significant negative correlation with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (beta = -32.18, p = 0.006). In the VF, MD had a significant positive correlation with the vessel density inside disc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.241, beta = 0.304, p = 0.045), whereas PSD showed a significant negative correlation with the vessel density inside disc and the average GCC thickness, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437; vessel density inside disc, beta = -0.358, p = 0.004; average GCC thickness, beta = -0.510, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): With the aid of OCTA, we found that neurovascular alterations of the retina may exist in RE patients with normal-ranged visual acuity.

DTI was performed before the irradiation and 1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 24weeks after injury to obtain the cross-sectional area, and the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values.RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the injured optic nerve exhibited significant atrophy 24weeks after SRS. FA declined 1week after injury; this value then increased slightly but remained lower than before injury (P<0.05). AD began to decline in the 2weeks after injury and gradually disappeared (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: SRS with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve) on the unilateral intraorbital optic nerve can induce RION. DTI can detect RION at an early stage. FA and AD are useful indicators for RION diagnosis. In the early stage, the primary site of RION may be the vascular endothelium.",Included

BACKGROUND: Exposure of the brain to ionizing radiation might promote the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).OBJECTIVE: Analysis of AD death rates versus radon background radiation and total background radiation in U.S. states.METHODS: Total background, radon background, cosmic and terrestrial background radiation measurements are from Assessment of Variations in Radiation Exposure in the United States and Report No. 160 - Ionizing Radiation Exposure of the Population of the United States. 2013 AD death rates by U.S. state are from the Alzheimer's Association.RESULTS: Radon background ionizing radiation was significantly correlated with AD death rate in 50 states and the District of Columbia (r = 0.467, p = 0.001). Total background ionizing radiation was also significantly correlated with AD death rate in 50 states and the District of Columbia (r = 0.452, p = 0.001). Multivariate linear regression weighted by state population demonstrated that AD death rate was significantly correlated with radon background (beta= 0.169, p < 0.001), age (beta= 0.231, p < 0.001), hypertension (beta= 0.155, p < 0.001), and diabetes (beta= 0.353, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Our findings, like other studies, suggest that ionizing radiation is a risk factor for AD. Intranasal inhalation of radon gas could subject the rhinencephalon and hippocampus to damaging radiation that initiates AD. The damage would accumulate over time, causing age to be a powerful risk factor.",Included

Rats of one or ten days of age were irradiated with low doses of gamma radiation, and synthesis of DNA was examined by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine in the cerebellum and the rest of the brain in vivo. DNA synthesis was depressed in both parts of the brain but the effects were larger in cerebellum. A minimum was found about 10 hours after irradiation in the older rats and later (18 h) in the younger ones. The dose response, in 10-day-old rats, was biphasic and showed that cerebellum was more affected. Autoradiographs showed that fewer cells entered the cycle and those synthesizing showed a depressed rate of synthesis. These findings are discussed in relation to induction of cell death.",Included
1266,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation. Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included

Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of complete resection and postoperative radiotherapy in spinal cord ependymomas. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective study over 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymomas between July 1985 and April 2001. Among them, 13 patients had ependymomas, 6 had myxopapillary ependymomas, and 1 had anaplastic ependymoma. All patients received radical surgery for tumor removal with 13 patients achieving complete resection and 7 incomplete resection due to technical difficulty. Among those with incomplete resection, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed and only one patient with anaplastic ependymoma received surgery alone. The total tumor dose ranged from 50 to 60 Gy. Result(s): Among the 20 patients, 19 patients were alive and showed local control. The median survival time of all patients was 109 months, with 104 months in the complete resection alone group and 135 months in the incomplete resection with postoperative radiotherapy group. One patient with anaplastic ependymoma and no postoperative radiotherapy developed leptomeningeal seeding 9 months after surgery. Salvage therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy maintained normal neurological functions. The patient expired 34 months from the initial diagnosis due to progression of leptomeningeal seeding. Conclusion(s): Complete resection alone in spinal cord ependymoma can achieve excellent local control and survival. Patients should receive complete resection if technically possible. Postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended for complete resection. For incomplete resection, postoperative local radiotherapy is recommended and it can also achieve excellent local control and survival. Local radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy is effective and safe. Salvage radiotherapy improves quality of life for local recurrence or leptomeningeal seeding patients. Â© Springer 2005.",Included
1295,"Effect of Gamma Knife surgery on the risk of rupture prior to AVM obliteration. The incidence for hemorrhage in non-obliterated arteriovenous malformations (AVM) during the first two years following Gamma Knife (GK) surgery was compared to the calculated incidence in untreated patients. There was a decrease in the incidence of hemorrhage as compared to the natural course. This difference was statistically significant. The actual number of hemorrhages during the first two years was 49 in a series of 1604 patients. Additionally, 41 hemorrhages occurred beyond the two years following treatment over the entire follow up time span of up to 24 years. For the first two years the calculated incidence was roughly two times higher than the observed incidence. This impact on the natural history was detectable already within six months after the treatment for the malformations totally covered with at least 25 Gy. The relation between a high minimum and a high average dose on the one hand and a lower risk for hemorrhage on the other hand was statistically significant. Low treatment doses and high age correlated to a higher risk. Neither hemorrhage prior to treatment nor time interval between presenting hemorrhage and treatment seemed to influence the risk for post treatment hemorrhage. The risk for permanent neurological deficit or death due to AVM rupture during the latency period between the time of treatment and total nidus obliteration was less than 0.5% for small AVM and 2-4% for large ones during the first two years. Of the 24 patients with sequelae following AVM rupture after treatment 14 died and 10 remained with neurological deficit of different degrees. However, all survivors were self sufficient.",Included

PURPOSE: Investigation of the effects of hyperthermia on the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord with respect to: (a) incidence of paralysis, (b) latency, (c) histopathology, and (d) tumor induction.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Rat lumbosacral spinal cord with the cauda equina was single-dose irradiated with 15 to 32 Gy of x-rays. Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat. Second, latency for paralysis was shortened in the lower dose range. Third, no difference in pathology between x-rays alone or in combination with hyperthermia. Fourth, hyperthermia did increase radiation carcinogenesis.",Included

1320,"Effect of low dose radiation on cognition, cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status. Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behaviour and cognitive functions. These changes depend largely on the dose received and time. While high radiation doses can cause severe tissue destruction, lower doses can induce cognitive impairments without signs of overt tissue damage. Radiation-induced cognitive impairments are reported to occur in up to 50-90% of adult brain tumour patients who survive more than 6 months post-irradiation. This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days. And a blood Serotonin and cortisol analysis was carried out using ELISA kits. Results obtained were analysed using one-way ANOVA. There was a significant decline in exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in open field test. We observed a significant decline in spontaneous Percent Alternation indicating the short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. 1 and 3 Gy irradiated mice exhibited increased anxiety in EPM. The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were statistically not significant. The changes to cortisol level were in a dose dependent manner and serotonin levels decreased with dose. Total antioxidant levels also showed the decreasing trend with respect to radiation doses, this pattern is similar to the pattern of cognitive decline shown in behaviour analysis suggesting that the antioxidant status maybe co-related to the radiation induced cognitive decline.

Thymopentin (10 mg/kg/day/7 days) was injected intraperitoneally in groups of C57BL/6 mice. Then, interleukin-1 alpha was administered on day 7. Twenty hr later, all groups were given whole body sublethal irradiation of 750 rad by 60Co elements. In some groups of mice, treatment with thymopentin was continued for 1 week after irradiation. Efficacy of the combination treatment was assessed by evaluation of mortality, as well as by histologic examination of the brain, testis, bone marrow, heart and spleen. The combination of relatively low doses of interleukin-1 alpha (700 U) with thymopentin yielded a survival which was nearly that observed with interleukin-1 alpha (1000 U) given alone (about 100%). The optimal effect was observed in animals treated for 15 days with thymopentin, either in combination or alone. In addition, incidence and severity of histological lesions were also lower in animals with the some treatment schedule.

The paper describes for the first time the results of the radiation effect study using the example of the analysis of circulatory system disease mortality in newly established cohort combining the population exposed in 1950-1960 due to 2 radiation incidents in the Southern Urals (the Techa River and East-Urals radioactive Trace). The cohort consists of 60,205 people. Over a 65-year follow up period 14,830 deaths from all diseases of the circulatory system were registered. Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence. The obtained results are in good agreement with those received in the analysis of the effect in the Techa River Cohort in 2013. The latter covered a 53-year period (with minimum latent period of 15 years) and revealed statistically significant linear dose response for all diseases of the circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy - 0.036) and ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy - 0.056).

The ability to self-renew throughout life and the reproducible recovery after injury, make it a model tissue to study mechanisms underlying neurogenesis. In this study, X-rays were used to disrupt proliferating olfactory stem cell populations and to assess their role in the cellular and morphological changes involved in olfactory neurogenic processes.RESULTS: We have analysed the histological and functional effects of a sub-lethal dose of X-rays on the adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium at 2 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks and 5 weeks. We have shown an immediate cessation of proliferating olfactory stem cells as shown by BrdU, Ki67 and pH3 expression. At 24 hours there was an increase in the neural transcription factors Mash1 and Pax6 expression, and a disruption of the basal lamina and increase in glandular cell marker expression at 1 week post-irradiation. Coincident with these changes was an impairment of the olfactory function in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significant changes in basal cell proliferation as well as morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium following X-ray irradiation.

The biological effects of focal gamma ray irradiation on targeted or surrounding areas in the brain are not well-known. In the present study, we evaluated protein expression changes in the unilateral irradiated (60 Gy) striatum in rat. Striata of irradiated and control brains were dissected 16 h post-irradiation for analysis by large-format two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). In parallel, we also examined the un-targeted contralateral striatum over the control for potential changes in proteins patterns that may have occurred due to the effects of irradiation to the unilateral striatum. A total of 17 reproducible and differentially expressed silver nitrate-stained protein spots in the irradiated striatum was detected on 2-D gel. Their subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 13 nonredundant proteins. Interestingly, out of these 13 changed proteins, 2 proteins were also detected in the contralateral striatum. Some of the significantly changed proteins identified were creatine kinase, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDA3), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2). Western analysis with anti-PDA3 and anti-Prx2 antibodies revealed 4 and 2 cross-reacting protein spots on 2-D gel blots.

BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) irradiation has detrimental effects which become evident within hours to few days and after a long latency of months and years. However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE.

1531,"Hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown. The vascular endothelial cell is believed to be a major target cell of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is associated with radiation-induced white matter lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Adult rats were irradiated with graded single doses of 0-22 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 28 weeks after radiation, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry with antialbumin antibody and gamma counting of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Hypoxia was assessed using two 2-nitroimidazole markers, [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-l-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF5), with binding in the rat spinal cord measured using gamma counting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the nonirradiated rat spinal cord, there was no evidence of BSCB disruption or VEGF expression. After 16-22 Gy, there was a dose-dependent increase in albumin staining and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid activity beginning at 16 weeks, consistent with barrier breakdown. A similar dose-dependent increase in white matter astrocytes that showed immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals for VEGF was observed. No increase in VEGF-positive cells was observed in gray matter. By 20 weeks after 20-22 Gy, animals developed white matter necrosis associated with diffuse albumin staining. Irradiated rat spinal cord showed a dose (16-22 Gy)- and time-dependent (16-20 weeks after 22 Gy) increase in [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise accumulation compared to nonirradiated controls. A similar pattern of dose- and time-dependent EF5 immunoreactivity was also observed in white matter. Areas of EF5 expression and VEGF in situ signals colocalized with areas of albumin immunoreactivity. It is concluded that there is a dose-dependent temporal and spatial association of hypoxia, VEGF up-regulation, and radiation-induced BSCB dysfunction. Hypoxia may provide the signal for VEGF up-regulation and perpetuate endothelial permeability damage in the central nervous system after ionizing radiation.",Included

In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere.

Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction.",Included

PURPOSE: To explore the mechanism of facial nerve recovery after radiotherapy by simulating surgical treatment of parotid gland carcinoma with reserving facial nerve and studying the ability of aerobic metabolism, transmission of neurotransmitter, variation of ultrastructure of motor end and mitochondrion after radiotherapy during operation. METHOD(S): Animal models of treatment group(15Gy) and lethal dose group(17Gy) were established. Succinic dehydrogenase(SDH) and acetylcholine lipase(AchE) of orbicularis oris were measured after radiotherapy. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. RESULT(S): The activity of SDH and AchE declined after radiotherapy. There was significant difference between treatment group and lethal dose group. One month later, there was a significant improvement in the activity of SDH and AchE in treatment group, while that of lethal dose group continued to decline. CONCLUSION(S): After radiotherapy during parotid gland surgery, the activity of SDH and AchE, transmission of neurotransmitter, and the ability of aerobic metabolism decreased. The ultrastructure of motor end and mitochondrion was destroyed. The variation returned to preoperative levels in treatment group, while did not in lethal dose group.",Included

Changes in pinealocytes (PC) were analysed using quantitative electron microscopy in 240 adult male rats from first minutes up to 180 days after their continuous exposure to bright light (CLE) for 48 hours, X-ray irradiation (XRI) or their combination (CE). After CLE early changes of PC included the reduction of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi complex and synaptic ribbons. At 24 hours and 10 days PC secretory activity was increased, while their ultrastructural organization was normalized by 30-180 days. 10 days after XRI degenerative changes were detected in PC that included dilation, fragmentation and vacuolization of RER cisterns, mitochondrial swelling, appearance of large vacuoles and osmiophilic inclusions, increase in lysosome content. Volume density of mitochondria and RER was lower, while that of Golgi complex was higher than in control. PC ultrastructure was restored 30-180 days after XRI. Following CE, the changes in PC ultrastructural organization were more significant at all time interval studied than after the action of single factors. The results obtained indicate that CLE increased the extent of postradiation changes in PC ultrastructural organization during the early time intervals after XRI and at the peak of radiation sickness development.",Included

1570,"Terrestrial isopods congregate under a low-level beta-emitter source. Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, but very few experiments have investigated the biological effects of the natural background radiation at very low doses (>10 mGy/yr). We examined whether the background radiation, or radiation of a slightly higher level, has a role in evoking changes in behaviors of terrestrial isopods (woodlice). Upon exposure to a source giving 15 times the background level placed at one end of a box, a significant increase in the number of woodlice gathering under the beta-source was observed with time, as compared with the sham control. Terrestrial isopods have chemoreceptors (the olfactory system) on the terminal segment of their antennae. An additional experiment confirmed the involvement of these antennae in the radiation effect on behavior. After the excision of the antennae, no beta-taxis response was observed. The behavior of the group exposed to the source giving 30 times the background tended to decrease gradually in the area of the source, and the individuals aggregated in the area away from the source. Thus, the olfactory sensor in the antennae may be an important organ involved in the prompt response to radiation exposure, and the discrimination of the radiation field strengths of radioisotopes.",Included

Prolonged deep space missions to planets and asteroids will expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), a mixture of low-LET ionizing radiations, high-energy protons and high-Z and energy (HZE) particles. Ground-based experiments are used to determine whether this radiation environment will have an effect on the long-term health of astronauts and their ability to complete various tasks during their mission. Emerging data suggest that mission-relevant HZE doses impair several hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive processes in rodents, but that there is substantial interindividual variation in the severity of neurocognitive impairment, ranging from no observable effects to severe impairment. While the majority of studies have established the effect that the most abundant HZE species (<sup>56</sup>Fe) has on neurocognition, some studies suggest that the lighter <sup>48</sup>Ti HZE particles may be equally, if not more, potent at impairing neurocognition. In this study, we assessed the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti had on the spatial memory performance of socially mature male Wistar rats. Acute exposures to mission-relevant doses (<=5 cGy) of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the mean spatial memory performance of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly (P < 0.015) increased the percentage of rats that have severe (Z score >= 2) impairment, i.e., poor performers.

Background: We sought to determine the surgical treatment and functional outcome and identify the predictors of survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal cord ependymoma using data collected from the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group database. Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. Â© 2013 The Author(s).",Included

Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established.",Included

Spaceflight decreased the expression of crucial genes involved in DA synthesis and degradation, as well as the D1 receptor. However, spaceflight failed to alter the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-2, 5-HT transporter, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT3 receptor genes, though it reduced 5-HT2A receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus.

Focussed radiosurgery may provide a means of inducing molecular changes on the luminal surface of diseased endothelium to allow targeted delivery of novel therapeutic compounds. We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included
1631,"Radiation-induced changes in the profile of spinal cord serotonin, prostaglandin synthesis, and vascular permeability. PURPOSE: To investigate the profile of biochemical and physiological changes induced in the rat spinal cord by radiation, over a period of 8 months.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The thoraco-lumbar spinal cords of Fisher rats were irradiated to a dose of 15 Gy. The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system.",Included

This study describes ultrastructural changes in the pigmented hooded Lister rat retina, 3-12 months following X-irradiation with single doses of between 200 and 2000 cGy. The extreme radiosensitivity of the photoreceptor cells was underlined by the continued manifestation of fine structural changes and cell death up to 6 months post-radiation in animals receiving doses above 500 cGy. The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were more radioresistant than photoreceptors and RPE cell loss was only observed at doses of more than 1500 cGy. One year after irradiation with 1500 cGy the retinal vasculature showed capillary occlusion with some evidence of recanalisation. Telangiectasia was observed in the large retinal veins. Although the inner retinal neurones and glial cells showed no evidence of direct radiation damage, the nerve fibre layer adjacent to occluded retinal vessels demonstrated ultrastructural evidence of ischaemic neuropathy and retinal oedema.

The authors carried out studies on 267 male rats and examined the effect of ionizing irradation (single irradation with 737 roentgens) on the duration of swimming and on the alteration of this effect by psychic stimulators caffeine and methylphenidate, administered in overthreshold doses (30 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for caffeine and 5 and 10 mg/kg of body weight for methylphenidate). On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced. The cyclic AMP is presumed to have some protective effect against ionizing irradiation.",Included

Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels seen after radiation treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE2 production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE2 production and PGES expression.RESULTS: As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE2 levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE2 seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE2 production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.",Included

PURPOSE: To elucidate with a histopathological study the mechanism of region-dependent volume effects in the partly irradiated parotid gland of the rat.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Wistar rats were locally X-irradiated with collimators with conformal radiation portals for 100% volume and 50% cranial/caudal partial volumes. Single doses up to 40 Gy were applied. Parotid saliva samples were collected, and the three lobes of the parotid gland were examined individually on the macro- and micromorphologic level up to 1 year after irradiation.RESULTS: Dose-dependent loss of gland weight was observed 1 year after total or partial X-irradiation. Weight loss of the glands correlated very well with loss of secretory function. Irradiating the cranial 50% volume (implicating a shielded lateral lobe) resulted in substantially more damage in terms of weight loss and loss of secretory function than 50% caudal irradiation (shielding the ventral and dorsal lobe). Histologic examinations of the glands 1 year after irradiation revealed that the shielded lateral lobe was severely affected, in contrast to the shielded ventral and dorsal lobes. Time studies showed that irradiation of the cranial 50% volume caused late development of secondary damage in the shielded lateral lobe, becoming manifest between 240 and 360 days after irradiation. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the observed region-dependent volume effect for late function loss in the rat parotid gland after partial irradiation is mainly caused by secondary events in the shielded lateral lobe. The most probable first step (primary radiation event) in the development of this secondary damage is radiation exposure to the hilus region (located between the ventral and dorsal lobe). By injuring major excretory ducts and supply routes for blood and nerves in this area, the facility system necessary for proper functioning of the nonexposed lateral lobe is seriously affected. The unexpected volume effect in the rat might have consequences for treatment strategies in radiotherapy, implicating not only salivary glands but also other organs with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of radiosensitive elements, a situation wherein volume effects have not been anticipated up to now.",Included

1748,"Gene expression in rat vestibular and reticular structures during and after space flight. Space flight produces profound changes of neuronal activity in the mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs)] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was compared to that of ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and 1 and 14 days after landing. An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight.",Included

Astronauts on lengthy voyages will be exposed to an environment of microgravity and ionizing radiation that may have adverse effects on physical abilities, mood, and cognitive functioning. However, little is known about the long-term effects of combined microgravity and low-dose radiation. We exposed mice to gamma radiation using a cobalt-57 plate (0.01 cGy/h for a total dose of 0.04 Gy), hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, or a combination of both for 3 weeks. Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction.",Included
1804,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury. Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation.

1819,"Lipid alteration following proton beam irradiation in mouse brain of radiation necrosis model. INTRODUCTION: Brain radiation necrosis (RN) is irreversible severe adverse effect after radiation therapy for brain tumors over 60 Gy. Effective treatment for this irreversible event has not been established. The lying mechanism of RN is to be elucidated in order to establish a new therapy. We have established brain RN mouse model using proton beam at the Wakasa Wan Energy research Center. In this model, RN was induced 8 months after irradiation and the histology of the necrosis recapitulated the human RN patients [Kondo N.2015]. So far, some researchers investigated the mechanism of RN based on protein level. However, with the advanced mass spectrometry technology, lipid mediator response to ionizing radiation was reported [Laiakis EC, 2014]. Therefore, in this study, lipid alteration after proton beam irradiation was investigated in mouse brain RN model using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizing imaging mass spectrometry (HR-MALDI-IMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generation of mouse brain RN model: C57BL/6J mice were irradiated in the restricted area of right brain at 60 Gy using proton beam. Tissue preparation: After 4 months later mouse was sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with cold PBS. The brain was extracted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in-80degreeC. The brain was sliced to a thickness of 4 mum with a cryostat and placed onto an indium tin oxide coated glass slide and stored at-20 degreeC until matrix application and subsequent HR-MALDI-IMS analysis. Each slide was anchored in vacuum deposition equipment and coated with 9-aminoacridine hemihydrates (9-AA) matrix layer obtained by sublimation at 220degreeC. The sequential sections were mounted onto glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis: HR-MALDI-IMS analysis was performed on a high-resolution microscopic imaging mass spectrometer (iMScope; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry data were acquired in negative and positive mode in the mass range of m/z 700-1000. Statistical Analysis: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed by Imaging MS Solution (ver 1, 12, 26; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). RESULT(S): Compared to non-irradiated area, in the irradiated right hemisphere, i) elevation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (34:1, 36:4, 36:1, 38:6, 40:6) and ii) decline of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (36:4, 38:4) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): The data indicated the phospholipid alterations after irradiation in mouse brain RN model in the chronic phase before establishment of RN. Further analysis for component of these phospholipids may include the precursor of lipid mediator, arachidonic acid (AA) or other fatty acids. We will investigate time-dependent change of phospholipids using mouse brain RN model and HR-MALDI-IMS analysis then finally find the responsible lipid mediators which induce brain RN.",Included

1842,"Ionizing radiation induces structural and functional damage on the molecules of rat brain homogenate membranes: a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study. Humans can be exposed to ionizing radiation, due to various reasons, whose structural effects on biological membranes are not well defined. The current study aims to understand the ionizing radiation-induced structural and functional alterations in biomolecules of brain membranes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using rat animal models. For this purpose, 1000 cGy of ionizing radiation was specifically directed to the head of Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were decapitated after 24 h. The results revealed that the lipid-to-protein ratio decreased and that irradiation caused lipid peroxidation and increases in the amounts of olefinic =CH, carbonyl, and methylene groups of lipids. In addition, ionizing radiation induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, disordering of membrane lipids, strengthening of the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate groups of lipid head-groups, and weakening in the hydrogen bonding of the interfacial carbonyl groups of lipids. Radiation further caused significant decrements in the alpha-helix and turns, and significant increments in the beta-sheet and random coil contents in the protein structure. Hierarchical cluster analyses, performed in the whole region (3030-1000 cm(-1)), lipid (3030-2800 cm(-1)), and protein (1700-1600 cm(-1)) regions separately, successfully differentiated the control and irradiated groups of rat brain membranes and showed that proteins in the membranes are affected more than lipids from the damages induced with ionizing radiation. As a result, the current study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy can be used successfully as a novel method to monitor radiation-induced alterations on biological membranes.",Included

Background: The relationship between whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) dose with intracranial tumor control and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases (BM) is largely unknown. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 595 NSCLC BM patients treated consecutively at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between 2013 to 2015. We assigned the patients into 4 dose groups of WBRT: none, < 30, 30-39, and >= 40 Gy and assessed their relationship with OS and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS). Cox models were utilized. Covariates included sex, age, KPS, BM lesions, extracranial metastasis, BM and lung tumor resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and focal radiotherapy modalities. Result(s): Patients had a mean age of 59 years and were 44% female. Their median survival time (MST) of OS and iPFS were 9.3 and 8.9 months. Patients receiving none (344/58%), < 30 (30/5%), 30-39 (93/16%), and >= 40 (128/22%) Gy of WBRT had MST of OS (iPFS) of 7.3 (6.8), 6.0 (5.4), 10.3 (11.9) and 11.9 (11.9) months, respectively. Compared to none, other WBRT groups had adjusted HRs for OS - 1.23 (p > 0.20), 0.72 (0.08), 0.61 (< 0.00) and iPFS - 1.63 (0.03), 0.71 (0.06), 0.67 (< 0.01). Compared to 30-39 Gy, WBRT dose >=40 Gy was not associated with improved OS and iPFS (all p > 0.40). Stratified analyses by 1-3 and >= 4 BM lesions and adjustment analyses by each prognostic index of RPA class, Lung-GPA and Lung-molGPA supported these relationships as well. Conclusion(s): Compared to none, WBRT doses >=30 Gy are invariably associated with improved intracranial tumor control and survival in NSCLC BM patients. Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).",Included
1850,"The Effects of Low-Dose-Rate gamma-irradiation on Forced Swim Test-Induced Immobility and Oxidative Stress in Mice. The forced swim test (FST) induces immobility in mice. Low-dose (high-dose-rate) X-irradiation inhibits FSTinduced immobility in mice due to its antioxidative function. We evaluated the effects of low-dose gamma-irradiation at a low-dose-rate on the FST-induced depletion of antioxidants in mouse organs. Mice received whole-body low-dose-rate (0.6 or 3.0 mGy/h) of low-dose gamma-irradiation for 1 week, followed by daily FSTs (5 days). The immobility rate on day 2 compared to day 1 was significantly lower in the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice than in sham irradiated mice. The FST significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) activity and total glutathione (t-GSH) content in the brain and kidney, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and t-GSH content in the liver of the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice were significantly lower than those of the non-FST-treated mice. The CAT activity in the lungs of mice exposed to 3.0 mGy/h gamma-irradiation was higher than that of non-FST treated mice and mice treated with FST. However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these antioxidant markers between the sham and irradiated groups except for the CAT activity in lungs. These findings suggest that the effects of low-dose-rate and low-dose gamma-irradiation on FST are highly organ-dependent.",Included

The pathogenesis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is poorly understood and precursor cells are not known. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development. The findings provide insight into the tumorigenesis of de novo GBMs and suggest a new strategy for treatment of these lethal tumors by targeting both inactivation of N-CoR and inhibition of EGFR.",Included
1870,"Early effects of whole-body (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function in C57BL/6J mice. Relatively little is known about early irradiation effects on hippocampal function in wild-type mice. In this study, the effects of (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function were assessed starting 2 weeks after whole-body irradiation. Compared to sham irradiation, radiation impaired novel object recognition in female and male C57BL/6J wild-type mice. There were no effects of irradiation on contextual fear conditioning or spatial memory retention in the water maze. It is possible that oxidative damage might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive changes. Therefore, hippocampal and cortical levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and lipid peroxidation, measures of oxidative damage were assessed. There were no effects of irradiation on these measures of oxidative damage. As (56)Fe irradiation can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which may contribute to the impairments in novel object recognition, the effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on cognition following sham irradiation and irradiation were also assessed. ALA did not prevent radiation-induced impairments in novel object recognition and impaired spatial memory retention of sham-irradiated and irradiated mice in the probe trial after the first day of hidden platform training in the water maze. Thus, the novel object recognition test is particularly sensitive to detect early cognitive effects of (56)Fe irradiation through a mechanism unlikely involving ROS or oxidative damage.",Included

Currently, NASA has plans for extended space travel, and previous research indicates that space radiation can have negative effects on cognitive skills as well as physical and mental health. With long-term space travel, astronauts will be exposed to greater radiation levels. Research shows that an antioxidant-enriched diet may offer some protection against the cellular effects of radiation and may provide significant neuroprotection from the effects of radiation-induced cognitive and behavioral skill deficits. Ninety-six C57BL/6 mice (48 pomegranate fed and 48 control) were irradiated with proton radiation (2 Gy), and two-month postradiation behaviors were assessed using a battery of behavioral tests to measure cognitive and motor functions. Proton irradiation was associated with depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test, but this effect was ameliorated by the pomegranate diet. Males, in general, displayed worse coordination and balance than females on the rotarod task, and the pomegranate diet ameliorated this effect. Overall, it appears that proton irradiation, which may be encountered in space, may induce a different pattern of behavioral deficits in males than females and that a pomegranate diet may confer protection against some of those effects.",Included

Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33).

However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups.",Included

C-fos and junB, but not c-jun, mRNA was induced within 15 min in unanesthetized irradiated mice. Induction was transient and lasted < 4 h. The response was dose-dependent with increases in c-fos and junB mRNA levels after dose of > or = 2 and 7 Gy, respectively. Anesthesia of mice with pentobarbitol delayed the increases in mRNA expression and the response was attenuated. Pre-treatment of mice with dexamethasone, in a schedule which suppressed acute-phase gene expression after brain irradiation, did not significantly change c-fos and junB induction.

Maximal activity of 2-oxoglutarate- and succinate dehydrogenases, as well as of aspartate-2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate-2-oxoglutarate in the brain tissue was measured within 30 days after the exposure. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in the brain cortex, limbic system and in the cerebellum; transaminase activity was determined in the brain cortex, diencephalic zone and in the hypophysis. It was found that small doses of irradiation resulted in an oscillating increase of dehydrogenase activity with a decrease of the amplitude by the 30th day of the experiment. As the dose of irradiation increases, the periods of normal activity change into phases of inhibition of dehydrogenase action, the period of oscillations diminishes. Transaminase activity, as a rule, changes in a phase in a reversible manner as compared with dehydrogenase activity. These observations are discussed from the point of view of structural relations between these two systems in the intramitochondrial supramolecular structures, the so-called metabolons.",Included

Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination.

We looked at several epidemiological factors including age and symptoms at diagnosis, and the treatment chosen for each individual.RESULTS: The incidence rate of AN in Iceland is 1.24/100,000. About 10% of diagnosed tumors were found incidentally. Most of those were found in the last 10 years of the investigation and in that period fewer large and giant tumors at diagnosis. Present complaints of patients at diagnosis were hearing loss (69%), dysequilibrium/dizziness (47%) and tinnitus (43%).

The mechanisms underlying impairments in cognition are not clear but might involve alterations in the percentage of neurons in the dentate gyrus expressing the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Previously, we showed effects of cranial <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation on hippocampus-dependent contextual freezing and on the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed, but not free, blade. Because it is unclear whether whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation causes similar effects on these markers of hippocampal function, in the present study we quantified the effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation (600MeV, 0.5 or 1Gy) on hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent cognitive performance and determined whether these effects were associated with changes in Arc expression in the enclosed and free blades of the dentate gyrus. Whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation impacted contextual but not cued fear freezing and the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In addition, in mice irradiated with 0.5Gy, contextual freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed blade. In mice tested for cued freezing, there was no correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In contrast, cued freezing in the presence or absence of aversive stimuli correlated with Arc-positive cells in the free blade. In addition, in mice irradiated with 1Gy cued freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive neurons in the free blade. These data indicate that while whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation affects contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, the enclosed blade might be more important for contextual freezing while the free blade might be more important for cued freezing.

Growing evidence suggests that radiation-induced oxidative stress directly affects a wide range of biological changes with an overall negative impact on CNS function. In the past we have demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing human catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) exhibit a range of neuroprotective phenotypes following irradiation that include improved neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and cognition. To determine the extent of the neuroprotective phenotype afforded by MCAT expression in different hippocampal regions, we analyzed subiculum neurons for changes in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity after exposure to low dose (0.5 Gy) 150 MeV proton irradiation. One month following irradiation of WT and MCAT mice, a range of morphometric parameters were quantified along Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons. Compared with WT mice, subiculum neurons from MCAT mice exhibited increased trends (albeit not statistically significant) toward increased dendritic complexity in both control and irradiated cohorts. However, Sholl analysis of MCAT mice revealed significantly increased arborization of the distal dendritic tree, indicating a protective effect on secondary and tertiary branching. Interestingly, radiation-induced increases in postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) puncta were not as pronounced in MCAT compared with WT mice, and were significantly lower after the 0.5 Gy dose. As past data has linked radiation exposure to reduced dendritic complexity, elevated PSD-95 and impaired cognition, reductions in mitochondrial oxidative stress have proven useful in ameliorating many of these radiation-induced sequelae. Data presented here shows similar trends, and again points to the potential benefits of reducing oxidative stress in the brain to attenuate radiation injury. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 57:364-371, 2016.

A highly specific localization of GSH in the cerebellum and hippocampus was observed. Secondly, we measured the elevation of GSH level in the brain after low-dose gamma-irradiation. The cerebral GSH levels increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reaching a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, then remaining significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated control until 12 h and returning to the control level by 24 h. Thirdly, we examined the induction of the activities and the mRNAs of proteins involved in the synthesis and regeneration of GSH in the brain of mice subjected to low-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was significantly increased at 0.5 h, and remained high until 2 h post-irradiation (50 cGy). The level was transiently lowered to the non-irradiated control level at 3 h and slightly increased again after 6 h post-irradiation. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly increased 3 h after irradiation, and remained high up to 24 h post-irradiation. As for glutathione reductase, the mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h, and peaked strongly at 2 h, while the enzyme activity was significantly increased at 6 h after irradiation, and continued to increase up to 24 h. The level of mRNA for thioredoxin, which contributes to GSH biosynthesis by supplying cysteine to the de novo pathway, peaked between 0.5 h and 2 h post-irradiation, and rapidly declined thereafter. The content of thioredoxin showed a transient decrease immediately after irradiation, but was then remarkably elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 h, and thereafter declining sharply. These results indicate that the increase in endogenous GSH in mouse brain soon after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation is a consequence of the induction of GSH synthesis-related proteins and occurs via both the de novo synthesis and the regeneration pathways.",Included

BACKGROUND: The present study examined the long-term cognitive implications of cancer treatment among breast cancer survivors aged 65 years and older to better understand the long term implications of cancer treatment.METHODS: Fifty-seven women survivors were compared with 30 healthy older female adult comparisons, matched in terms of age and education, with no history of cancer. Cancer survivors were also compared on the basis of treatment intervention, involving chemotherapy (n = 27) versus local therapy through surgery and radiation (n = 30).RESULTS: As a group, the breast cancer survivors scored lower on measures of general cognitive function, working memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function when compared with the normal comparisons. Among the cancer survivors, those who received local therapy scored lower than the other survivors and normal comparisons on measures of verbal learning, visual perception and construction, as well as visual attention and short-term retention.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cognitive outcomes may involve greater age-related deficits among older cancer survivors compared with matched healthy subjects.",Included

Contractile properties of skeletal muscles of rats were investigated using glycerinated muscle preparations that were obtained from Cosmos-1887 animals flown for 13 days (plus 2 days on the ground) and from rats that remained hypokinetic for 13 days on the ground. In the flow rats, the absolute mass of postural muscles remained unchanged while their relative mass increased; this may be attributed to their enhanced hydration which developed during the first 2 days after landing. Strength losses of the postural muscles were less significant than after previous flights. Comparison of the Cosmos-1887 and hypokinesia control data has shown that even 2-day exposure to 1 G after 13-day flight can modify drastically flight-induced changes.",Included

In 61% of them neurocirculatory dystonia was found, 39% of patients revealed dyscirculatory encephalopathy. Alongside with dystonic disorders structural changes of vessels were detected. Asthenoneurosis diagnosed in 97% of patients was recognized as a key syndrome in 53%, while in 23%--obsessional-phobic syndrome dominated, in 7%--depressive syndrome and in 14%--psycho-organic syndrome were at the foreground. Somatic status in most patients (67%) was burdened by diseases of digestive tract. 191 patients revealed considerable immune imbalance. In 95 patients (33%) it was less pronounced and consisted in moderate decrease of TPR/TPS ratio. Degrees of immune and neurological disorders correlated closely. The conclusion was made that low-dose radiation induces primary damage of immunity and vessels with secondary nervous system involvement.

Mitochondria are linked with various radiation responses, including mitophagy, genomic instability, apoptosis, and the bystander effect. Mitochondria play an important role in preserving cellular homeostasis during stress responses, and dysfunction in mitochondrial contributes to aging, carcinogenesis and neurologic diseases. In this study, we have investigated the mitochondrial degeneration and autophagy in the hippocampal region of brains from mice administered with BBT-059, a long-acting interleukin-11 analog, or its formulation buffer 24 h prior to irradiation at different radiation doses collected at 6 and 12 months post-irradiation. The results demonstrated a higher number of degenerating mitochondria in 12 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 6 months and 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 12 months as compared to the age-matched naive (non-irradiated control animals). Apg5l, Lc3b and Sqstm1 markers were used to analyze the autophagy in the brain, however only the Sqstm1 marker exhibited significantly reduced expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to naive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of Bcl2 also demonstrated a decrease in expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to other groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure.",Included

UNLABELLED: Objective - to estimate the possible effects of low dose ionizing radiation on human cognitive function in adult hood and in utero.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive tests, telomere length and expression of genes regulating telomere function were studied in Chornobyl cleanup workers who were exposed to doses under 500 mSv (n = 326) and subjects exposed in utero during the first days after the accident Prypiat town (n = 104). The neurocognitive assessment covered mem ory, attention, language, executive and visiospatial functions. In young adults after prenatal exposure a relation ship was analyzed between a cognitive function and radiation dose to foetus, brain and thyroid gland. Internal con trols were used for both groups - the group of Chornobyl cleanup workers exposed in doses less than 20 mSv and an age matched comparison group from radioactively contaminated areas for subjects exposed in utero.RESULTS: Cognitive functions in cleanup workers exposed to ionizing radiation at adulthood are characterized by symptoms of a mild cognitive impairment according to the MMSE (mean group score 25,58 +/- 2,95) and a significant ly higher level of mental disorders according to the BPRS in a dose related manner. Cleanup workers exposed to doses over 500 mSv demonstrate a significant cognitive deficit in comparison with those exposed below 500 mSv and espe cially non exposed patients. Subjects exposed in utero during the check at age of 25-27 years exhibit an excess of the disorders of autonomic nervous system (ICD 10: G90). Neurological microsymptoms as well as neurotic, stress relat ed and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) dominate. Relationship were revealed between the TERT, TERF1, TERF2 genes expression, relative telomere length (RTL),cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular pathology, radiation dose and age. Telomere length in cleanup workers is sreduced after 50 years (6.1 %). The most significant reduction in telomere length is shown after 70 years (11.7 %). Negative correlation was found between telomere length and degree of cog nitive deficit (MMSE scale) and between age and degree of cognitive deficit. The RTL is significantly decreased in groups of persons with cognitive deficit compared to a comparison group. Telomere length at the late period after low dose radiation exposure is downregulated by the high TERF2 gene expression combined with low expression of TERT gene. After exposure to doses over 250-500 mSv a cognitive deficit and dementia were associated with a substantial increase in TERT gene expression, overexpression of TERF1 and decrease in expression of TERF2 gene. A relationship was revealed between the TERF2 gene expression and CD95+ cell fraction susceptible to apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cognitive deficit in humans at a late period after radiation exposure is influ enced by dose, age at exposure and gene regulation of telomere function.",Included

In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",Included

Each of the forms of motor deprivation hindered the elaboration of DR; gamma-irradiation aggravated these disorders. At the same time, AOH led to significantly more severe disturbances in the higher nervous activity including the generalized excitation, pathologic aggressiveness and neurotization of animals.

At 2 months post-irradiation, cellular markers of inflammation (total, activated, and newborn microglia) and neurogenesis (newborn neurons) were measured in 40 mum sections of the dentate gyrus (DG).RESULTS: Although the total number of microglia in the DG/hilus was not significantly different (p > 0.7) in unirradiated, single dose, and fWBI rats, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.003) increase in the percent-activated microglia; fWBI did not (p > 0.1). Additionally, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.002) dose-dependent increase in surviving newborn microglia; fWBI did not (p < 0.8). Although total proliferation in the DG was reduced equally by single and fWBI doses, single doses produced a significant dose-dependent (p < 0.02) decrease in surviving newborn neurons; fWBI did not (p > 0.6).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the rat brain's cellular response to single doses often does not predict its cellular response to 'biologically equivalent' fWBI doses.",Included

This radiation, even in a lethal dose, was found to induce no significant changes in the hepatic levels of cAMP. In contrast, an abrupt short-lasting increase in the levels of cAMP was observed in brain and intestinal mucosa after a 500-rd-irradiation, and a progressive long-lasting increase in its levels in the intestinal mucosa and, especially, in the brain was found after a 750-rd-irradiation.

Research by our group has shown that exposure to HZE particles, primarily 600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n 56Fe, can produce significant alterations in brain neurochemistry and behavior. However, given that protons can make up a significant portion of the radiation spectrum, it is important to study their effects on neural functioning and on related performance. Therefore, these studies examined the effects of exposure to proton irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints, including dopaminergic functioning, amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion learning, and spatial learning and memory as measured by the Morris water maze.

Irradiation with a total dose of 14.4 Gy decreased NAT activity and the concentration of pineal and serum melatonin 6 h and 3 days after the last exposure. The activity of MAO, estimated only in the rats irradiated with the dose of 14.4 Gy, increased significantly 3 days after irradiation. The fractionated irradiation up to the dose of 14.4 Gy caused a transient decrease in pineal melatonin synthesis.

The midline of the neck and skull was always inside the radiation field. The animals were sacrificed either 6 months or 12 months after completion of the randomly assigned irradiation protocol. Five non-irradiated rats served as controls.RESULTS: No TM developed in the non-irradiated animals. Out of 60 irradiated rats 9 developed a pituitary TM (15%). In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas.

The dysregulation of normal S-nitrosylation contributes to degenerative conditions and to cancer.

In the brain, ionizing radiation induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier by effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. Damage from directly irradiated cells can be transferred to surrounding non-exposed bystander cells, known as the radiation-induced bystander effect. We investigated involvement of connexin channels and paracrine signaling in radiation-induced bystander DNA damage in brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to focused X-rays. Irradiation caused DNA damage in the directly exposed area, which propagated over several millimeters in the bystander area. DNA damage was significantly reduced by the connexin channel-targeting peptide Gap26 and the Cx43 hemichannel blocker TAT-Gap19. ATP release, dye uptake, and patch clamp experiments showed that hemichannels opened within 5 min post irradiation in both irradiated and bystander areas.

This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT.

Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype.",Included

Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts.

Material(s) and Method(s): The rats were randomly divided into four groups and each group included 10 rats; group 1 (Control group), group 2 (intraperitoneally CoQ10 administered), group 3 (radiation applied) and group 4 (both radiation applied and intraperitoneally CoQ10 administered). Rats were administered dose of 10mg/kg/day CoQ10 intraperitoneally, and underwent radiation therapy through a posterior portal covering the thorax and the abdomen. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and CoQ10 levels and activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase enzymes in renal tissue were studied. Result(s): MDA levels significantly increased and CoQ10 levels significantly decreased in the liver and kidney tissues of the radiation applied group as compared to the control group (p <0.05). Conclusion(s): These results show that CoQ10 has not adequate protective and antioxidant effects on acute renal and liver tissue injuries in radiation induced rats.",Included

Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner. These persistent changes in neuronal function are likely to be a consequence of the actions of ionizing radiation on the physiological processes that influence the neuronal environment.",Included
2423,"Changes of aggressive behavior and brain serotonin turnover after very low-dose X-irradiation of mice. Social isolation has been widely described to induce compulsive aggressive behavior and produce a large decrease of brain serotonin turnover in male mice. The aggressiveness by isolation in mice has been often used as a means for a better understanding of disturbed behavior in human beings. We found that male ICR white Swiss mice exhibiting isolation-induced aggression became gradually calm and showed remarkably quiet behavior 7 to 10 days after whole body irradiation of very low-dose X-rays (5-15 cGy). Higher doses (25-35 cGy), however, could not induce such effects. We also obtained the data on brain biochemistry giving a further support for the above low-dose effects on the mouse behavior. Brain serotonin turnover which has been known to be related to aggressive behavior in 5 or 15 cGy irradiated mice was faster than in aggressive control animals.",Included

2439,"Alteration of Interneuron Immunoreactivity and Autophagic Activity in Rat Hippocampus after Single High-Dose Whole-Brain Irradiation. The effects of high dose gamma radiation on brain tissue are poorly understood, with both limited and major changes reported. The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation.",Included

PURPOSE: To investigate the possible role of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and rutin in ameliorating the biochemical changes in brain and serum induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in whole body gamma-irradiated rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats (either irradiated or non-irradiated) followed by reperfusion.RESULTS: I/R increased brain content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and depleted its glutathione (GSH) content with a compensatory elevation in cytosolic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes. It also raised brain cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and calcium (Ca(2+)) level. Furthermore, I/R provoked an inflammatory response reflected by an increment in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interlukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Moreover, induction of I/R in irradiated rats resulted in a further increase in brain oxidative stress and cytosolic LDH activity, disturbed brain Ca(2+) homeostasis and exaggerated the inflammatory reaction. During irradiation, administration of each of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and rutin to irradiated rats before induction of I/R, alleviated the brain oxidative stress. Moreover, these antioxidants caused attenuation of the rise of the cytosolic activities of GPx and GR. A lowering effect of the cytosolic LDH activity and Ca(2+) level were caused by treatment with antioxidants. Each of vitamin E and rutin revealed an anti-inflammatory action of these antioxidants, while CoQ10 had no effect on serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that supplementation with either vitamin E, CoQ10 or rutin ameliorated most of the biochemical changes induced by I/R in irradiated rat brain and serum.",Included

PURPOSE: We developed a co-culture system to quantitate the growth and invasion of human malignant gliomas into a background of confluent normal human astrocytes, then used this assay to assess independently the effects of irradiating both cell types on glioma invasion.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled immortalized human astrocytes, human malignant glioma cells, or transformed human astrocytes were focally plated onto a confluent layer of normal human astrocytes, and the invasiveness of EGFP-labeled cells was scored after 96 h. To address the consequences of irradiation on glioma invasion, the invasiveness of irradiated glioma cell lines and irradiated astrocytic backgrounds was assessed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to quantitate the total number of EGFP-labeled cells.RESULTS: Growth in the co-culture assay consistently reflected transformation states of the plated cells. Immortalized, but untransformed human astrocytes failed even to establish growth on confluent normal human astrocytes. In contrast, all malignant human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes demonstrated various degrees of infiltration into the astrocytic bed. Irradiation failed to alter the invasiveness of U87, A172, and U373. A 1-Gy dose slightly reduced the invasiveness of U251 MG by 75% (p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Neuman-Keuls), without reducing total cell numbers. Independently irradiating the human astrocytic bed did not alter the invasiveness of nonirradiated U251, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 reduced U251 invasiveness in the co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: Growth in the co-culture assay reflects the transformation status and provides a useful in vitro model for assessing invasiveness. Human glioma invasiveness in the co-culture model responds variably to single low-dose fractions. MMP activity promotes invasiveness in the co-culture model. Reduced invasiveness in irradiated U251 appears to be mediated by MMP-independent mechanisms.",Included

This paper describes the response of mouse small intestine, at several time points after treatment with neutron or X-irradiation, using doses expected to give similar effects in terms of crypt/microcolony survival. Using resin histology, the effects of radiation on the numbers of duodenal cell types and measurements of tissue areas were assessed. The results for individual parameters and for an estimate of overall damage are given in a data display, which summarises the morphological profile of the organ after both types of radiation. Damage and recovery were seen for many of the parameters studied but there was no standard response pattern applicable for all parameters. In particular, the response of individual crypt cell types could not be predicted from knowledge of the change in crypt numbers. With regard to the holistic response of the gut, neutron irradiation appeared to have caused more damage and produced more early effects than the X-irradiation. More specifically, neutron treatment led to more damage to the neuromuscular components of the wall, while X-irradiation produced early vascular changes.",Included

Conversely, these rays were found to have no significant effect on the hepatic prostaglandin F2alpha and to induce, depending on the radiation dose, a reversible or an irreversible decrease in the content of cerebral prostaglandin F2alpha.

The radiobiologic parameters that characterized the dose-response survival curve for these cells were found to be n = 1.9, Dq = 140 rad, and D0 = 190 rad. Morphologically, nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation of cytoplasm, and giant cell formation occurred in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours from irradiation. Decreased staining intensity for F VIII RAg was observed in morphologically affected cells. The capacity to synthesize PGI2 was significantly enhanced at 24 hours, but less significant at 72 hours after irradiation.

2486,"Central infusion of the melanocortin receptor antagonist agouti-related peptide (AgRP(83-132)) prevents cachexia-related symptoms induced by radiation and colon-26 tumors in mice. Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc.

2517,"Metallothionein induction in human CNS in vitro: neuroprotection from ionizing radiation. PURPOSE: There have been extensive studies on the regulation of metallothionein (MT) synthesis, and its biological role in liver and kidney. Although there are few reports on brain MT, there is a growing interest in the role of MT in brain. There have been no publications to date on MT synthesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) following exposure to ionizing radiation. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures were used to examine the effect of ionizing radiation on MT mRNA and protein synthesis. In the same cultures, the neuroprotective effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd)-induced MT synthesis from high-dose radiation were also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary, serum-free, human CNS cultures were exposed to 30 or 60 Gy gamma-rays. The total MT protein was then measured by a Cd-heme assay, and mRNA for MT-II and MT-III was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release and apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis. Sublethal neuroglial injury was assessed morphologically using specific astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein--GFAP) and neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2--MAP2) immunohistochemical markers.RESULTS: The total MT protein content was increased 12h after exposure to 30Gy. The increase in MT content in response to 60Gy was not statistically significant. MT-II mRNA levels increased at 3 and 6h after exposure to 30Gy gamma-rays, with a maximum expression at 12-24 h. MT-III mRNA was not significantly affected. Exposure to 60 Gy, but not 30 Gy, caused a marked increase in LDH release. Cells exposed to 30 Gy or less showed some apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis, while exposure to 60 Gy resulted in a DNA smear confirmed by LDH assays. Preinduction of MT by 5 microM Cd or 100 microM Zn resulted in a significant reduction in radiation-induced LDH release. Morphological evaluations revealed that Cd or Zn preincubation led to relative preservation of MAP2 staining and GFAP.CONCLUSION: Both MT protein and MT-II mRNA can be induced in human CNS cells by ionizing radiation. Furthermore, induction of MT synthesis with Zn and Cd can protect human CNS cells from radiation-induced cytocidal and sublethal injuries. Both findings have implications in the development of strategies to protect human CNS tissue from damage during radiotherapy.",Included

There were no effects on performance of any group of animals when tested on an ascending fixed-ratio operant task 6 months following exposure. When tested 12 months after exposure, the performance of the radiated animals given blueberry extract did not differ from the radiated animals fed the control diet. Both groups performed significantly poorer than the non-irradiated controls. There were no differences between the non-irradiated animals fed control diet and the radiated animals fed the strawberry diet and their performance was significantly better than of the radiated rats fed the blueberry or control diets.

Mechanical injury to the adult mammalian spinal cord results in permanent loss of structural integrity at the lesion site and of the brain-controlled function distal to the lesion. Some of these consequences were permanently averted by altering the cellular constituents at the lesion site with x-irradiation delivered within a critical time window after injury. We have reported in a separate article that x-irradiation of sectioned adult rat spinal cord resulted in restitution of structural continuity and regrowth of severed corticospinal axons across and deep into the distal stump. Here, we report that after x-ray therapy of the lesion site severed corticospinal axons of transected adult rat spinal cord recover electrophysiologic control of activity of hindlimb muscles innervated by motoneurons distal to the lesion. The degree of recovery of control of muscle activity was directly related to the degree of restitution of structural integrity. This restitution of electrophysiologic function implies that the regenerating corticospinal axons reestablish connectivity with neurons within the target field in the distal stump. Our data suggest that recovery of structural continuity is a sufficient condition for the axotomized corticospinal neurons to regain some of their disrupted function in cord regions distal to the lesion site.",Included

Cognitive deficit is one of the most serious complications of cranial radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of this cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) were investigated following whole-brain irradiation (WBI). Young male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent WBI at a single dose of 10 Gy. WBI was determined to result in notable memory decline and substantial neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus 3 months post-irradiation. Compared with the control group, TrkA protein expression was greater in irradiated rats 1 week after WBI, which then decreased significantly by the 3-month time-point. However, no difference in NGF expression was observed from 1 day to 3 months post-WBI. Overexpression of hippocampal TrkA in rats using adeno-associated virus ameliorated memory decline induced by irradiation. Additionally, upregulating TrkA expression rescued irradiation-induced hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and promoted neurogenesis. PI3K, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also revealed to be significantly inhibited by WBI, which was ameliorated by TrkA overexpression.

The accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract plays a central role in the pathology of human Huntington's disease. We found that the huntingtin gene contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and p53 binds to these elements both in vivo and in vitro. p53 activation in cultured human cells, either by a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein or by gamma-irradiation (gamma-irradiation), increases huntingtin mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, murine huntingtin also contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and its expression is induced by p53 activation in cultured cells. Moreover, gamma-irradiation, which activates p53, increases huntingtin gene expression in the striatum and cortex of mouse brain, the major pathological sites for Huntington's disease, in p53+/+ but not the isogenic p53-/- mice. These results demonstrate that p53 protein can regulate huntingtin expression at transcriptional level, and suggest that a p53 stress response could be a modulator of the process of Huntington's disease.",Included

We investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation on microglia stimulated with Zymosan A and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which alone induce the expression of some cytokines and neurotoxic products by microglial cells. In the resting condition (ramified microglia), radiation had no effect on the mRNA level corresponding to cytokines such as IL1beta or IL-6, although TGF-beta1 mRNA was minimally enhanced by irradiation. However, in the activated microglia (amoeboid microglia) stimulated with Zymosan A, radiation-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased about two-fold in comparison with non-irradiation. IL-1beta was slightly induced by 2 Gy irradiation, but was not induced by higher doses. TGF-beta1 mRNA was not enhanced by radiation following Zymosan stimulation. In the LPS-stimulated condition, IL-6 mRNA was induced only by 2 Gy of irradiation, but no change in the expression of other genes was detected. These results suggested that radiation exerted different effects on cytokine gene transcription in microglia depending on their morphological state.",Included
2678,"Effects of neuro-immuno-modulation on healing of wound combined with local radiation injury in rats. PURPOSE: To investigate effects of neuro-immuno-modulation on wound healing by observing changes of cytokines and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones in acute stress reaction in rats with wound and combined local radiation injury.METHODS: Sixty female Wistar rats (weighting 200 +/- 20 g) were randomly divided into normal control group, wound group and combined wound-local radiation (CWR) group (25 Gy local radiation post wound), 20 rats in each group. Contents of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma and IL-4 in serum were measured and changes of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoid (GC) in serum were analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunologic assay, respectively at different time points post wound and radiation.RESULTS: (1) The level of IFN-gamma, one of the Th1 cell cytokines increased significantly at 14 d post CWR, which was markedly higher than that in control group and wound group. However, the level of IL-4, IL-1beta and IL-6, one of the Th2 cell cytokines, did not show obvious change. (2) Ratio of Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) in wound group and CWR group increased significantly at 7 d after wound and radiation, which suggested that Th1/Th2 balance drifted to Th1 immune response. The ratio of Th1/Th2 in wound group returned to the normal level up to 14 d after the wound and radiation, while the Th1/Th2 ratio in CWR group increased persistently and was much higher than that in control and wound groups. (3) Level of serous ACTH and GC in CWR group increased at 3 d post wound and radiation, and among them, level of GC showed statistically significant increase, which was much higher than that in control and wound groups.CONCLUSION: Level of serous neurohormone GC in rats increased significantly immediately after wound and radiation; while the level of IFN-gamma showed significant increase only up to 14 d after wound and radiation, and the Th1/Th2 imbalance sustained till 28 d post wound and radiation. In order to reduce acute damage caused by CWR, organic immune system and nerve system showed up a marked regulate effects simultaneously and mutually. Nonetheless, the excessive stress induced by CWR causes disturbance of immunoregulation, which is one of the key reasons for delayed wound healing in CWR.",Included
2684,"Age dependence of the radiosensitivity of glial progenitors for In vivo fission-neutron and X irradiation. O-2A progenitor cells are the stem cells of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. In the epithermal reactor beams used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for treatment of brain tumors, fission neutrons are a contaminating component. To estimate the radiosensitivity of the O-2A progenitors for fission neutrons, an in vivo-in vitro clonogenic assay was used. Radiosensitivity of progenitors obtained from the spinal cord of 1- or 5-day-old rats or the optic nerve of 2- or 12-week-old rats for 1 MeV fission neutrons was compared to that for 300 kVp X rays. Dose-survival curves were fitted according to the linear-quadratic model. The resulting beta component was very small to negligible. Progenitor cells obtained from rats of different ages show differences in radiosensitivity, characterized by different alpha values. RBE values for fission neutrons were 3.5 for 1-day-old spinal cord, 3.2 for 5-day-old spinal cord, 3.0 for 2-week-old optic nerve, and 4.3 for 12-week-old optic nerve. These high RBE values indicate the importance of minimizing the fast-neutron component in the epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT.",Included
2691,"Enhanced excitability induced by ionizing radiation in the kindled rat. Evidence derived from both clinical and experimental investigations has suggested an influence of ionizing radiation on focal epileptogenicity. To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala. The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes. Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala, after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation. The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated (60)Co source (1.25 MeV). Generalized seizure thresholds were then redetermined at weekly intervals for 10 weeks and at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months. We observed no significant changes in seizure threshold during the postirradiation interval; however, we did observe persistent changes in seizure dynamics manifesting within the first week postirradiation. These consisted of an increased tendency for seizure activity to propagate into brain stem circuits during the primary ictus (i.e., ""running fits"") and an increased tendency for secondary convulsions to emerge postictally. These effects involving seizure dynamics have not been reported previously and appear to represent a radiation-induced disinhibition of one or more neural circuits. The disparity between these effects and earlier reports of seizure-suppressive effects resulting from analogous radiation exposures is discussed in relation to kindling and status epilepticus-induced pathogenesis within the hippocampus.",Included

2716,"A model for assessing cognitive impairment after fractionated whole-brain irradiation in nonhuman primates. To investigate the effect of fractionated whole-brain irradiation on nonhuman primates, 6-9-year-old male rhesus monkeys were irradiated with 40 Gy delivered as two 5-Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed 5 days/week for 4 months prior to fractionated whole-brain irradiation and for 11 months after irradiation using a Delayed-Match-to-Sample (DMS) task at both low and high cognitive loads. Local rates of cerebral glucose metabolism were measured prior to and 9 months after irradiation using [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography. Low cognitive load trials did not reveal a significant reduction in performance until 7 months after irradiation; performance then declined progressively. In high cognitive load trials, the initial impairment was observed ~1 month after irradiation. This was followed by a transient recovery period over the next 1-2 months, after which performance declined progressively through 11 months after irradiation. Nine months after irradiation, glucose uptake during the DMS task was decreased in the cuneate and prefrontal cortex and was increased in the cerebellum and thalamus compared with the levels prior to irradiation. Results from this pilot study suggest that the radiation-induced changes in cognition and brain metabolism observed in rhesus monkeys may be similar to those observed in brain tumor patients receiving brain irradiation.",Included

2758,"Use of synchrotron medical microbeam irradiation to investigate radiation-induced bystander and abscopal effects in vivo. The question of whether bystander and abscopal effects are the same is unclear. Our experimental system enables us to address this question by allowing irradiated organisms to partner with unexposed individuals. Organs from both animals and appropriate sham and scatter dose controls are tested for expression of several endpoints such as calcium flux, role of 5HT, reporter assay cell death and proteomic profile. The results show that membrane related functions of calcium and 5HT are critical for true bystander effect expression. Our original inter-animal experiments used fish species whole body irradiated with low doses of X-rays, which prevented us from addressing the abscopal effect question. Data which are much more relevant in radiotherapy are now available for rats which received high dose local irradiation to the implanted right brain glioma. The data were generated using quasi-parallel microbeams at the biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France. This means we can directly compare abscopal and ""true"" bystander effects in a rodent tumour model. Analysis of right brain hemisphere, left brain and urinary bladder in the directly irradiated animals and their unirradiated partners strongly suggests that bystander effects (in partner animals) are not the same as abscopal effects (in the irradiated animal). Furthermore, the presence of a tumour in the right brain alters the magnitude of both abscopal and bystander effects in the tissues from the directly irradiated animal and in the unirradiated partners which did not contain tumours, meaning the type of signal was different.",Included
2759,"Chromosomal in-vitro radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in radiotherapy patients and AT-homozygotes. BACKGROUND: We investigated the in-vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes with a special FISH/CISS-technique.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1993 through April 1996, a total number of 52 cancer patients was enrolled in the study. The tumor sites in these patients were: breast (n = 41), lung (n = 4), head and neck (n = 3) as well as prostate, bladder, rectal cancer and Hodgkin's disease (each n = 1). Twenty-six of them were examined prior to planned radiotherapy (prospective group) and 26 after radiotherapy (retrospective group). Three additional individuals (without cancer or radiotherapy) with proven ataxia telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome, AT-homozygotes) were also investigated and their blood samples served as positive control for radiosensitivity. The clinical radiation response of normal tissue in radiotherapy patients was scored according to the WHO grading system for acute and according to the RTOG grading system for late effects. For to estimate the intrinsic radiosensitivity, blood samples were taken and irradiated in vitro with 0 (control) or 0.7 or 2 Gy with a 6 MV-linear accelerator, standard 48-hour lymphocyte cultures were prepared, chromosomes #1, #2 and #4 were simultaneously labeled with a FISH/CISS-technique and 200 to 1,000 metaphase spreads were scored for chromosomal aberrations. The radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes was expressed as the number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks per mitosis after 0.7 Gy or 2 Gy corrected for the 0-Gy control value.RESULTS: The frequency of chromosomal breaks/mitosis in the unirradiated control lymphocytes was 0.020 +/- 0.015 in prospective patients who had not yet received radiotherapy. It was significantly higher in retrospective patients (0.264 +/- 0.164 breaks/mitosis) as a result of the previous radiation exposure. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed also an increased number of spontaneous chromosomal breaks (0.084 +/- 0.016 breaks/mitosis), probably resulting from the chromosomal instability in this disease. This figure, however, was significantly lower than in retrospective patients. The number of radiation-induced breaks after in-vitro irradiation was comparable in lymphocytes of patients who showed no normal tissue reaction (n = 11) as compared to those with mild to moderate radiation reaction (n = 32, acute reactions Grade 1 to 2, late reactions Grade 0 to 2). In 9 patients with unexpected severe plus late Grade 3 to 4 reactions, however, a significantly higher number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks was measured; the highest number was observed in a patient with a radiation myelitis. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed, as expected, an extreme radiosensitivity of their lymphocytes. The number of breaks/mitosis after 0.7 Gy in vitro irradiation of lymphocytes was 0.103 +/- 0.059 in patients with no normal tissue radiation reaction (n = 11), 0.122 +/- 0.146 in the group with mild to moderate radiation reactions Grade 1 to 2 (n = 32), 0.359 + 0.226 in patients with unexpected Grade 3 to 4 normal tissue reactions (n = 9) and 0.550 +/- 0.243 in the 3 AT-homozygotes (p < 0.01, t-test). The difference in lymphocyte radiosensitivity between these 4 groups was also detected after in-vitro irradiation with 2 Gy (0.484 +/- 0.132 vs. 0.535 +/- 0.228 vs. 0.926 +/- 0.349 vs. 1.423 +/- 0.072).CONCLUSIONS: We found a significantly higher number of chromosomal breaks in lymphocytes of patients with severe or extreme radiation reaction of normal tissues as compared to patients with no or only mild to moderate radiation reactions. The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in these radiosensitive patients was in the range between normal radiosensitivity and the radiosensitivity of AT-homozygotes. Detection of patients with severely enhanced intrinsic radiosensitivity might be possible with this method.",Included

The antimutagenic effects of the radiation protective agent, S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721), were studied against fission-spectrum-neutron- and 60Co-gamma-ray-induced mutagenesis in mice. Mutagenesis at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus was measured 56 days following whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons (single doses, 50-150 cGy) or 60Co photons (single doses, 250-750 cGy). Splenic T lymphocytes from B6CF1 mice were grown in round-bottomed 96-microwell culture plates with or without the selective agent 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The mutant frequency, as a result of exposure to neutrons or 60Co photons, increased 100-fold with dose. Doses of 150 cGy neutrons and 750 cGy 60Co photons were equally mutagenic. When animals were injected with WR-2721 at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight, i.p., 30 min before whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons or 60Co photons, mutant frequencies were significantly reduced at all radiation doses (i.e. protection factors of 1.4 and 2.4, respectively). Thus, the aminothiols are effective antimutagens. A novel clinical application of these compounds could be in their use to protect against radiation- and/or chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage to normal cells.",Included

2790,"Study of antioxidative effects and anti-inflammatory effects in mice due to low-dose X-irradiation or radon inhalation. Low-dose irradiation induces various stimulating effects, especially activation of the biological defense system including antioxidative and immune functions. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cell damage and death and can induce many types of diseases. This paper reviews new insights into inhibition of ROS-related diseases with low-dose irradiation or radon inhalation. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before or after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment inhibits hepatopathy in mice. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before ischemia-reperfusion injury or cold-induced brain injury also inhibits edema. These findings suggest that low-dose X-irradiation has antioxidative effects due to blocking the damage induced by free radicals or ROS. Moreover, radon inhalation increases superoxide dismutase activity in many organs and inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. These findings suggest that radon inhalation also has antioxidative effects. This antioxidative effect against CCl4-induced hepatopathy is comparable to treatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at a dose of 500 mg/kg weight, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment at a dose of 300 mg/kg weight, and is due to activation of antioxidative functions. In addition, radon inhalation inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema, suggesting that radon inhalation has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, radon inhalation inhibits formalin-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that radon inhalation relieves pain. Thus, low-dose irradiation very likely activates the defense systems in the body, and therefore, contributes to preventing or reducing ROS-related injuries, which are thought to involve peroxidation.",Included
2817,"Divergent effects of irradiation on brain cortical morphology in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: one-year follow-up study using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Background: Increasing evidence indicates that radiotherapy (RT)-induced brain cortical deficits may play a critical role in developing radiation encephalopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the evolutional processes of RT-induced cortical injury have not been sufficiently investigated. This study investigates RT-induced effects on cortical morphology using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPC patients.Methods: Using MRI-based morphometry with surface-based measures, we evaluated the longitudinal alterations of cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 104 NPC patients at pre-RT (n=104), within 3 months post-RT (n=92), 6 months post-RT (n=71), and 9-12 months post-RT (n=52). Twenty healthy controls were also evaluated in parallel. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies.",Included

Background: Prior research has indicated neuroanatomical abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia. To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Method(s): Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Result(s): Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusion(s): A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood. Low-dose irradiation of the fetal primate may be useful for modeling key features of the pathology described in schizophrenic patients. Â© 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Included

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either PCI (100 patients) or no PCI (111 patients). Each centre was allowed to use its own PCI protocol as long as the total dose was within the range of 24-30 Gy and delivered in less than 3 weeks with fractions of 3 Gy or less.

This method uses synchrotron-generated x-ray microbeams. Rats were implanted with 9L gliosarcomas and the tumors were diagnosed by MRI. They were irradiated 14 days after implantation by arrays of 25 microm wide microbeams in unidirectional mode, with a skin entrance dose of 625 Gy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restenosis complicates a significant proportion of endovascular and open vascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy. In contrast to the primary atheroma, restenosis is characterized by intimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that gamma radiation would reduce restenosis by limiting intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.METHODS: To demonstrate the effect of gamma radiation on smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo, a standardized bilateral carotid balloon catheter arterial injury was produced in 37 rats. A single dose of 750, 1500, or 2250 cGy (1cGy = 1 rad) gamma radiation was delivered to the right carotid artery at either 1 or 2 days after injury; the shielded contralateral carotid artery served as matched control. At 21 days after injury, vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ, and cross-sectional area of neointima was determined from axial sections using image analysis.RESULTS: Marked reductions in neointimal cross-sectional area were demonstrated in vessels subjected to 1500- and 2250-cGy radiation at both 1 and 2 days after injury. A less prominent effect was noted for 750 cGy, reaching statistical significance only at 2 days after injury. By two-way ANOVA, radiation dose (P = .0002), timing of radiation delivery (P = .003), and an interaction between timing and dose (P = .0278) were significantly associated with reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. At 1500 cGy, delivery of radiation 1 day after injury inhibited neointimal hyperplasia more prominently than the same dose 2 days after injury; a dose-response relation was evident at 1 day.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation may be an important adjunctive therapy for reducing the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty or endarterectomy.",Included

2941,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain caused by acute radiation injuries. Moderate to severe acute pain is a common consequence of fullcourse radiotherapy. Improved analgesics are needed, but therapeutic development requires an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie acute radiation-associated pain (RAP). Our preliminary data suggest that transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels on sensory neurons play important roles in RAP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of various Trp channels in acute RAP using a mouse model of oral radiation-induced mucositis. Mice underwent high dose single fraction lingual irradiation or sham irradiation. This resulted in glossitis that was most severe at 10-12 days postirradiation and resolved within 20 days. Micewere euthanized on days 1, 5, 11, 21, and 45 post-irradiation. Functional analysis of trigeminal ganglia neurons was assessed via calcium imaging; this revealed significantly increased proportions of neurons that were sensitive to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), histamine (TRPV4 partial agonist), or TNF-alpha (a general inflammatory marker). These changes were seen as early as 1-day post-irradiation and lasted until the 21st day. Via quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented Trpv1 overexpression in the trigeminal ganglia neurons of tongueirradiated mice on days 11 and 21. Together, these results indicate that both TRPV1 and TRPV4 are activated and upregulated, and contribute to the acute response of oral tissues to therapeutic irradiation. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing these two Trp channels as potential targets for RAP mitigation in human and animal cancer patients.",Included

Complications were measured by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Among 103 patients, 39 (38%) had radiation exposure prior to CxUD. Mean age for patients with radiation exposure undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion was significantly higher (69.8 vs 59.7 years, p=0.001). In patients receiving preoperative radiation, 23.1% (9/39) had congestive heart failure (p=0.005). Other preexisting conditions such as diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, renal disease and liver disease were not associated with radiation exposure. Operative time (p=0.861), estimated blood loss (p=0.756) and length of stay (p=0.776) were not associated with radiation exposure. There was a significant correlation between radiation exposure and having a preoperative diagnosis of genitourinary fistulae (p=0.001), neurogenic bladder (p<0.0001) and urethral stricture (p=0.002). Radiation exposure did not correlate to readmission at 30 days (p=0.256) or at 90 days (p=0.576). Ureteroileal strictures requiring interventional radiology procedures were observed in 6 patients (5.8%) and stomal stenosis was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). Neither variable was correlated with radiation exposure (p=0.27 and p=0.265, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In spite of patients being older with more comorbidities at baseline, patients with preoperative radiation exposure undergoing CxUD for benign indications did not have increased readmission at 30 or 90 days or increased complications postoperatively. Additionally, operative parameters such as surgery time, estimated blood loss and length of stay were similar between radiation and naive patient groups. These findings suggest radiation exposure prior to CxUD may not portend as negative consequences as once thought.",Included
2969,"Treatment Outcomes of Incidental Intracranial Meningiomas: Results from the IMPACT Cohort. Background: Incidental findings such as meningioma are becoming increasingly prevalent. There is no consensus on the optimal management of these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of patients diagnosed with an incidental meningioma who were treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Method(s): Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with an incidental intracranial meningioma (2007-2015). Outcomes recorded were postintervention morbidity, histopathologic diagnosis, and treatment response. Result(s): Out of 441 patients, 44 underwent treatment. Median age at intervention was 56.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49.6-66.5); patients included 35 women and 9 men. The main indication for imaging was headache (25.9%). Median meningioma volume was 4.55 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR, 1.91-8.61), and the commonest location was convexity (47.7%). Six patients underwent surgery at initial diagnosis. Thirty-eight had intervention (34 with surgery and 4 with radiotherapy) after a median active monitoring duration of 24 months (IQR, 11.8-42.0). Indications for treatment were radiologic progression (n = 26), symptom development (n = 6), and patient preference (n = 12). Pathology revealed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningioma in 36 patients and WHO grade 2 in 4 patients. The risk of postoperative surgical and medical morbidity requiring treatment was 25%. Early and late moderate adverse events limiting activities of daily living occurred in 28.6% of patients treated with radiotherapy. Recurrence rate after surgery was 2.5%. All meningiomas regressed or remained radiologically stable after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The morbidity after treatment of incidental intracranial meningioma is not negligible. Considering most operated tumors are WHO grade 1, treatment should be reserved for those manifesting symptoms or demonstrating substantial growth on radiologic surveillance.

2989,"Quality of life after palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma - A prospective comparison between stent placement and single dose brachytherapy. Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma. We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after these palliative treatments. Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent (n=108) or single dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101). We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific (dysphagia score, European Organisation for Reasearch and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) OES-23, visual analogue pain scale) and generic (EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnarie (QLQ-C30), Euroqol (EQ)-5D) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse. We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P<0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up. Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups, general pain levels increased to a minor extent. The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer. Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales, since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales.

3002,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer: findings from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group pooled analysis. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (>=70 years of age) from a pooled analysis of four prospective trials.MATERIALS & METHODS: One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.",Included

By the methods of quantitative cytochemistry the content of RNA cytoplasmatic protein was measured in motoneurons of anterior horns of the spinal cord and neurons of spinal ganglia of rats after their 22-day space flight. The exposure did not alter the content of RNA in motoneurons of the anterior horns of the spinal cord and reduced the value in large neurons of spinal ganglia. The flight diminished significantly the protein content in the cytoplasm of motoneurons and neurons of spinal ganglia as compared with the preflight level. On the 27th postflight day the RNA content in motoneurons of the anterior horns of the spinal cord increased and that in neurons of spinal ganglia did not differ from the preflight level. On the 27th postflight day the protein content in the cytoplasm of motoneurons returned to the preflight level and remained decreased in the cytoplasms of large neurons of spinal ganglia.,Included
3018,"Cellular Senescence in Mouse Hippocampus After Irradiation and the Role of p53 and p21. Diverse stress signals including irradiation may trigger cellular senescence. We asked whether irradiation induced senescence in mouse hippocampus, and whether p53 or p21 played a role in this response. Following whole-brain irradiation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays for senescence-associated genes showed increased expression of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p19ARF) in mouse hippocampus at 9 weeks. Upregulation of p21 and p19ARF was confirmed using real-time PCR, which also demonstrated increased CDKN2A/p16INKa expression after irradiation. No altered regulation of another 17 senescence-associated genes was observed after irradiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased nuclear expression of p16INK4A, p19ARF, p53, p21, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and interleukin-6 (IL6) in granule cells of dentate gyrus after irradiation. Increased p16 nuclear immunoreactivity was further observed in type -1 cells, the putative neural stem cells. gamma-phosphorylated-histone-2A nuclear foci were also seen in dentate gyrus 9 weeks postirradiation. In nonirradiated mice knockout of the TRP53 or p21 gene, there was increased p16INK4A, p19ARF, and IL6, but not pp38 in dentate gyrus. We conclude that irradiation induces transcript and protein expression profile alterations in mouse dentate gyrus consistent with the senescence phenotype. Absence of p53 or p21 results in increase in baseline expression of senescence markers with no further increase in expression after irradiation.",Included

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included
3054,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are epigenetically regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Exposure of animal body parts to ionizing radiation (IR) can lead to molecular changes in distant shielded ""bystander"" tissues and organs. Nevertheless, tissue specificity of bystander responses within the same organism has not been examined in detail. Studies on in vivo bystander effect conducted so far analyzed changes induced by single-dose exposure. The potential of fractionated irradiation to induce bystander effects in vivo has never been studied. We analyzed changes in global DNA methylation and microRNAome in skin and spleen of animals subjected to single-dose (acute or fractionated) whole-body or cranial exposure to 0.5 Gy of X-rays. We found that IR-induced DNA methylation changes in bystander spleen and skin were distinct. Acute radiation exposure resulted in a significant loss of global DNA methylation in the exposed and bystander spleen 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after irradiation. Fractionated irradiation led to hypomethylation in bystander spleen 6 hr after whole-body exposure, and 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after cranial irradiation. Contrarily, changes in the skin of the same animals were seen only 6 hr after acute whole-body and head exposure. DNA hypomethylation observed in spleen was paralleled by a reduction of methyl-binding protein MeCP2 expression. Irradiation also induced tissue-specific microRNAome alterations in skin and spleen. For the first time, we have shown that IR-induced epigenetic bystander effects that occur in the same organism are triggered by both acute and fractionated exposure and are very distinct in different bystander organs. Future studies are clearly needed to address organismal and carcinogenic repercussions of those changes.",Included

BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.",Included

Ionizing radiation playsmajor role in the treatment of brain tumours, but side-effects may restrict the efficiency of therapy. In the present study, our goals were to detect the functional and morphological changes that result in the administration of l-alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), a deacylated derivative of phosphatidylcholine, in a rodent model of hippocampus irradiation. Anaesthetized SPRD rats were subjected to 40-Gy irradiation of one hemisphere of the brain, with or without GPC treatment (50 mg/kg per os). After the irradiation the rats received GPC or the vehicle at the same time every second day at 5 days per week. The effects of partial rat brain irradiation on the spatial orientation and learning ability of rats were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, which was performed once before and two times after the irradiation. At the same time morphological changes were detected by MRI to define the time-point for histological examinations. Irradiation of 40-Gy resulted in moderate neurological deficit both at the level of cognitive function and morphology after 4 weeks of irradiation. The MWM test was found to be a highly sensitive tool for the detection of neurofunctional impairment. We found that the place navigational function of the ratswas impaired by the irradiation and the treatment with GPC could prevent this damage. Marked protective effect of the GPC was detected as concerns of the histopathological findings. Targeted brain irradiation induced notable changes in the central nervous system. GPC supplementation provides significant protection against irradiation-caused functional and morphological disturbances.",Included

3070,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research.",Included

Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.",Included

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis whether the effects of GH replacement therapy in adults could be affected by prior pituitary irradiation, the baseline characteristics and response to GH were evaluated in adults with severe GH deficiency (GHD), who had received or not irradiation for the treatment of pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma.DESIGN: Data from 447 patients, who had received radiotherapy (427 in addition to surgery), and 630 patients, who were operated on but not irradiated for their tumour, were retrieved from Pfizer International Metabolic Database (KIMS) and compared at baseline and 1 and 2 years following the onset of GH replacement.RESULTS: Irradiated and non-irradiated patients exhibited the expected phenotype of GHD at baseline. However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response. These beneficial effects were maintained and the BMC also increased in both groups by the second year of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that prior irradiation for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma does not compromise the beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy.",Included

Cerebellum is a vital organ responsible for the motor coordination and recently it has been reported to be involved in cognitive function. Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice. In addition, radiation induced augmentation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and a decline in the total antioxidant capacity in serum; these changes were also ameliorated by melatonin pretreatment.

3115,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence?. Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included

A 0.3-kb cDNA that was consistently observed in irradiated cultures but not in unirradiated cultures was cloned and sequenced. It was found to be identical to Ptk-3, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene identified recently. The protein encoded by Ptk-3 is a member of a novel class of receptor tyrosine kinases whose extracellular domain contains regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of Ptk-3 was increased in rat astrocytes by 0.5 h after exposure to 10 Gy and remained at the same elevated level for at least 24 h. The maximum increase occurred after 5 Gy. Cloning studies indicated the presence of at least two Ptk-3 mRNA transcripts, which are probably the result of an alternative splicing mechanism. The short isoform lacks a 37-amino acid sequence in the glycine/proline-rich juxtamembrane region. The splicing pattern of the Ptk-3 gene was not altered by radiation.

3139,"Cranial irradiation alters dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus. Therapeutic irradiation of the brain is a common treatment modality for brain tumors, but can lead to impairment of cognitive function. Dendritic spines are sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in spine structure and number are thought to represent a morphological correlate of altered brain functions associated with hippocampal dependent learning and memory. To gain some insight into the temporal and sub region specific cellular changes in the hippocampus following brain irradiation, we investigated the effects of 10 Gy cranial irradiation on dendritic spines in young adult mice. One week or 1 month post irradiation, changes in spine density and morphology in dentate gyrus (DG) granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons were quantified using Golgi staining. Our results showed that in the DG, there were significant reductions in spine density at both 1 week (11.9%) and 1 month (26.9%) after irradiation. In contrast, in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, irradiation resulted in a significant reduction (18.7%) in spine density only at 1 week post irradiation. Analysis of spine morphology showed that irradiation led to significant decreases in the proportion of mushroom spines at both time points in the DG as well as CA1 basal dendrites. The proportions of stubby spines were significantly increased in both the areas at 1 month post irradiation. Irradiation did not alter spine density in the CA1 apical dendrites, but there were significant changes in the proportion of thin and mushroom spines at both time points post irradiation. Although the mechanisms involved are not clear, these findings are the first to show that brain irradiation of young adult animals leads to alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus in a time dependent and region specific manner.",Included
3157,"Effects of Radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma: a retrospective analysis of a Single Institution. BACKGROUND: Palliative irradiation of osteolytic lesions is a considerable component in the treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of irradiation in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with multiple myeloma who were admitted to our department between 1989 and 2013. According to the staging system of Durie & Salmon 116 patients were classified as stage III. 107/153 patients were treated with radiotherapy of at least one and up to 6 bony lesions at different times. In order to evaluate the effect of local radiotherapy on pain relief and bone recalcification a uni- and multivariate analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model to correct for multiple measurements. Complete information on dose, fractionation and volume of radiotherapy was available from 81 patients treated in 136 target volumes for pain relief, and from 69 patients treated in 108 target volumes for recalcification. Total radiation doses varied between 8 Gy to 50 Gy (median dose 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions, 5 times a week).RESULTS: Radiotherapy resulted in complete local pain relief in 31% and partial local pain relief in 54% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, higher total radiation doses (p = 0.023) and higher age (p = 0.014) at the time of radiotherapy were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of pain relief, whereas no significant association was detected for concurrent systemic treatment, type and stage of myeloma and location of bone lesions. The same variables were independent predictors for pain relief in the multivariate analysis. Recalcification was observed in 48% of irradiated bone lesions. In the uni- and multivariate analysis higher radiation doses were significantly associated (p = 0.048) with an increased likelihood of recalcification. Side effects of radiotherapy were generally mild.CONCLUSIONS: Higher total biological radiation doses were associated with better pain relief and recalcification in this retrospective evaluation of multiple myeloma patients. In addition, in the elderly the therapeutic measures appear to develop a better analgesic effect.",Included
3158,"Cancer incidence after localized therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Second cancers may occur in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers.",Included
3171,"Targeting of externalized alphaB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations. BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction.METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy).RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mug/mL.CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces. CRYAB provides a novel radiation marker for potential vascular targeting in irradiated brain AVMs.",Included

Hypopituitarism occurring in patients who received external cranial radiation therapy (RT) have been increasingly recognized. Fourteen healthy patients were collected as control Group I, and 25 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were enrolled as Group II. Another 18 NPC patients were enrolled as Group III. Blood was sampled from Group I, Group IIB (before RT), Group IIA (one week after RT) and Group IIIA (1 to 1.5 years after RT). The basal samples were taken for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). The results showed the T3 level was statistically low in Group IIB compared with Group I. The serum GH and FSH (male only) levels were higher and with statistical significance in Group IIA compared Group IIB. Both GH and ACTH levels decreased and PRL increased with statistical significance in Group IIIA compared with Group IIA. The ACTH decreased with statistical significance in Group IIIA compared with Group IIB. Clinical damage to the pituitary is usually manifested months to years after RT.

The control group included 150 healthy people. Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included

3215,"Phase measurement of cognitive impairment specific to radiotherapy. PURPOSE: Memory impairment is an early-delayed effect of radiotherapy (RT). The prospective longitudinal measurement of the cognitive phase effects from RT was conducted on treated and untreated brain tumor patients. The study design investigated semantic vs. perceptual and visual vs. verbal memory to determine the most disease-specific measure of RT-related changes and understanding of the neurotoxicity from RT to the brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tests of memory that had previously shown RT-related phasic changes were compared with experimental tests of memory to test hypotheses about cognition targeted to the neural toxicity of RT. The results from 41 irradiated and 29 nonirradiated patients with low-grade, supratentorial tumors were analyzed. The methods controlled for comorbid white matter risk, recurrence, interval after treatment, and age (18-69 years). The effects were examined before RT and at three points after RT to 1 year using a mixed effects model that included interval, group, surgical status, medication use, practice, and individual random effects. Four new tests of memory and other candidate cognitive tests were investigated, and a post hoc analysis of a comprehensive battery of tests was performed to identify the cognitive processes most specific to RT.RESULTS: The RT effects on memory were identified in the treated group only; among the new tests of memory and the complete neurocognitive battery, the RT effects were significant only for delayed recall (p < 0.009) and interval to recognize (p < 0.002). Tumor location was not related to the treatment effect. Memory decline was specific to retrieval of semantic memories; a double dissociation of semantic from perceptual visual memory was demonstrated in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate memory dependent on the semantic cortex and the hippocampal memory system. A cognitive measurement that is brief but specific to neural mechanisms is effective and feasible for studies of RT damage.",Included
3257,"Chronic Low Dose Neutron Exposure Results in Altered Neurotransmission Properties of the Hippocampus-Prefrontal Cortex Axis in Both Mice and Rats. The proposed deep space exploration to the moon and later to Mars will result in astronauts receiving significant chronic exposures to space radiation (SR). SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.",Included

A palmitoyl derivative of ascorbic acid 2-glucoside, 6-palmitoyl ascorbic acid-2-glucoside (PAsAG), which possess good antioxidant properties, is examined for radioprotection in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. PAsAG protected plasmid DNA from gamma-radiation induced damages under in vitro conditions. Presence of 1.6 mM PAsAG inhibited the disappearance of ccc (covalently closed circular) form of plasmid pBR322 with a dose modifying factor of 1.5. Comet assay studies on mouse spleen cells exposed to 6 Gy gamma-radiation (ex vivo) in presence and absence of PAsAG revealed that cellular DNA was effectively protected by this compound from radiation induced damages. Oral administration of 80 mg/kg body weight of PAsAG to mice 1 hour prior to 6 Gy whole body gamma-radiation exposure, efficiently protected cellular DNA in tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and blood, from radiation induced damages as indicated by alkaline comet assay. Oxidative stress in tissues such as liver and brain of mice, following whole body exposure to various doses of gamma-radiation (2-8 Gy), monitored as levels of GSH and peroxidation of lipids, were found considerably reduced when PAsAG was orally administered (80 mg/kg body weight) to the mice one hour prior to the radiation exposure. PAsAG administration improved the per cent survival of mice following exposure to 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiation. Thus PAsAG could act as a radioprotector under in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo conditions of ionizing-radiation exposure.",Included

Acute disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well recognized after radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed the genetic regulation of acute BBB disruption and its relationship to vascular endothelial cell death in the CNS after irradiation. Adult rats were given graded single doses of X-ray to the cervical spinal cord. At different time intervals after irradiation, the irradiated spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier was assessed using albumin immunohistochemistry, i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. In the rat spinal cord, there was a dose-dependent apoptotic response during the first 24 h after irradiation, and apoptotic cells consisted of both endothelial and glial cells, as described previously (1, 2). A dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell density was observed at 24 h after irradiation. This was associated with a similar dose-dependent disruption in blood-spinal cord barrier as demonstrated by albumin immunohistochemistry. Radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells has been shown to be dependent on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. After a single 50-Gy dose to the cervical spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was a 47.7% reduction in endothelial cell density at 24 h compared with nonirradiated controls. No decrease in endothelial cell density was observed in irradiated ASMase -/- mice. In the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was evidence of albumin immunoreactivity and Evans blue dye staining around microvessels, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake increased at 24 h. Nonirradiated controls and the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase -/- mice demonstrated no evidence of leakage. We conclude that apoptosis of endothelial cells initiates acute BBB disruption in the CNS after irradiation and that acute BBB disruption after irradiation is mediated by the ASMase pathway.",Included

3309,"Possible involvement of hippocampal immediate-early genes in contextual fear memory deficit induced by cranial irradiation. Cranial irradiation can trigger adverse effects on brain functions, including cognitive ability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced cognitive impairments remain still unknown. Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are implicated in neuronal plasticity and the related functions (i.e., memory formation) in the hippocampus. The present study quantitatively assessed changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the learning-induced IEGs, including Arc, c-fos, and zif268, in the mouse hippocampus after cranial irradiation using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mice (male, 8-week-old C57BL/6) received whole-brain irradiation with 0 or 10Gy of gamma-ray and, 2weeks later, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) was used to induce IEGs. In the CFC task, mice evaluated 2weeks after irradiation exhibited significant memory deficits compared with sham (0Gy)-irradiated controls. The levels of mRNA encoding IEGs were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus 10 and 30min after CFC training. The mRNA levels in the irradiated hippocampi were significantly lower than those in the sham-irradiated controls. The IEG protein levels were significantly increased in all hippocampal regions, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA)1, and CA3, after CFC training. The CFC-induced upregulation of Arc and c-fos in 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi was significantly lower than that in sham-irradiated controls, although there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the learning-induced zif268 between sham-irradiated and 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi. Thus, cranial irradiation with 10Gy of gamma-ray impairs the induction of hippocampal IEGs (particularly Arc and c-fos) via behavioral contextual fear memory, and this disturbance may be associated with the memory deficits evident in mice after cranial irradiation, possibly through the dysregulation of neuronal plasticity during memory formation.",Included

We hypothesized that chronic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, to young adult male rats would prevent/ameliorate fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive impairment. Eighty 12-14-week-old young adult male Fischer 344 rats received either: (1) sham irradiation, (2) 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation delivered as two 5 Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks, (3) sham irradiation plus continuous administration of 15 mg/L of ramipril in the drinking water starting 3 days before irradiation, or (4) fractionated whole-brain irradiation plus ramipril. Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, as hypothesized, continuous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can prevent the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function.",Included

In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation.",Included

Although radiotherapy is often used to treat laryngeal carcinoma, there is little information on the effects of this treatment on laryngeal structures.

Ten days after irradiation, a change in the ultrastructural appearance of the granules of the subglottic glands was observed.

At examination 4 6 months after irradiation, there were no obvious differences compared with controls concerning mast-cell numbers and neuropeptide expression. The ultrastructural changes seen in the subglottic glands remained to some extent. The results show that structural changes in the subglottic glands occur concomitantly with an increased expression of certain neuropeptides in the innervation of these glands, which implies a relationship between these two parameters.

INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RVT), a well-known antioxidant agent, on oxidative parameters and erectile function in a rat model of pelvic irradiation. MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

While the effects of high dose X-irradiation on mitotically active progenitor cells and remyelination are well-documented, its effects on myelinating oligodendrocytes are less clear, due in part to divergent views on their mitotic capacity. To examine the effect of X-irradiation on oligodendrocytes, the spinal cord of rats was exposed to 40 Gy of X-irradiation and the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the dorsal funiculi at T12 and L1 was determined by in situ hybridization using cRNA-probes for platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFRalpha) (to identify oligodendrocyte progenitors), exon 3b of proteolipid protein (PLP) (to identify mature oligodendrocytes) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). X-irradiation resulted in no change in the number of PLP positive cells and no loss of myelin internodes, but caused an almost complete loss of PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, and a reduction in the number of MOG positive cells to a number similar to that found using the PLP exon 3b probe. Importantly, the number of radiation-sensitive MOG-expressing cells was similar to the number of PDGFRalpha positive cells. To determine if the radiation-sensitive MOG positive cells were the same population as the radiation sensitive PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, MOG and PDGFRalpha-expressing cells were isolated from the adult CNS using antibody coated magnetic beads. Twelve to thirteen percent of MOG positive cells were PDGFRalpha positive and nearly all the PDGFRa isolated cells were MOG and galactocerebroside positive. Double immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of NG2 and MOG on cells in the normal adult rat spinal cord. These results show that in situ in the adult rat spinal cord white matter oligodendrocyte progenitors are MOG positive and indicates that expression of MOG cannot be regarded a marker that only identifies mature myelin-supporting oligodendrocytes in tissue.",Included

This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters.

The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included

PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with small cell bladder cancer at our institution, including those who received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for the prevention of intracranial recurrence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with small cell bladder cancer treated at a single institution between January 1990 and August 2015 were identified and analyzed retrospectively for demographics, tumor stage, treatment, and overall survival.RESULTS: Of 44 patients diagnosed with small cell bladder cancer, 11 (25%) had metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Treatment included systemic chemotherapy (70%), radical surgery (59%), and local radiation (39%). Six patients (14%) received PCI. Median overall survival was 10 months (IQR 4 - 41). Patients with extensive disease had worse overall survival than those with organ confined disease (8 months vs. 36 months, respectively, p = 0.04). Among those who received PCI, 33% achieved 5 - year survival.CONCLUSION: Outcomes for patients with small cell bladder cancer remain poor.

In the regenerating goldfish optic nerves, Schwann cells of unknown origin reliably infiltrate the lesion site forming a band of peripheral-type myelinating tissue by 1-2 months, sharply demarcated from the adjacent new CNS myelin. To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue.",Included

Background: Limb salvage surgery of popliteal soft tissue sarcomas may be hampered due to the incomplete anatomical containment of this region and the vicinity of neurovascular structures. The scope of this study was to determine outcome and to define risk factors. Patients and Methods: 27 patients (53.3 +/- 15.8 y; 16/27 male) with popliteal soft tissue sarcomas were assessed. Mean follow-up was 40.9 +/- 33.8 months (48.5 +/- 36.7 months in surviving patients). 9/27 patients were included after prior treatment elsewhere (5 after intralesional resections and 4 local recurrences). The lesions were staged IB in 8/27 patients, IIB in 17/27 and III in 2/27. Immediate amputations were performed in 7/27 patients. 15/27 patients were subjected to radiation therapy (preoperative in 6/15 cases), 8/27 patients received chemotherapy (5/8 preoperatively). Result(s): Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 y was 63.0% and 59.5%. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. 8/27 patients developed metastatic disease after 28.9 +/- 9.8 months. Survival (p = 0.397) and disease-free survival (p = 0.113) did not differ in patients after amputations vs limb salvage. Application of radiation therapy was associated with a better survival (p = 0.003). Complications related to the surgical intervention were recorded in 2/27 patients, complications related to radiation therapy occurred in 6/15 patients. Discussion(s): Despite being extra-compartmental, popliteal sarcomas can be treated with a high rate of limb salvage while equal safety compared to amputations is maintained. Irradiation improved survival in our patient population. In cases with involvement of neurovascular structures, preoperative down-staging with radio or chemo-therapy may prevent amputation.

3576,"The role of radiation and chemotherapy in adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas: results from the National Cancer Database. INTRODUCTION: Surgical resection of high-grade brainstem gliomas is challenging and treatment mostly involves radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we utilized registry data to determine prognostic features and impact of chemotherapy and radiation on overall survival.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for adult cases with histologically confirmed high-grade brainstem glioma. Covariates including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and treatment parameters were captured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify predictors of survival.RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were analyzed. Most patients (66.6%) underwent postoperative radiation with chemotherapy, 9.2% underwent radiation alone, while the remaining had no postoperative treatment (24.2%). Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, postoperative chemotherapy with radiation was associated with significant survival benefit compared to radiation alone for grade IV (HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76, p = 0.003), but not for grade III tumors (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.58, p = 0.65).CONCLUSION: Analysis from a national registry illustrated the effectiveness of radiation with chemotherapy for adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas, particularly grade IV. Further research should identify specific patient profiles and molecular subgroups that are more likely to benefit from multimodality therapy.",Included

Primary goals of treatment include normalization of hormonal level and improving visual or neurological symptoms. Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma.

3610,"Effects of combined immune and radiation cancer therapy on inflammatory environment in the brain of a mouse model. Purpose/Objective(s): Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These can include difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and increased anxiety. Though changes are often associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation, these effects are also seen in patients who receive peripheral but no cranial irradiation and no chemotherapy. A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance. These results will be presented at the meeting.",Included

In order to predict the hourly maximum ozone one day in advance based on the meteorological variables for the Wanqingsha site in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, a neural network model (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and a multiple linear regression model were used and compared. Model inputs are meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and solar radiation) of the next day and hourly maximum ozone concentration of the previous day. The OBS (optimal brain surgeon) was adopted to prune the neutral work, to reduce its complexity and to improve its generalization ability. We find that the pruned neural network has the capacity to predict the peak ozone, with an agreement index of 92.3%, the root mean square error of 0.0428 mg/m3, the R-square of 0.737 and the success index of threshold exceedance 77.0% (the threshold O3 mixing ratio of 0.20 mg/m3). When the neural classifier was added to the neural network model, the success index of threshold exceedance increased to 83.6%. Through comparison of the performance indices between the multiple linear regression model and the neural network model, we conclud that that neural network is a better choice to predict peak ozone from meteorological forecast, which may be applied to practical prediction of ozone concentration.",Excluded
403,"Potassium currents in isolated statocyst neurons and RPeD1 in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. To begin to determine the underlying neural mechanisms of memory formation, we studied two different cell types that play important roles in different forms of associative learning in Lymnaea. Statocyst neurons (hair cells) mediate classical conditioning, whereas RPeD1 is a site of memory formation induced by operant conditioning of aerial respiration. Because potassium (K(+)) channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, we initiated studies on these channels in the aforementioned neurons. Three distinct K(+) currents are expressed in the soma of both the hair cells and RPeD1. In hair cells and RPeD1, there is a fast activating and rapidly inactivating 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive A current (I(A)), a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA)-sensitive delayed rectifying current, which exhibits slow inactivation kinetics (I(KV)), and a TEA- and 4-AP-insensitive Ca(2+)-dependent current (I(Ca-K)). In hair cells, the activation voltage of I(A); its half-maximal steady-state activation voltage and its half-maximal steady-state inactivation were at more depolarized levels than in RPeD1. The time constant of recovery from I(A) inactivation was slightly faster in hair cells. I(A) in hair cells is also smaller in amplitude than in RPeD1 and is activated at more depolarized potentials. In like manner, I(KV) is smaller in hair cells and is activated at more depolarized potentials than in RPeD1.",Excluded

414,"A tracking system to calculate patient skin dose in real-time during neurointerventional procedures using a biplane x-ray imaging system. Purpose: Neurovascular interventional procedures using biplane fluoroscopic imaging systems can lead to increased risk of radiation-induced skin injuries. The authors developed a biplane dose tracking system (Biplane-DTS) to calculate the cumulative skin dose distribution from the frontal and lateral x-ray tubes and display it in real-time as a color-coded map on a 3D graphic of the patient for immediate feedback to the physician. The agreement of the calculated values with the dose measured on phantoms was evaluated. Method(s): The Biplane-DTS consists of multiple components including 3D graphic models of the imaging system and patient, an interactive graphical user interface, a data acquisition module to collect geometry and exposure parameters, the computer graphics processing unit, and functions for determining which parts of the patient graphic skin surface are within the beam and for calculating dose. The dose is calculated to individual points on the patient graphic using premeasured calibration files of entrance skin dose per mAs including backscatter; corrections are applied for field area, distance from the focal spot and patient table and pad attenuation when appropriate. The agreement of the calculated patient skin dose and its spatial distribution with measured values was evaluated in 2D and 3D for simulated procedure conditions using a PMMA block phantom and an SK-150 head phantom, respectively. Dose values calculated by the Biplane-DTS were compared to the measurements made on the phantom surface with radiochromic film and a calibrated ionization chamber, which was also used to calibrate the DTS. The agreement with measurements was specifically evaluated with variation in kVp, gantry angle, and field size. Result(s): The dose tracking system that was developed is able to acquire data from the two x-ray gantries on a biplane imaging system and calculate the skin dose for each exposure pulse to those vertices of a patient graphic that are determined to be in the beam. The calculations are done in real-time with a typical graphic update time of 30 ms and an average vertex separation of 3 mm.With appropriate corrections applied, the Biplane-DTS was able to determine the entrance dose within 6% and the spatial distribution of the dose within 4% compared to the measurements with the ionization chamber and film for the SK150 head phantom. The cumulative dose for overlapping fields from both gantries showed similar agreement. Conclusion(s): The Biplane-DTS can provide a good estimate of the peak skin dose and cumulative skin dose distribution during biplane neurointerventional procedures. Real-time display of this information should help the physician manage patient dose to reduce the risk of radiation-induced skin injuries.

PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been applied to inoperable brain metastases in lung adenocarcinoma. Recently, an in vitro study showed reduced clonogenic survival of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) lung cancer cell lines in response to ionizing radiation compared with that of the wild type. To elucidate the role of EGFR mutations in radiation treatment, we evaluated the clinical response to WBRT and survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma who were treated with WBRT. Demographic data, EGFR mutation status, response to WBRT, and survival data were collected. Clinical response was assessed 1 month after the start of WBRT. Univariate and logistic regression models were used to test potential predictive factors associated with clinical response. Log-rank test and Cox regression were analyzed to identify factors that affected survival.RESULTS: Clinical response to WBRT was observed in 29 patients (46%), with 34 nonresponder patients (54%). Patients with EGFR mutations had higher response rates to WBRT compared with those with the wild-type (54% versus 24%; P = 0.045). Both the administration of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (P = 0.034) and EGFR mutation (P = 0.029) were independently associated with response to WBRT. In Cox regression analysis, WBRT responder (P = 0.010) and absence of extracranial metastases (P = 0.002) were associated with better survival.CONCLUSIONS: Both the EGFR mutations and the administration of EGFR TKI during WBRT were independent predictors of response to WBRT in brain metastases of lung adenocarcinoma.",Excluded
2348,Accurate localization of optic radiation during neurosurgery in an interventional MRI suite. Accurate localization of the optic radiation is key to improving the surgical outcome for patients undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection for the treatment of refractory focal epilepsy. Current commercial interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are capable of performing anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging and are used for guidance during various neurosurgical procedures. We present an interventional imaging workflow that can accurately localize the optic radiation during surgery. The workflow is driven by a near real-time multichannel nonrigid image registration algorithm that uses both anatomical and fractional anisotropy pre- and intra-operative images. The proposed workflow is implemented on graphical processing units and we perform a warping of the pre-operatively parcellated optic radiation to the intra-operative space in under 3 min making the proposed algorithm suitable for use under the stringent time constraints of neurosurgical procedures. The method was validated using both a numerical phantom and clinical data using pre- and post-operative images from patients who had undergone surgery for treatment of refractory focal epilepsy and shows strong correlation between the observed post-operative visual field deficit and the predicted damage to the optic radiation. We also validate the algorithm using interventional MRI datasets from a small cohort of patients. This work could be of significant utility in image guided interventions and facilitate effective surgical treatments.,Excluded
3310,"Computational models of transcranial direct current stimulation. During transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), controllable dose parameters are electrode number (typically 1 anode and 1 cathode), position, size, shape, and applied electric current. Because different electrode montages result in distinct brain current flow patterns across the brain, tDCS dose parameters can be adjusted, in an application-specific manner, to target or avoid specific brain regions. Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability ""under"" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications. In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered. Finally, computational models can be used to design new electrode montages, for example, to improve spatial targeting such as high-definition tDCS. Pending further validation and dissemination of modeling tools, computational forward models of neuromodulation will become standard tools to guide the optimization of clinical trials and electrotherapy.",Excluded

Heavy metals attract a great deal of attention nowadays due to their potential accumulation in living creatures and transference in the food chain. Sediments of water reservoirs are considered to be a source of accumulation of these metals that develop in response to human activities and soil erosion. This study collected 180 samples of the surface sediments of water reservoir 1 at Chahnimeh in Sistan. Efficiency of the ANFIS model was evaluated to estimate the five bonds following the measurement of parameters in the laboratory. The following results were obtained for the parameters: organic carbon (OC) %, 0.31; cation exchange capacity (CEC), 37.07 Cmol kg; total Pb, 25.19 mg/kg; clay %, 45.87; and silt %, 39.02. These parameters were used as input for the training model. In the output layer, lead bonds were chosen as modeling targets in the following way: Pb f1 (4.61); Pb f2 (0.54); Pb f3 (16.28); Pb f4 (3.42); and Pb f5 (0.38) mg/kg. The best input compound in this model was chosen using the gamma test. From a total of 180, 88 data were considered for the model training section.

Here, we attempt to generate BTSC RNA-loaded DC vaccination as a novel GBM immunotherapy. Design/Methods: Patients with first supratentorial GBM recurrence >8 weeks after radiation underwent resection followed by leukapheresis to generate CD133+ BTSC RNA-loaded DCs. If BTSC RNA could not be sufficiently obtained, total tumor RNA (ttRNA) was used. The first 3 vaccines were administered at weekly intervals. An escalating total dose of mRNA-loaded DCs (2x10<sup>6</sup>, 5x10<sup>6</sup>, and 2x10<sup>7</sup> per vaccination) was evaluated to establish a MTD and DLT. Subsequent vaccines were given monthly until progression.

201,"Co-aggregation of ganglioside-containing membranes and alpha-synuclein. Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by the formation of Lewy bodies, whose main components are fibrils of the protein alpha-synuclein. These aggregates include membrane lipids, while little is known about the process of lipid/alpha- synuclein co-aggregation and its implications for fibril and Lewy body formation. Ganglioside lipids are abundant in neuronal membranes and have been found to accelerate fibril formation [1] and to accumulate in PD brains. We address the effects of ganglioside-phospholipid (GM3-POPC) model membranes on the dynamics (regarding the order parameter and the correlation time of C-H bond reorientation) and structure of co-aggregates with alpha-synuclein using polarization-transfer 13C solid-state NMR [2], wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and cryogenic electron microscopy. 31P NMR powder patterns were recorded to monitor the lipid phase behavior and the spinning sidebands at 1250 Hz MAS were used to fit the chemical shift anisotropy before and after coaggregation. It was found that both lipids are co-assembled with alpha-synuclein with reduced headgroup and acyl chain mobility, and that the mobility of alpha-synuclein is modulated by the lipid-to-protein ratio and membrane composition. As the ganglioside content of membranes was increased the mobility of alanine residues is affected, implying a modulation of the fibril core which could impact the fibrillation propensity. These effects of co-aggregation on alpha-synuclein fibril mobility are currently being further investigated by us and raises questions on the specific lipid-protein interactions and the organization of lipids inside coaggregates.",Excluded

992,"Annual rate of hearing loss falls after fractionated stereotactic irradiation for vestibular schwannoma. PURPOSE: The rate of hearing loss in a population before and after irradiation was investigated to determine the effect of irradiation on hearing impairment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 72 patients with vestibular schwannoma who received fractionated stereotactic irradiation from 1992 to 1999, 21 had had their hearing levels examined 3 months or more before the treatment. The mean time between the initial examination and treatment was 18.6 months (range: 3-89 months), and the mean time between treatment and the last follow-up was 24.2 months (12-69 months). Thirty-six to 50 Gy in 20-25 fractions over 5 to 6 weeks was given using an X-ray beam from a linear accelerator. Pure tone average (PTA) was measured using the mean hearing level at five frequencies, and the annual rate of hearing loss was defined as [(hearing loss in PTA(dB))/(follow-up period (months)x12)].RESULTS: The actual cumulative curve of decrease in tumor size of 2 mm or more was 38.3% at 2 years and 80.0% at 3 years. The mean of hearing loss in PTA was 11.6+/-10.3 dB (-1 to 35 dB) from the initial examination to the start of irradiation and 11.9+/-14.4 dB (-14 to 37 dB) from the start of irradiation to the last follow-up. The mean annual rates of hearing loss before irradiation and in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th years after irradiation were, respectively, 18.6, 11.2, 6.2, 5.1, and 5.0 dB/year. The annual rates of hearing loss in the 2nd year (P=0.025) and 3rd year (P=0.018) were significantly slower than the rate before irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: The mean annual rate of hearing loss was higher before irradiation than after irradiation, and hearing loss slowed rather than accelerated after irradiation. Although hearing loss after the treatment was usually permanent, fractionated stereotactic irradiation was suggested to be effective to lower the rate of hearing loss.",Excluded

1976,"Re-irradiation of adenoid cystic carcinoma: analysis and evaluation of outcome in 52 consecutive patients treated with raster-scanned carbon ion therapy. BACKGROUND: Treatment of local relapse in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) following prior radiation remains a challenge: without the possibility of surgical salvage patients face the choice between palliative chemotherapy and re-irradiation. Chemotherapy yields response rates around 30% and application of tumouricidal doses is difficult due to proximity of critical structures. Carbon ion therapy (C12) is a promising method to minimize side-effects and maximize re-treatment dose in this indication. We describe our initial results for re-irradiation in heavily pre-treated ACC patients.METHODS: Patients treated with carbon ion therapy between 04/2010 and 05/2013 (N=52pts, median age: 54 a) were retrospectively evaluated regarding toxicity (NCI CTC v.4), tumour response (RECIST) and control rates. 48pts (92.3%) received carbon ions only, 4pts received IMRT plus C12.RESULTS: 4pts were treated following R1-resection, 43pts for inoperable local relapse. Most common tumour sites were paranasal sinus (36.5%), parotid (19.2%), and base of skull (17.3%). Pts received a median dose of 51GyE C12/63Gy BED and cumulative dose of 128Gy BED [67-182Gy] after a median RT-interval of 61months. Median target volume was 93ml [9-618ml]. No higher-grade (>degreeII) acute reactions were observed, 7pts showed blood-brain-barrier changes (degreeI/II: 8pts; degreeIII: 2pts), 1 pt corneal ulceration, xerophthalmia 7pts, degreeIV bleeding 1 pt, tissue necrosis 2pts, otherwise no significant late reactions. Objective response rate (CR/PR) was 56.6%. With a median follow-up of 14months [1-39months] local control and distant control at 1a are 70.3% and 72.6% respectively. Of the 18pts with local relapse, 13pts have recurred in-field, 1 pt at the field edge, 3pts out of field, and one in the dose gradient.CONCLUSION: Despite high applied doses, C12 re-irradiation shows moderate side-effects, response rates even in these heavily pre-treated patients are encouraging and present a good alternative to palliative chemotherapy. Though most local recurrences occur within the high-dose area, further dose escalation should be viewed with caution.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To describe the history, clinical findings, and possible etiologies of ophthalmic findings discovered in 7 astronauts after long-duration space flight, and document vision changes in approximately 300 additional astronauts.DESIGN: Retrospective, observational examination of ophthalmic findings in 7 astronauts and analysis of postflight questionnaires regarding in-flight vision changes in approximately 300 additional astronauts.PARTICIPANTS: Seven astronauts with ophthalmic anomalies upon return from long-duration space missions to the International Space Station and 300 additional astronauts who completed postflight questionnaires regarding in-flight vision changes.METHODS: Before and after long-duration space flight, all 7 subjects underwent complete eye examinations, including cycloplegic and/or manifest refraction and fundus photography. Six underwent postmission optical coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 4 had lumbar punctures (LP). Approximately 300 astronauts were queried regarding visual changes during space missions.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refractive change, fundus photograph examination, retina OCT, orbital MRI, LP opening pressures, and examination of visual acuity data.RESULTS: After 6 months of space flight, 7 astronauts had ophthalmic findings, consisting of disc edema in 5, globe flattening in 5, choroidal folds in 5, cotton wool spots (CWS) in 3, nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT in 6, and decreased near vision in 6 astronauts. Five of 7 with near vision complaints had a hyperopic shift >=+0.50 diopters (D) between pre/postmission spherical equivalent refraction in 1 or both eyes (range, +0.50 to +1.75 D). These 5 showed globe flattening on MRI. Lumbar punctures performed in the 4 with disc edema documented opening pressures of 22, 21, 28, and 28.5 cm H(2)O performed 60, 19, 12, and 57 days postmission, respectively. The 300 postflight questionnaires documented that approximately 29% and 60% of astronauts on short and long-duration missions, respectively, experienced a degradation in distant and near visual acuity. Some of these vision changes remain unresolved years after flight.CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the optic nerve and ocular changes we describe may result from cephalad fluid shifts brought about by prolonged microgravity exposure.

The purpose of this article is to present the imaging appearance of central nervous system effects of therapy that may occur in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Imaging in these patients relates to complications of high-dose therapy, bone marrow transplantation, infections occurring in immunocompromised patients, central nervous system dysfunction due to failure of other organ systems, or cerebral hemorrhages due to platelet refractoriness. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential but often difficult, as neurological manifestations are rarely disease specific.

Objective: To determine the clinical and radiologic outcome of patients with acoustic neuroma (AN) treated with linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife-based stereotactic radiosurgery with respect to tumor control, preservation of serviceable hearing, and toxicity. Method(s): A retrospective monocentric analysis including all patients who underwent single-fraction LINAC- or CyberKnife-based radiosurgery for AN between 1991 and 2015. Patient data were analyzed in terms of radiologic and clinical tumor control (no further intervention needed), treatment-related complications, preservation of serviceable hearing, and objectified hearing loss using pure tone average levels. Result(s): We included 335 patients (median age 58.2 years, treated either by LINAC-based [n = 270] or CyberKnife [n = 65] stereotactic radiosurgery). The median tumor volume was 1.1 mL (0.1-23.7 mL). The median radiation dose was 12 Gy (LINAC 12 Gy, 11-20 Gy; CyberKnife 13 Gy, 12-13 Gy) at an isodose level of 71.7% (LINAC 68.3%, 31.9%-86.2%; CyberKnife 80%, 65%-81%). The median follow-up was 30 months (LINAC 43 months, 2-224 months; CyberKnife 13 months, 4-37 months). Clinical tumor control was 98%, 89%, and 88% at 2, 5, and 10 years. The objective actuarial hearing preservation rate was 89%, 80%, and 55% at 1, 2, and 5 years. New symptoms were observed in 11.3% and classified as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1/2, apart from 4 patients (1.2%), who developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3.

2296,"Focal brain lesions induced with ultraviolet irradiation. Lesion and inactivation methods have played important roles in neuroscience studies. However, traditional techniques for creating a brain lesion are highly invasive, and control of lesion size and shape using these techniques is not easy. Here, we developed a novel method for creating a lesion on the cortical surface via 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation without breaking the dura mater. We demonstrated that 2.0 mWh UV irradiation, but not the same amount of non-UV light irradiation, induced an inverted bell-shaped lesion with neuronal loss and accumulation of glial cells. Moreover, the volume of the UV irradiation-induced lesion depended on the UV light exposure amount. We further succeeded in visualizing the lesioned site in a living animal using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Importantly, we also observed using an optical imaging technique that the spread of neural activation evoked by adjacent cortical stimulation disappeared only at the UV-irradiated site. In summary, UV irradiation can induce a focal brain lesion with a stable shape and size in a less invasive manner than traditional lesioning methods. This method is applicable to not only neuroscientific lesion experiments but also studies of the focal brain injury recovery process.",Excluded

The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers. There was no evidence of blood brain barrier leakage. These studies show that the rabbit eye can be affected by microwave radiation at intensities lower than previously reported.",Excluded

2107,"Differentiating embryonic stem-derived neural stem cells show a maturation-dependent pattern of voltage-gated sodium current expression and graded action potentials. A population of mouse embryonic stem (ES)-derived neural stem cells (named NS cells) that exhibits traits reminiscent of radial glia-like cell population and that can be homogeneously expanded in monolayer while remaining stable and highly neurogenic over multiple passages has been recently discovered. This novel population has provided a unique in vitro system in which to investigate physiological events occurring as stem cells lose multipotency and terminally differentiate. Here we analysed the timing, quality and quantity of the appearance of the excitability properties of differentiating NS cells which have been long-term expanded in vitro. To this end, we studied the biophysical properties of voltage-dependent Na(+) currents as an electrophysiological readout for neuronal maturation stages of differentiating NS cells toward the generation of fully functional neurons, since the expression of neuronal voltage-gated Na(+) channels is an essential hallmark of neuronal differentiation and crucial for signal transmission in the nervous system. Using the whole cell and single-channel cell-attached variations of the patch-clamp technique we found that the Na(+) currents in NS cells showed substantial electrophysiological changes during in vitro neuronal differentiation, consisting mainly in an increase of Na(+) current density and in a shift of the steady-state activation and inactivation curves toward more negative and more positive potentials respectively. The changes in the Na(+) channel system were closely related with the ability of differentiating NS cells to generate action potentials, and could therefore be exploited as an appropriate electrophysiological marker of ES-derived NS cells undergoing functional neuronal maturation.",Excluded

Background: Metastatic deposits to the spine in thyroid cancer patients represent the most common site of bone involvement and can contribute to pain, neurologic deficits, and death. This study sought to determine the efficacy and safety of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) for thyroid cancer patients. Method(s): Thyroid cancer patients with spine metastases were selected and analyzed from a cohort of patients who were prospectively enrolled in two single-institution Phase I/II studies. SSRS was delivered in single or multi-fraction schedules. Dose regimens ranged from 16-18 Gy in one fraction to 27-30 Gy in three to five fractions. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI-CTC toxicity scale. Local control was determined by serial post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans showing no evidence of progressive disease. Patients were followed until date of death or date of last known visit for survival analyses. Local control and overall survival rates were carried out using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The log-rank test was used to assess the equality of the survivor function across groups. A p-value of <=0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 27 spine lesions were treated in 23 patients over a six-year period. Median follow-up was 28.9 months (range 5-93 months). Local control was 88% at two years and 79% at three years. In patients with progressive disease following conventional radiation therapy, local control for salvage SSRS remained at 88% at three years. Patients requiring upfront surgical intervention and treated with adjuvant SSRS achieved sustained control rates of 86% at three years. Overall survival rates were 85% and 67% at one and two years, respectively. In patients classified with oligoprogression and controlled extra-spinal disease, overall survival was significantly higher than those with evidence of systemic progression (81% vs. 45% at two years; p = 0.01). Univariate analysis did not show significant correlations between local control and age, systemic disease status, prior <sup>131</sup>I therapy, SSRS fraction regimen, spine location, histological subtype, or time from initial diagnosis to evidence of spinal metastasis. No patient experienced any grade 3-5 toxicity. Pain flare was reported in 30% of patients, with only three patients (13%) requiring narcotics or short-course steroids. There was no evidence of vertebral body fracture in any patient that achieved local control in the treated area. Conclusion(s): SSRS for thyroid metastases as a primary or adjuvant/salvage therapy is well tolerated and yields high rates of local control.

AIM: To investigate the effects of glutamate microinjection into hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats and to explore the relevant mechanisms.METHODS: 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (100 mg/kg in 50% ethanol) was instilled into the colon of adult male SD rats to induce UC. A colonic damage score (CDS) was used to indicate the severity of the colonic mucosal damage. The pathological changes in the colonic mucosa were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, biochemical analyses or ELISA. Ten minutes before UC induction, drugs were microinjected into the relevant nuclei in rat brain to produce chemical stimulation or chemical lesion.RESULTS: Microinjection of glutamate (3, 6 and 12 mug) into the PVN dose-dependently decreased the CDS in UC rats. This protective effect was eliminated after kainic acid (0.3 mug) was microinjected into PVN or into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that caused chemical lesion of these nuclei. This protective effect was also prevented when the AVP-V1 receptor antagonist DPVDAV (200 ng) was microinjected into the NTS. The discharge frequency of the vagus was markedly decreased following microinjection of glutamate into the PVN. Microinjection of glutamate into the PVN in UC rats significantly increased the cell proliferation and anti-oxidant levels, and decreased the apoptosis and Bax and caspase 3 expression levels and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors in the colonic mucosa.CONCLUSION: The activation of hypothalamic PVN exerts protective effects against UC, which is mediated by the NTS and vagus.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Permanent night-shift workers may develop shift-work disorder (SWD). In the current study, we evaluated neurophysiological and behavioral indices of distractibility across times prior to the night shift (T1), during night hours (T2), and after acute sleep deprivation (T3) in permanent hospital night workers with and without SWD.METHODS: Ten asymptomatic night workers (NW) and 18 NW with SWD participated in a 25-h sleep deprivation study. Circadian phase was evaluated by dim-light salivary melatonin onset (DLMO). Objective sleepiness was evaluated using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Electrophysiological distractibility was evaluated by brain event-related potentials (ERP), whereas behavioral distractibility was evaluated by performance on a visual task in an auditory-visual distraction paradigm.STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Comparisons of ERP results were performed by repeated-measures analysis of variance, and t-tests were used where appropriate. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of variables (MLST, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and DLMO) that deviated from normal.RESULTS: First, in the SWD group, the reorienting negativity ERP amplitude was significantly attenuated compared to that in the NW group. Second, the SWD group had shorter MSLT during night shift hours (4.8 +/- 4.9 min) compared to that in NW (7.8 +/- 3.7 min; U = 47; z = -2.1; P < 0.03). Third, NW with SWD had a DLMO at 20:27 +/- 5.0 h, whereas healthy NW had a DLMO at 05:00 +/- 3.4 h (U = 43.5; z = -2.22, P < 0.03).

454,"Effect of short-duration spaceflight on thigh and leg muscle volume. PURPOSE: Human skeletal muscle probably atrophies as a result of spaceflight, but few studies have examined this issue. Thus, little is known about the influence of microgravity upon human skeletal muscle, nor is it possible to assess the validity of ground based models of spaceflight. This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of spaceflight induced muscle atrophy would be a function of flight duration and greater than that of bed rest.METHODS: Three astronauts flew 9, 15, and 16 d in space. Volume of the knee extensor (quadriceps femoris), knee flexor (hamstrings, sartorius, and gracilis), and plantar flexor (triceps surae) muscle groups was measured using magnetic resonance imaging before and after spaceflight and during recovery. The volume of each muscle group in each image was determined by multiplying cross-sectional area by slice thickness. These values were subsequently summed to calculate muscle volume.RESULTS: Volume changes in the knee extensor, knee flexor, and plantar flexor muscle groups ranged from -15.4 to -5.5, -14.1 to -5.6, and -8.8 to -15.9%, respectively. Muscle volume decreases normalized by flight duration ranged from 0.62 to 1.04% x d(-1). These relative changes appeared to be greater than those that we have reported previously for bed rest (Akima et al., J. Gravitat.

PURPOSE: To investigate the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in patients with head-and-neck cancer and treated with radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, the relationship among SNHL and radiation dose to the cochlea, the use of two common cisplatin dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 62 head-and-neck cancer patients treated with curative intent were included in this prospective study. Of the patients, 21 received RT alone, 27 received 40 mg/m(2) weekly cisplatin, 13 received 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks during RT, and 1 received RT with weekly epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor antibody. The effect of chemotherapy and RT dose on hearing was determined using a model that accounted for the age and variability between each ear for each patient.RESULTS: We constructed a model to predict dose-dependent hearing loss for RT or cisplatin-based chemotherapy either alone or in combination. For patients only receiving RT, no significant hearing loss was found at doses to the cochlea of less than 40 Gy. Patients receiving 100 mg/m(2) or 40 mg/m(2) of cisplatin chemotherapy had an estimated +21.5 dB and +9.5 dB hearing loss at 8,000 Hz with low radiation doses (10 Gy), which rose to +38.4 dB and +18.9 dB for high radiation doses (40 Gy).CONCLUSIONS: Use of RT alone with doses of less than 40 Gy did not result in clinically significant hearing loss. High-frequency SNHL was profoundly damaged in patients who received concomitant cisplatin when doses of 100 mg/m(2) were used. The threshold cochlear dose for hearing loss with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and RT was predicted to be 10 Gy. The inner ear radiation dose constraints and cisplatin dose intensity should be considered in the treatment of advanced head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded

697,"MR neuroimaging of HIV infected patients: A pictorial review. The incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is low in Australia, but these patients can present with unusual infections and imaging abnormalities. We review several common CNS pathologies that affect the HIV infected patients and discuss their MR imaging features. Our hospital provides a dedicated service to this small group of patients for the state. MR imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of CNS manifestation of HIV infection. The spectrum of disease can be categorised into 4 groups: 1. Direct consequence of HIV virus: HIV encephalitis - HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) - AIDS dementia complex. 2. Opportunistic infections including toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), tuberculosis, cryptococcosis and cytomegalovirus infection. 3. Neoplasm predominantly due to CNS lymphoma. 4. Consequence of HIV treatment: Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to antiviral treatment. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): It is important for radiologists to recognise HIV related conditions and their imaging features to help with patient management, both in the community and in the hospital setting.",Excluded
3331,"Deep brain stimulation reduces neuronal entropy in the MPTP-primate model of Parkinson's disease. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal segment of the globus pallidus is a clinically successful treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms by which HFS alleviates these symptoms are not understood. Whereas initial studies focused on HFS-induced changes in neuronal firing rates, recent studies suggest that changes in patterns of neuronal activity may correlate with symptom alleviation. We hypothesized that effective STN HFS reduces the disorder of neuronal firing patterns in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit, minimizing the pathological activity associated with parkinsonism. Stimulating leads were implanted in the STN of two rhesus monkeys rendered parkinsonian by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Action potentials were recorded from neurons of the internal and external globus pallidus and the motor thalamus (ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis pars oralis, and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis) during HFS that reduced motor symptoms and during clinically ineffective low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Firing pattern entropy was calculated from the recorded spike times to quantify the disorder of the neuronal activity. The firing pattern entropy of neurons within each region of the pallidum and motor thalamus decreased in response to HFS (n > or = 18 and P < or = 0.02 in each region), whereas firing rate changes were specific to pallidal neurons only. In response to LFS, firing rates were unchanged, but firing pattern entropy increased throughout the circuit (n > or = 24 and P < or = 10(-4) in each region). These data suggest that the clinical effectiveness of HFS is correlated with, and potentially mediated by, a regularization of the pattern of neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia thalamic circuit.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PC) and the risk of developing stroke and thromboembolic events. Our study evaluated the association between ADT use and development of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in a homogenous group of men with PC treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) after controlling for multiple sources of confounding.METHODS: Observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with PC at the US Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 January 2001 and October 31, 2015 and treated with definitive RT. Exposure was initiation of ADT within 1 year of PC diagnosis. Primary outcomes were development of stroke, TIA, DVT, or PE.RESULTS: 44,246 men with median follow-up of 6.8 years. The overall cumulative incidences of stroke, TIA, DVT, and PE at 10 years were 6.0, 3.0, 3.4, and 1.9%, respectively. In the multivariable competing risks model, there was a significant association between ADT and stroke (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09-1.30, p < 0.01), TIA (SHR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.41, p < 0.01), and DVT (SHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04-1.34, p < 0.01). ADT was only associated with PE in men receiving ADT for > 1 year (SHR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.06-1.69, p-value = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in the risk of stroke, TIA, and DVT in men receiving ADT and an increased risk of PE in men receiving long-term ADT. These results highlight concerns regarding long-term risks of ADT on stroke and thromboembolic events in the treatment of PC.",Excluded
1424,"Use of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to measure radiation-induced chromosome damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines. To establish the optimal experimental conditions for the use of the micronuclei (MN) test to determine the level of chromosomal damage induced by ionising radiation (IR) exposure in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a time-course study was performed comparing a normal and an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, the latter being characterised by an extreme radiation sensitivity. Several parameters were analysed: the use of cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) to quantify MN, the optimum fixation time to measure radiation-induced MN, the most appropriate treatment dose of IR to distinguish between the normal and the radiosensitive cells and the cell-cycle distribution after irradiation. The results obtained showed that the spontaneous as well as the radiation-induced levels of MN were significantly higher in the AT cell compared to the normal cells (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In both cell types the number of radiation-induced MN were lower in the cultures without Cyt-B than those with Cyt-B (P < 0.001), with the AT cells being distinguished in terms of IR-induced MN from the normal cells only with the addition of Cyt-B. The level of MN formation was independent of the dose of Cyt-B used (3 or 6 microg/ml). The optimum time for radiation-induced MN measured was found to be between 48 and 72 h post-irradiation, with 2 and 4 Gy exposures inducing similar levels of MN. However, as the higher dose caused a greater delay in the cell-cycle, treatment with 2 Gy with MN measurement at 48 h in the presence of 3 microg/ml Cyt-B were chosen as the optimum experimental conditions. This choice was validated using two additional normal and AT cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that the use of Cyt-B increases the sensitivity of the MN test for comparing differences in radiosensitivity between lymphoblastoid cell lines.",Excluded
739,"Epidemiology and molecular pathology of glioma. Gliomas account for almost 80% of primary malignant brain tumors, and they result in more years of life lost than do any other tumors. Glioblastoma, the most common type of glioma, is associated with very poor survival, so glioma epidemiology has focused on identifying factors that can be modified to prevent this disease. Only two relatively rare factors have so far been conclusively shown to affect glioma risk--exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, and inherited mutations of highly penetrant genes associated with rare syndromes. In addition, preliminary evidence points to a lower glioma risk among people with allergic conditions and high levels of serum IgE. Recent research has focused on identifying germline polymorphisms associated with risk of glioma, and using molecular markers to classify glial tumors into more-homogenous groups. Because gene products probably interact with environmental factors or developmental signals to produce gliomas, large studies are needed to analyze associations between polymorphisms and glioma. Cohort studies of immune factors and glioma risk are being undertaken to validate the results of case-control studies. Studies of polymorphisms of genetic pathways with strong prior hypotheses are being planned, and whole-genome scans are being proposed to study high-risk families and case-control series.

1400,"Radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas. Background: Radiosurgery has been established as an important alternative to microsurgery. We report our experience with radiosurgery for tumor control and the complications of unilateral vestibular schwannomas. Method(s): We reviewed our early experience regarding clinical presentation, management and outcomes in 45 patients with acoustic schwannomas who underwent gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery. The median follow-up period was 25 months (range, 6-48 months). Thirteen patients had undergone 1 or more previous resections before radiosurgery; 32 underwent radiosurgery as the first procedure. Median tumor volume was 4.5 mL (range, 0.5-30.0), and median radiotherapy dose was 11.5 Gy (range, 10.5-14.0 Gy). Result(s): Tumor control was achieved in 43 patients (95.6%). Loss of central contrast enhancement was a characteristic change and was noted in 29 patients (64.4%). Reduction in tumor size was shown in 15 patients (33.3%). Thirteen patients (28.9%) had good or serviceable hearing preoperatively, and in all of these, the preoperative status was retained immediately after radiosurgery. At follow-up, however, 10 patients (76.9%) had preserved hearing and 3 (23.1%) had reduced hearing on the treated side. Hearing in 1 patient that was not serviceable preoperatively later improved to a serviceable level. No patients had delayed facial palsy or lower cranial nerve dysfunction, but one had delayed trigeminal sensory loss. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery achieved a high tumor control rate and a relatively low post-radiosurgical complication rate for acoustic neuromas. Â© 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2365,"New considerations in radiation treatment planning for brain tumors: neural progenitor cell-containing niches. The purpose of this critical review is to explore the controversy regarding the relationship between radiation dose to the neural progenitor cell (NPC) niches and patient outcomes, in terms of both toxicity and tumor control. NPCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus are paradoxically associated with long-term neurocognitive sequelae of brain irradiation, as well as resistance to therapy and tumor recurrence. The reconciliation of these somewhat opposing functions is challenging. Current literature suggests that radiation and other treatments against the NPC in the hippocampus and the SVZ may influence patient outcome. As a result, both the SVZ and the hippocampus could have important implications on radiation treatment planning strategies, and future laboratory and clinical evaluations will be critical in designing studies to optimize treatment outcome, effectiveness, and safety.",Excluded
2748,"Formulation optimization of smart thermosetting lamotrigine loaded hydrogels using response surface methodology, box benhken design and artificial neural networks. The aim of this research was to develop lamotrigine containing thermosetting hydrogel for intranasal administration to manage and treat generalized epilepsy. Thermosetting hydrogels were prepared using different ratios of poloxamer 407 (L127), poloxamer 188 (L68) and Carbopol<sup></sup> 974 P NF (C974) using the cold production process. The in situ thermosetting hydrogel was optimized using Box Behken design. Co-solvency approach was used to increase the solubility of lamotrigine by dissolving it in propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol 400 (0.2: 0.8) and the resultant solution was incorporated in the hydrogel to manufacture an LTG hydrogel. The presence of a higher amount of L127 resulted in higher viscosity at 22 degreeC and 34 degreeC and decreased the overall release of LTG. An increase in the amount of C974 resulted in a decrease in the pH of the hydrogel. The results show that formulations F10, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16 and F17 exhibited acceptable thermosetting behavior, pH and released adequate Lamotrigine above the minimum effective concentration to treat generalized epilepsy. The optimized formulation exhibited acceptable thermosetting behavior, pH and lamotrigine release but formed a stiff gel at 22 degreeC. The average LTG content of the optimized hydrogel was 5.00 +/- 0.0225 mg/ml with % recovery of 99.17%. The amount of LTG released at 12 h from the optimized hydrogel was 3.21 +/- 0.0155 mg and will be therapeutically effective in the brain after absorption via the olfactory region in the nasal cavity.

Objective: The pathophysiological mechanisms behind idiopathic fecal incontinence (IFI) is still partially unknown, however abnormalities within the central nervous system (CNS) have been proposed as part of the pathogenesis. The current study aimed to examine gray matter volume and cortical thickness characteristics as well as white matter (WM) tract characteristics in patients with IFI and healthy controls. Method(s): We enrolled 21 female patients with IFI (60.3+/-10.9 years) and 15 healthy controls (55.5+/-9.45 years). All subjects underwent a structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We performed voxel-based morphometry analysis to investigate grey matter volume and surface-based morphometry analysis investigate cortical thickness. Additionally, we used tract-based-spatial statistics (TBSS) to characterize WM microstructure. Finally, associations between MRI based brain characteristics and previously collected latencies of rectal sensory evoked electroencephalography potentials were determined. Result(s): Compared to healthy controls, IFI patients had significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) values, implicating reduced integrity of fiber tracts, in the left hemisphere. Particularly in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) (P=.042), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) (P=.047), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (P=.049), see Figure 1. No differences were observed in gray matter volume or in cortical thickness between the groups. The reduced FA values in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and middle frontal gyrus were negatively associated with prolonged latencies of cortical potentials evoked by rectal stimuli (all P<.05). (Figure Presented) Conclusion(s): IFI patients have no macrostructural brain abnormalities, but reduced integrity of left WM tracts that are relevant for sensory processing when compared to healthy controls. The clinical relevance of the microstructural findings is supported by their associations with functional changes expressed as prolonged latencies of cortical potentials evoked by rectal stimulation.

The PEPs were recorded in PB, lateral hypothalamus (LH), and habenular complex (HC). In some rats the pineal stalk was lesioned either by electrolysis or by surgical means. Recordings were begun 3 days after electrode implantation; three recording sessions were performed before and after extirpation of SCG or lesion of pineal stalk. The PEPs recorded in LH and HC were characterized by 3 components (positive-negative-positive: PNP). The average latency of the first wave was 35.3 +/- 1.7 and 38.8 +/- 1.6 ms for LH and HC, respectively. The peaks of PEPs in PB showed different polarity (NPN), and the first component had a latency of 36.1 +/- 1.2 ms. The PEPs persisted in all three structures after extirpation of SCG and after electrolytic lesion or transection of the pineal stalk. These results show that the PEPs recorded in PB are not generated in this structure, since they persist after interrupting its connections with the rest of the central nervous system; this suggests that PEPs could be the result of electrotonic transmission from neighboring structures.",Excluded

This paper describes major additions to the modeling and simulation capabilities of the Accident Dynamic Simulator paired with the Information, Decision, and Action in a Crew context (ADS-IDAC), a platform for conducting dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (DPRA) of nuclear power plants. The new advancements are mostly in modeling of operator knowledge-based behavior in accident conditions, enhancing realism of the IDAC model, and simulation approach to Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). The focus is situation assessment and diagnosis of the accident cause. Knowledge-based reasoning plays an important role in this phase. A reasoning module has been developed and implemented in ADS-IDAC to simulate operators' knowledge-based reasoning. This paper describes the cognitive architecture of the reasoning module, including knowledge representation (model of operator's understanding of the plant systems and functions), a memory representation, information processing flow, reasoning sequence generation, and rules for accident diagnosis. Some theoretical and empirical insights for human error prediction are embedded in this causal model as simulation rules. Human cognitive limitations and heuristics that potentially contribute to human errors are explicitly modeled. Together with the model description, several example simulations are provided to demonstrate different features of the reasoning module. Examples of the simulation show that the reasoning module in ADS-IDAC produces realistic knowledge-based responses by capturing cognitive limitations, deliberative reasoning, and dynamic of accident progression.

Thoracic radiotherapy has been shown in to increase overall survival when added to systemic therapy in patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and M0 stage. The dose, fractionation, treatment time and timing issues have not been fully resolved. A recent study did not show the superiority of 66Gy in 33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks over twice-daily radiotherapy to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks twice daily [1]. For stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has been clearly shown to be superior to conventional fractionation [2]. Given the clear benefit seen in early stage NSCLC, it is postulated that SABR may have a role to play in early stage SCLC. A recent multi-institutional cohort study has reported favourable outcomes in this setting [3]. However, randomised data of equivalence or indeed superiority are lacking. Furthermore, questions remain as the timing and role of systemic therapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation when SABR is used in this setting. In advanced SCLC, many tumors display neuroendocrine clinical and cytological features and many SCLC tumors express somatostatin receptor and this can be imaged using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE [4]. Given the uptake by some SCLC tumors of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE, higher doses of the tracer have been used in an attempt to provide radiolabelled radiotherapy treatment in metastatic disease in what has been described as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) [5]. This molecularly target radiotherapy is a potentially exciting therapeutic approach, but the ideal positioning of such therapy in tumors which are suitable for treatment with PRRT and the safety of PRRT with systemic therapy have yet to be determined.

OBJECTIVE(S): We assessed the relationship between patient and tumor characteristics, treatment, and overall survival (OS). METHOD(S):We conducted a retrospective review of 196 patients who received brain radiation for BCBMbetween 2009-2013 at Mayo Clinic. Primary tumor characteristics were collected, including simplified molecular subtype. Other characteristics included patient's ECOG, number of brain lesions at BCBM diagnosis, and treatment received, including neurosurgery, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The primary endpoint was OS from time of BCBM diagnosis. RESULT(S): Single-variable analysis revealed patients with HER2+ breast cancer had improved OS (HR = 0:6, p = 0:008). Compared to patients with 1-3 brain lesions, the risk of death in patients with leptomeningeal disease was 2.5-fold higher (p = 0:003). Worsening ECOG status was associated with worsening OS.

1556,"Photopigment self-screening and the determination of macular pigment absorbance using heterochromatic flicker photometry. PURPOSE: Heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP) is commonly used to determine macular pigment optical density (MPOD). Since HFP in this application is a locus comparison method, an identical relative spectral response at each locus is required for a perfect measure. We know this requirement cannot be strictly true since the optical density of photopigments increases as the foveal center is approached. Thus, the self-screening effect would result in an underestimate of MPOD. An earlier study concluded that the underestimate is on the order of 30%. We examined this issue by manipulating photopigment optical density, and consequently the degree of selfscreening.METHODS: A continuously exposed, 470 nm, background bleached cone photopigments over a range from 0 to 80%. MPOD was determined 10' and 30' from the foveal center. Two subjects were used in the main experiment. Five additional subjects were studied with just the 0% and 80% bleach levels. Spectral measures were obtained at 0% and 70% bleach levels for the two primary subjects.RESULTS: Subjects in the main experiment showed MPOD estimates that increased with increasing bleaching. The effect, however, was small: one observer's MPOD increased 0.08 and 0.02 for the 10' and 30' loci, respectively; the other observer's values were 0.04 and 0.01 for the same loci. Comparable values were obtained for the other five subjects using the 0% and 80% bleach conditions. Spectral measures were consistent with the findings of the main experiment.CONCLUSIONS: When self-screening is nearly abolished (80% bleach), a relatively small underestimation is revealed for the unbleached state. For the 1degree target we show about 2-3% underestimation. Our 20' target reveals a larger underestimate (8-9%), consistent with longer photoreceptor outer-segments nearer the foveal center. We conclude that HFP yields values essentially independent of self-screening for targets of 1degree diameter or greater. Smaller targets are less than 10% underestimated for near-zero bleach conditions.",Excluded

We have examined material from normal individuals, from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and from A-T heterozygotes. We have confirmed the greater sensitivity of A-T derived cells to gamma radiation. The distinction between A-T and normal cells is maintained in cells immortalized by SV40 virus but the immortal cells are more gamma radiation resistant than the corresponding primary fibroblasts. Cells transformed by plasmids (pSV3gpt and pSV3neo) expressing SV40 T-antigen, both pre- and post-crisis, show this increased resistance, indicating that it is expression of SV40 T-antigen, rather than immortalization per se which is responsible for the change.

2643,"Patient perceptions of computed tomographic imaging and their understanding of radiation risk and exposure. STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe patient perceptions of computed tomography (CT) and their understanding of radiation exposure and risk.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of acute abdominal pain patients aged 18 years or older. Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: ""Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed.RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record.CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.",Excluded
1402,"Light-induced Egr-1 expression in the striate cortex of the opossum. In the present study, immunocytochemistry was used to assess the expression of Egr-1 nuclear protein across selected regions of the opossum visual system. In light-deprived (LD) animals, only a few scattered cell nuclei were found throughout the striate cortex (V1). Exposure to light promoted a significant increase in the density of Egr-1 labeled nuclei in V1. Laminar distribution of immunoreactive nuclei in light-stimulated animals (LS) tended to vary with topography: the lateral region, which corresponds to the central representation of the visual field, appeared to have higher density of cells expressing protein in the supragranular layers, as compared to the medial region, which corresponds to the representation of the peripheral field of vision. Finally, LS animals displayed a narrow band of labeled cell nuclei in the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and throughout the anteroposterior extent of the superior colliculus (SC). In contrast, almost no Egr-1 immunolabeling was found in the IGL and SC of LD animals. Our report is the first demonstration of light-regulated expression of the Egr-1 gene in the opossum visual system and provides evidence that the expression of an activity-dependent gene related to neural plasticity is evolutionarily conserved in the visual cortex of the mammalian lineage.",Excluded
1840,"Thrombus imaging in acute ischaemic stroke using thin-slice unenhanced CT: comparison of conventional sequential CT and helical CT. OBJECTIVES: Thin-slice helical unenhanced CT can be used for thrombus imaging but increases radiation exposure. Conventional sequential images obtained by multidetector CT can be reconstructed into thin-slice images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if conventional sequential unenhanced CT images can replace helical unenhanced CT for thrombus imaging.METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke underwent both 5-mm conventional sequential unenhanced CT and helical unenhanced CT. Each of the sequential and helical unenhanced CT images was subsequently reconstructed into four 1.25-mm images. Thrombus volumes and HU were measured semi-automatically using both types of unenhanced CT. Thrombus HU ratio (rHU) was calculated using the HU of the contralateral segment. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess measurement agreement.RESULTS: The mean rHUs were 1.47 +/- 0.17 for sequential unenhanced CT and 1.47 +/- 0.18 helical unenhanced CT (P = 0.542). The mean thrombus volumes were 124.25 +/- 125.65 mm(3) and 117.84 +/- 124.32 mm(3) on sequential and helical unenhanced CT images, respectively (P = 0.063). Measurement agreement between thrombus volumes from the two unenhanced CT images was high (ICC = 0.981).CONCLUSIONS: Thin-slice unenhanced CT images reconstructed from 5-mm sequential images can replace helical unenhanced CT for thrombus imaging in acute ischaemic stroke.KEY POINTS : * Unenhanced CT is used to evaluate intra-arterial thrombus. * Thrombus HU and volume measurements using sequential or helical CT are comparable. * Conventional sequential images can replace helical CT for thrombus imaging. * Radiation dose for thrombus imaging can be reduced using sequential CT.",Excluded
387,"Feasibility and clinical tolerability of the extendTM relocatable head frame for perfexionTM intra-cranial stereotactic radiotherapy. Purpose: This study aims to identify the challenges in clinical use of the EXTENDTM relocatable head frame (RHF) and to qualitatively report the patient's experience. Materials/Methods: Patients and volunteers enrolled on two prospective clinical trials were fitted, positioned, and immobilized using the RHF. The RHF includes a patient-specific detachable front mouthpiece for dental and hard palate impression. A vacuum is applied to ensure tensionless fixation without the need for active patient cooperation. For positioning, a 1mm action threshold was used. To capture the tolerability of the RHF, subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire immediately after initial fitting, CT simulation, and at the end of their treatment. The questions addressed overall impression and discomfort during the various stages of the procedure. Result(s): Six volunteers completed study procedures without difficulty. Of 21 patients enrolled, one patient was aborted due to geometric constraints of the RHF colliding with his skull, and one patient withdrew from study participation. For the four patients treated on Perfexion the mean difference between CT and PFX position was less than 1mm.Patient anatomy including a high palate, short neck, and broad shoulders were identified as challenges to clinical use of the RHF. Gagging during fitting occurred in six patients and with one patient during positioning. Qualitative review of questionnaires revealed 5 themes: (1) patients have an overall positive impression of the process; (2) most find the dental imprint procedure distressing; (3) positioning was fairly tolerated; (4) overall discomfort during the time of immobilization is none to mild in the hard palate; (5) discomfort to the neck, shoulders and back is mild. Conclusion(s): The study result highlights challenges related to the dental impression procedure, and the importance of a careful patient selection. From the patients perspective the procedure is fairly well tolerated, and may improve by addressing discomforts during the fitting procedure. Positioning within a sub-millimeter accuracy threshold is achievable.",Excluded

Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been proposed as an alternative to surgical resection. We report serious adverse effects of the treatment after follow-up periods over 9 years in 11 patients treated with GKRS between 1997 and 2000. The target volume of the entorhinoamygdalohippocampectomy area was 4.8-17.1 ml. Marginal dose of 20-25 Gy to the 50% isodose was delivered. One patient was drowned after suffering seizure 7 months after GKRS. Two patients did not show any reduction in seizure frequency over 9 and 18 months. Both patients requested open surgery and became seizure-free postoperatively. Four of the other eight patients were classified as Engel's class I within 4 years after GKRS. One of the four patients experienced symptomatic radiation-induced cerebral edema transiently, one developed radiation necrosis and required surgery 5 years after GKRS, and one developed cognitive impairment with hemiparesis 10 years after GKRS. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a large cyst in the irradiated temporal lobe. This patient recovered fully after the cyst excision. Only one patient became seizure-free and antiepileptic drug-free without symptomatic radiation-induced complications. However, MR imaging revealed abnormal enhancement, cyst formation, and diffuse white matter change in the irradiated temporal lobe 9 years after GKRS. GKRS for MTLE causes adverse effects of delayed seizure remission and symptomatic radiation-induced complications. Therefore, GKRS cannot be considered as an ideal alternative to surgery for MTLE. Long-term follow-up studies including MR imaging with contrast medium are required for the patients even after successful control of seizures.",Excluded

Background: Since imaging evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) or lumbar disc herniations (LDH) may not be associated with symptoms, classification criteria based upon patient symptoms and physical examination findings are required. This study sought to develop a set of criteria identifying patients with neurogenic claudication (NC) caused by LSS and patient with radicular pain (RP) caused by LDH Results concerning NC caused by LSS are reported. Methods Phase 1: 17 spine specialists from 8 countries participated in a Delphi process, using an internet program, to rank symptoms and signs which suggest LSS as the cause of NC or DH as the cause of RP. Phase 2: 18 different spine specialists (surgeons and nonsurgeons) recruited patients during office visits and classify them with a high degree of confidence as having with either: 1) NC caused by LSS 2) RP caused by LDH or 3) non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) with non-specific leg pain radiation. Patients completed survey items and specialists documented examination signs. Signs and symptoms present in >=10 patients were analyzed by using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Patients with NC caused by LSS or NSLBP served as controls. Items with p <0.1 in univariate analysis were entered in the multivariate analysis. A score to predict NC caused by LSS was developed based on the coefficient of the GEE, and used to obtain a ROC curve and the associated area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): A list of 46 clinical signs and 28 patient-reported symptoms were selected by the group of spine specialists during the 1st phase. For the 2nd phase, 209 patients with high confidence in the diagnosis were included 63 NC caused by LSS, 89 RP caused by DH, and 57 NSLBP with non-specific leg pain radiation. Items which predicted NC with a p-value <0.1 included age >60, bilateral leg pain, leg pain relieved by sitting, leg pain decreased by leaning or flexing, positive30 seconds extension test, negative straight leg raise test. The score had an AUC of 0.91, and the cutoff to obtain a specificity of 92.1% resulted in a sensitivity of 80.0%. Conclusion(s): An international collaboration of surgeon and nonsurgeon spine specialists produced a set of diagnostic criteria with high specificity and sensitivity for identifying patients with NC caused by LSS. Using this set could improve the quality of basic science and clinical research in this field by improving homogeneity within groups of patients.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of the spine provides superior tumor control, but vertebral compression fractures are increased and the pathophysiological process underneath is not well understood. Data on histopathological changes, particularly after salvage SBRT (sSBRT) following conventional irradiation, are scarce.OBJECTIVE: To investigate surgical specimens after sSBRT and primary SBRT (pSBRT) regarding histopathological changes.METHODS: We assessed 704 patients treated with spine SBRT 2006 to 2012. Thirty patients underwent salvage surgery; 23 histopathological reports were available. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed for sSBRT (69.6%) and pSBRT (30.4%).RESULTS: Mean time to surgery after sSBRT/pSBRT was 8.3/10.3 mo (P = .64). Reason for surgery included pain (sSBRT/pSBRT: 12.5%/71.4%, P = .25), fractures (sSBRT/pSBRT: 37.5%/28.6%, P = .68), and neurological symptoms (sSBRT/pSBRT: 68.8%/42.9%, P = .24). Radiological tumor progression after sSBRT/pSBRT was seen in 71.4%/42.9% (P = .2). Most specimens displayed viable/proliferative tumor (sSBRT/pSBRT: 62.5%/71.4%, P = .68 and 56.3%/57.1%, P = .97). Few specimens showed soft tissue necrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 20%/28.6%, P = .66), osteonecrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 14.3%/16.7%, P = .89), or bone marrow fibrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 42.9%/33.3%, P = .69). Tumor bed necrosis was more common after sSBRT (81.3%/42.9%, P = .066). Radiological tumor progression correlated with viable/proliferative tumor (P = .03/P = .006) and tumor bed necrosis (P = .03). Fractures were increased with bone marrow fibrosis (P = .07), but not with osteonecrosis (P = .53) or soft tissue necrosis (P = .19). Neurological symptoms were common with radiological tumor progression (P = .07), but not with fractures (P = .18).CONCLUSION: For both, sSBRT and pSBRT, histopathological changes were similar.

The morphometry of c-Fos-protein positive neurons by their number and type was analyzed. Movement restriction (40 min) induced c-Fos protein expression primarily in cells with 10-50 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (associative type neurons) only in anterior hypothalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area; while additional EHF-irradiation of acupuncture projection areas (under movement restriction) induced c-Fos expression in all hypothalamic structures and mostly in cells with 70-150 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (relay type neurons), i.e. changed the pattern of activated cell type distribution. In conclusion, the findings show that modest stress under which experimental animals often are exposed increase c-Fos protein expression in hypothalamic centers and skin EHF-irradiation of acupuncture projection areas seem to increase that.

Worldwide, approximately 100,000 patients have undergone stereotactic radiosurgery for a variety of intracranial lesions, of which brain metastases represent the most common treatment indication. This article summarizes the major issues surrounding the management of brain metastases, and also analyzes 21 independent reports of Gamma Knife- or linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, representing over 1,700 patients and more than 2,700 lesions. Variable reporting in the studies precludes a definitive, rigorous analysis, but the composite data reveal an average local control rate of 83% and median survival of 9.6 months, both of which are comparable to results in recent surgical reports. The most important prognostic factors for survival appear to be fewer than three lesions, controlled extracranial disease, and Karnofsky performance score (KPS). The exact impact of dose has not been clarified, but a dose-response relationship, especially for > or = 18 Gy, is emerging. The role of whole-brain radiotherapy remains unresolved. It may enhance local control but does not convincingly improve survival and, in some series, is associated with an increased risk of late complications. Chronic steroid dependence and increased intracranial edema do not appear to be common problems. This is an opportune time for the completion of ongoing randomized trials to validate these observations. [References: 46]",Excluded
2265,"Prospective trial evaluating difference in radiation target volume on 3T versus 1.5T mr for patients with malignant gliomas. Purpose/Objective(s): It is hypothesized that there is a difference in the peritumoral and tumor related signal abnormality detected by 1.5 tesla (T) versus 3T T2 FLAIR magnet resonance imaging (MRIs). We assessed the difference in radiation treatment gross tumor volumes (GTVs) defined by four investigators for high-grade gliomas as determined using 1.5T vs. 3T MRIs. Materials/Methods: A total of 23 patients with newly diagnosed, high grade-gliomas were enrolled in this IRB approved prospective trial. All patients underwent a 1.5T and 3T MR scans within a 24-hour period, with no treatment or steroid dose change between scans. The 1.5T study was part of the clinical standard of care and hence was the MR imaging with intravenous gadolinium administration and was used for radiation treatment planning. Gadolinium was not given at 3T imaging. The imaging parameters for T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were those that are clinically employed at this institution. Image processing and radiation planning was performed using radiation oncology software. MRIs were fused by a designated physicist and were reviewed by a radiation oncologist. GTV delineation was independently performed by 4 experienced investigators: 2 radiation oncologists and 2 neurosurgeons. To decrease inherent biases, investigators contoured 1.5T and 3T MRs separately, with a minimum of 72 hours between contours, blinded to other contours. GTV was defined by the extent of peritumoral edema depicted by high T2 FLAIR signal abnormality. For each patient and investigator the volumes defined by FLAIR images at 1.5 and 3T were determined and the ratio of the volumes (GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>) were calculated. The mean volume ratios were calculated for each investigator as well as an overall average. To assess the consistency of contours from investigator to investigator, the standard deviations and range of the volumes amongst all investigators were determined for each patient at each field strength. Result(s): The volumes ratios for each investigator (GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>) were 0.86 +/- 0.20 (range, 0.37-1.03), 0.90 +/- 0.20 (range, 0.19-1.08), 0.94 +/- 0.18 (range, 0.37-1.14), and 0.98 +/- 0.14 (range, 0.66-1.18). One patient was clearly an outlier, with 3T volumes 0.19 to 0.66 that of the 1.5T volumes. The overall GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>ratio was 0.95 +/- 0.19. Excluding the outlier produced an overall GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup> ratio 0.94 +/- 0.13 (range, 0.57-1.18). The 1.5T studies produced less variability from investigator to investigator. Thirty-nine percent of contoured volumes were different by greater than 10%. Conclusion(s): At this institution, it was found that flair defined GTVs for high grade gliomas were on average smaller that at 3T. There was increased volume variability on 3T MR.",Excluded
2653,"Plasma membrane nanoporation as a possible mechanism behind infrared excitation of cells. OBJECTIVE: Short infrared (IR) laser pulses have been used to stimulate action potentials in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon has remained elusive. In vitro studies have found that pulsed IR exposure generates a nearly instant change in capacitance in the plasma membrane, characterized by inward rectification, a common feature in pore-forming exposures, such as electrical pulses and acoustic shock waves. Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that the mechanism of IR stimulation is the formation of short-lived nanopores in the plasma membrane. These transient, small-diameter pores allow the influx of extracellular ions that lead to action potential generation, possibly through activation of secondary messenger pathways or depolarization of the cell membrane resulting in activation of voltage-gated ion channels.APPROACH: A variety of fluorescent markers are used to observe the cell response to IR stimulation to monitor for effects indicative of nanoporation in other modalities.MAIN RESULTS: We observe rapid, transient rises in intracellular Ca(2+), influx of YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide into the cell signifying membrane permeabilization, cellular blebbing and swelling, and activation of the intracellular phosphoinositides lipid signaling pathway.SIGNIFICANCE: This conclusion better explains the experimental observations and limitations of IR-induced neurological stimulation and represents a distinct theoretical shift in the understanding of the mechanism of IR-induced stimulation.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer.METHODS: Clinical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pneumonectomy at our institution between 1995 and 2005 after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation. Of the 21 men and 8 women who were treated, 1 had stage IIB (T3N0M0) and the remainder had stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Mean patient age at surgery was 53.4 years. There were 15 right pneumonectomies, of which 2 were for pancoast tumors. All patients received concurrent preoperative chemoradiation. Mean total radiation dose was 61.1 Gy. All patients went on to have complete (R0) resection by pneumonectomy. Pathologic complete response was found in 16 patients (55.2%). All patients were discharged alive from the hospital after pneumonectomy. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (mean 8.6). Ninety-day mortality after surgery was 3.4% (n = 1). Recurrences have been found in 11 patients (38%), including brain metastases (n = 6), bone metastases (n = 4), liver metastases (n = 2), and cervical lymph node metastases (n = 2). One patient had a contralateral new primary lung cancer develop 70 months after undergoing pneumonectomy. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival is 48%. Median survival time has not been reached.CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonectomy can be performed safely after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, even with high-dose radiation.

2990,"Antiphosphatidylserine antibody combined with irradiation damages tumor blood vessels and induces tumor immunity in a rat model of glioblastoma. PURPOSE: The vascular targeting antibody bavituximab is being combined with chemotherapy in clinical trials in cancer patients. Bavituximab targets the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, complexed with beta2-glycoprotein I. Phosphatidylserine is normally intracellular but becomes exposed on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium in tumors. Phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor vessels is increased by chemotherapy and irradiation. Here, we determined whether treatment with the murine equivalent of bavituximab, 2aG4, combined with irradiation can suppress tumor growth in a rat model of glioblastoma.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: F98 glioma cells were injected into the brains of syngeneic rats where they grow initially as a solid tumor and then infiltrate throughout the brain. Rats with established tumors were treated with 10 Gy whole brain irradiation and 2aG4.RESULTS: Combination treatment doubled the median survival time of the rats, and 13% of animals were rendered disease free. Neither treatment given individually was as effective. We identified two mechanisms. First, irradiation induced phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor blood vessels and enhanced antibody-mediated destruction of tumor vasculature by monocytes/macrophages. Second, the antibody treatment induced immunity to F98 tumor cells, which are normally weakly immunogenic. Surviving rats were immune to rechallenge with F98 tumor cells. In vitro, 2aG4 enhanced the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to generate F98-specific cytotoxic T cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure, which is induced on tumor cells by irradiation, likely suppresses tumor antigen presentation, and 2aG4 blocks this tolerogenic effect.CONCLUSION: Bavituximab combined with radiotherapy holds promise as a vascular targeting and immune enhancement strategy for the treatment of human glioblastoma.",Excluded
1365,"Revolution in Radiation. In the past few decades, there have been many changes in the field of radiotherapy. These include better imaging, better motion management, improvements in treatment planning, better position verification and more precise treatment delivery. This has led to an increased use of radiotherapy and to significant improvements in clinical outcome. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT, aka SABR) is currently the standard of care for patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC. The technique is now safely used for more centrally located, larger and multiple lesions as well. SBRT is increasingly being considered as an alternative to surgery in operable patients. The results of two randomized clinical trials which were closed prematurely due to poor accrual, suggest equivalence between SBRT and surgery. Comparative effectiveness studies point in the same direction. New randomized trials on this topic are currently recruiting. In stage III NSCLC, radiotherapy can also be delivered with increased precision. Although the use of much higher dose has not (yet) led to better outcomes, the newer radiation techniques are associated with less toxicity and over the years, there has been a steady improvement in control and survival rates. The use of immunotherapy in combination with radiotherapy holds many promises. The role of proton therapy is still investigational. For patients with oligometastatic disease or oligoprogression, local treatments including radiotherapy can be highly effective and may lead to long term control and improvements in survival. We are awaiting the results of randomized studies to unequivocally show this benefit. In LS-SCLC, there is still discussion on the schemes for thoracic radiotherapy (BID or QD). The improvement in median survival in both arms of the recent CONVERT trial compared to earlier studies are probably exemplary for the general improvements in radiotherapy techniques. In ES-SCLC patients, thoracic radiotherapy is advocated for those patients with a response after chemotherapy but with residual disease in their chest. In ES-SCLC, prophylactic cranial irradiation is nowadays sometimes replaced with MRI-surveillance. Delayed cranial irradiation is than used in about two out of three patients. An important breakthrough in radiotherapy is the introduction of MRI guidance on the linear accelerator. This not only provides better soft-tissue imaging, but also for the first time, continuous imaging during the delivery of the treatment. The anatomical information from the MRI made daily with the patient on the treatment couch can be used to daily adapt the treatment plan. This allows for the use of smaller margins and early results demonstrate important benefits, especially in high-risk patients.

Removal of mechanical loading (spaceflight, bedrest, casting) causes rapid atrophy of affected skeletal muscles. Recently, we identified that translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSmu) and downstream activation of FoxO3a were redox-sensitive phenomena. Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU-induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber-type shift from slow to fast twitch. Loss of sarcolemmal nNOSmu activity with HU, visualized using NADPH diaphorase and confirmed with immunofluorescence were also mitigated by gp91dsTAT. Gp91dsTAT also attenuated membrane localization of the Nox2 subunit p67phox. We conclude that Nox2 inhibition protects against muscle fiber atrophy and translocation of nNOSmu.",Excluded
158,"Microinjection of morphine into various amygdaloid nuclei differentially affects nociceptive responsiveness and RVM neuronal activity. The goal of the present study was to identify nuclei of the amygdala in which opioid-sensitive systems can act to recruit nociceptive modulatory circuitry in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and affect nociceptive responsiveness. In lightly anesthetized rats, 10 microg of morphine was bilaterally microinjected into basolateral, cortical, medial, central, and lateral nuclei of the amygdala to determine the relative influence on the activity of identified ON, OFF and NEUTRAL cells in the RVM and on the latency of the tail flick reflex evoked by noxious radiant heat. Infusions of morphine into the basolateral nuclei resulted in a substantial, naloxone-reversible increase in tail flick latency, and significantly increased ongoing firing of OFF cells and depressed that of ON cells. The reflex-related changes in cell firing were also attenuated. Morphine infusions into the cortical nuclei resulted in a small (approximately 1 s) but significant increase in tail flick latency. As with basolateral microinjections, ongoing activity of the OFF cells was increased, and although the ongoing firing of ON cells was not significantly changed, the reflex-related burst that characterizes these neurons was reduced. Microinjections in the medial nuclei again altered ongoing activity of both ON cells and OFF cells. However, the duration of the OFF cell pause and tail flick latency were unchanged. NEUTRAL cells were not affected by morphine at any site. Morphine applied within the central, medial lateral and dorsal lateral nuclei had no effect on RVM neurons or on the tail flick. Thus, focal application of morphine within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala produced hypoalgesia and influenced RVM ON and OFF cells in a manner similar to that seen following systemic or RVM opioid administration. Opioid action within the medial and cortical nuclei also influenced RVM cell activity, but did not prevent the reflex-related OFF cell pause, and failed to alter the tail flick substantially. These observations, plus the lack of an opioid-activated influence from the central and lateral nuclei, demonstrate fundamental differences among systems linking the different amygdalar nuclei with the RVM. One way in which the modulatory circuitry of the RVM might be engaged physiologically in behaving animals is via opioid-mediated activation of the basolateral nucleus.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective: Radiation-induced alopecia in hypofractionated whole brain radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost (WBRT+SIB) is an understudied issue, even in RTOG 9508. However, this effect has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients. We have currently found a technical solution to this problem. Our current protocol for WBRT+SIB is presented and described, incluiding a retrospective review of the results in relation to radiation-induced alopecia. Material(s) and Method(s): The protocol already implemented in our department is based on a frame-less procedure compatible with masks of type 35764/2MA/M (Orfit Industries N.V., Wijnegem, Belgium), submasks of eXaSkin (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain) and a resonance compatible frame eXaFrame (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain). CT and MR studies of 1mm slice thickness are acquired with similar length, position and inmovilization. The whole procedure and the resulting high quality fussion is ensured by the eXaFrame system.

Two CCW VMAT arcs (178degree to 60degree and 300degree to 182degree) are added, with the following objectives: Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 1), brain-CPE (D<inf>max</inf>= 21 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 20 Gy, weight = 50), eyes(D<inf>max</inf>= 10 Gy, weight = 1). Thereafter, we work separately on the metastases blocking the optimization of the prophylaxis and creating three structures: VI1 = PTV (MTS1)+ 5 mm, VI2 = PTV (MTS2)+ 5 mm, Epx = brain-VI1-VI2. Objectives were: PTVI (D<inf>max</inf>= 44 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 40 Gy weight = 50), Epx (D<inf>max</inf>= 30 Gy) ,brain stem (D<inf>max</inf>= 23 Gy) and Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 20). Result(s): We have treated 14 patients until now. Fusion images have shown differences less than 1mm while mean IGRT correction has been 1.34mm. No acute toxicity have been observed, including neither alopecia nor temporal depilation. Conclusion(s): This protocol has been designed and developed in our hospital, considering the alopecia as toxicity in VMAT optimization. It produces excellent cosmetic results, avoiding alopecia in practically all cases, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. As a general consideration, we would like to point out that that it should be considered mandatory to use all advanced tools available on modern radiotherapy to minimize toxicity in radiation treatments.",Excluded
1759,"Brain metastases from colorectal carcinoma: a description of 60 cases in a single Chinese cancer center. The incidence of brain metastasis (BM) from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is increasing. The objectives of the present study were to explore the clinical characteristics and potential prognostic factors in CRC patients with BM. Between April 1991 and December 2010, all CRC patients treated in the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed and 60 patients were identified to have BM (36 males and 24 females). The association between patients and their tumor characteristics, treatment modality, and survival were statistically analyzed. The median age at diagnosis of BM was 62.5 years. Fifty-three patients (88.3%) developed extracranial metastases at diagnosis of BM. The cause of death was systemic disease in 19 patients and neurological disease in 23 patients. Brain metastases were primarily treated with either whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT; 15 patients), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; nine patients), or surgical resection (seven patients). Ten patients received WBRT and SRS, and 19 patients (31.7%) were treated with steroids alone. The median survival after diagnosis of BM was 8 months (95% confidence interval = 4.2-11.8 months). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, the number of brain lesions, and treatment modality type were significantly associated with survival. Although BM from CRC is a late-stage phenomenon with an extremely poor prognosis, some subsets of patients would benefit from a multidisciplinary management strategy. A low RPA class and a limited number of brain lesions may predict increased survival after therapy for CRC patients with BM.",Excluded
3044,"A review on radiogenic Lhermitte's sign. Radiation myelopathy is a rare, but extremely serious side-effect of radiotherapy. Recovery from radiation-induced motor sequelae is rare, whereas, the regeneration of sensory losses is relatively frequent. Among the sensory radiogenic injuries of the spinal cord, Lhermitte's sign (LS) is most frequent. This review describes the clinical picture and diagnostic imaging signs of radiogenic LS. There have been only a few studies on large patient groups with radiogenic LS, demonstrating a rate of occurrence of 3.6-13%, relating mainly to mantle irradiation or the radiotherapy of head and neck tumors. These cases typically manifest themselves 3 months following radiotherapy and gradually disappear within 6 months. Only 3 LS cases have been described in the English literature with extraordinarily severe symptoms lasting for more than 1 year. MRI, a sensitive tool in the detection of demyelination, failed to reveal any pathological sign accompanying radiogenic LS. However, positron emission tomography demonstrated increased [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation and [15O]butanol perfusion, but a negligible [11C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in patients with long-standing LS. These imaging data are suggestive of a close direct relationship between the regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, very much like the situation in the brain. We postulate that an altered, energy-demanding conduction along the demyelinated axons of patients with chronic radiogenic LS may explain the increased metabolism and perfusion.

The current study was conducted to evaluate the effects of UV-B radiation on survival rate and histopathological changes in the skin structure and ultrastructure in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) alevins. In laboratory dark conditions, newly hatched rainbow trout alevins were exposed to two different doses of UV-B radiation (high dose: HD: 94.83 muW cm(-2)) and (low dose: LD: 68.75 muW cm(-2)) for 9 days (time of exposure: 15 min per day), whereas specimens kept in darkness served as a control group. At the end of the experiment, alevins exposed to HD-UVB had the lowest survival rate (43.9 +/- 0.9%), whereas fish exposed to LD-UVB showed intermediate values (73.6 +/- 0.4%) with regard to the control group (91.2 +/- 0.2%). Light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic studies revealed necrosis, sunburned cells, epidermis lifting of the epidermis, reduced number of mucous cells, degeneration of mucous cells and destruction of pavement cell microridges in both UV-B exposed groups.

863,"Low-dose radiation enhances survivin-mediated virotherapy against malignant glioma stem cells. To improve the efficacy and selectivity of virotherapy for malignant glioma, we designed a strategy to amplify adenoviral replication in conjunction with radiotherapy using a radioinducible promoter. First, we compared the radiation-inducible activity of FLT-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, DR5, Cox2, and survivin. We then examined the capacity of the optimal promoter to modulate transgene expression followed by E1A activity in vitro and in vivo in a glioma stem cell model. In the presence of radiation, survivin mRNA activity increased 10-fold. Luciferase transgene expression was dose dependent and optimal at 2 Gy. A novel oncolytic adenovirus, CRAd-Survivin-pk7, showed significant toxicity and replication against a panel of passaged and primary CD133(+) glioma stem cells. On delivery of radiation, the toxicity associated with CRAd-Survivin-pk7 increased by 20% to 50% (P < 0.05). At the same time, the level of E1A activity increased 3- to 10-fold. In vivo, treatment of U373MG CD133(+) stem cells with CRAd-Survivin-pk7 and radiation significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < 0.05). At the same time, the level of E1A activity was 100-fold increased versus CRAd-Survivin-pk7 alone. Selected genes linked to radioinducible promoters whose expression can be regulated by ionizing radiation may improve the therapeutic ratio of virotherapy. In this study, we have identified a new radioinducible promoter, survivin, which greatly enhances the activity of an oncolytic adenovirus in the presence of low-dose radiotherapy.",Excluded

972,"Immunomodulatory effect of new quinolone derivative against cisplatin/gamma radiation-induced renal and brain toxicity in mice. Treatment of cancer often requires exposure to radiation, which has several limitations involving non-specific toxicity toward normal cells, reducing the efficacy of treatment. Recent studies synthesize new quinolone derivatives to satisfy other purposes such as treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases. The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a new quinolone derivative; 2-(1-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (EHQA) and its possible mechanism against gamma radiation (IRR) and cisplatin (Cis) induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in mice. The structure of the newly synthesized quinolone derivative was elucidated by microanalytical and spectral data, which were found consistent with the assigned structures. Exposure to Cis and IRR significantly induced renal damage manifested by a significant increase in levels of urea and creatinine. Moreover, the exposure to both Cis and IRR significantly decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein; Bcl-2 in both renal and brain tissue homogenate accompanied by activation of an inflammatory marker; IL-17. Immunophenoting results showed an activation of T- lymphocytes marker; CD3 and B-lymphocytes marker; CD19. Interperitonial administration of EHQA significantly ameliorated the above-mentioned parameters. Overall, the present results indicated that EHQA is a promising anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. From the obtained results it can be concluded that EHQA could be a candidate as immunomodulatory agents. Further studies are required to establish its molecular mechanism.",Excluded

1444,"Cancer pain (classification and pain syndromes). Inspite the new informations about the physiology and biochemistry of pain, it remains true that pain is only partially understood. Cancer pain is often experienced as several different types of pain, with combined somatic and neuropathic types the most frequently. If the acute cancer pain does not subside with initial therapy, patients experience pain of more constant nature, the characteristics of wich vary with the cause and the involved sites. Chronic pain related to cancer can be considered as tumor-induced pain, chemotherapy-induced pain, and radiation therapy-induced pain. Certain pain mechanisms are present in cancer patients. These include inflammation due to infection, such as local sepsis or the pain of herpes zoster, and pain due to the obstruction or occlusion of a hollow organ, such as that caused by large bowel in cancer of colon. Pain also is commonly due to destruction of tissue, such as is often seen with bony metastases. Bony metastases also produce pain because of periostal irritation, medullary pressure, and fractures. Pain may be produced by the growth of tumor in a closed area richly supplied with pain receptors (nociceptors). Examples are tumors growing within the capsule of an organ such as the pancreas. Chest pain occurring after tumor of the lung or the mediastinum due to invasion of the pleura. Certain tumors produce characteristic types of pain. For example, back pain is seen with multiple myeloma, and severe shoulder pain and arm pain is seen with Pancoast tumors. [References: 42]",Excluded
3145,"Test of the paired-flash electroretinographic method in mice lacking b-waves. Previous studies of rod photoreceptors in vivo have employed a paired-flash electroretinographic (ERG) technique to determine rod response properties. To test whether absence versus presence of the ERG b-wave affects the photoreceptor response derived by the paired-flash method, we examined paired-flash-derived responses obtained from nob mice, a mutant strain with a defect in signal transduction between photoreceptors and ON bipolar cells that causes a lack of the b-wave. Normal littermates of the nob mice served as controls. The normalized amplitude-intensity relation of the derived response determined in nob mice at the near-peak time of 86 ms was similar to that determined for the controls. The full time course of the derived rod response was obtained for test flash strengths ranging from 0.11 to 17.38 scotopic cd s m(-2) (sc cd s m(-2)). Time-course data obtained from nob and control mice exhibited significant but generally modest differences. With saturating test flash strengths, half-recovery times for the derived response of nob versus control mice differed by approximately 60 ms or less about the combined (nob and control) average respective values. Time course data also were obtained before versus after intravitreal injection of L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) (which blocks transmission from photoreceptors to depolarizing bipolar cells) and of cis 2,3-piperidine dicarboxylic acid (PDA) (which blocks transmission to OFF bipolar cells, and to horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells). Neither APB nor PDA substantially affected derived responses obtained from nob or control mice. The results provide quantitative information on the effect of b-wave removal on the paired-flash-derived response in mouse. They argue against a substantial skewing effect of the b-wave on the paired-flash-derived response obtained in normal mice and are consistent with the notion that, to good approximation, this derived response represents the isolated flash response of the photoreceptors in both nob and normal mice.",Excluded

The stimulus that activates muscle nociceptors in such instance may be protons. Reportedly, however, not many afferents are excited by protons alone. We, therefore, posited that protons sensitize muscular nociceptors to mechanical stimuli. We examined effects of protons on mechanical sensitivity of muscle nociceptors by single-fiber recording from rat muscle-nerve preparations in vitro and by whole cell patch-clamp recording of mechanically activated (MA) currents from cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. We recorded 38 Adelta- and C-fibers. Their response magnitude was increased by both pH 6.2 and pH 6.8; in addition the mechanical threshold was lowered by pH 6.2. Decrease in the threshold by pH6.2 was also observed in MA currents. Presently observed sensitization by protons could be involved in several types of ischemic muscle pain, and may also be involved in cardiovascular and respiratory controls during exercise.",Excluded

Addition of SK to the medium prevented a reduction of the viability of mature (14 days) dissociated neocortical cell culture from 1-2-day-old rats, induced by a transfer of the culture to a blood serum protein-deficient medium. In a 7-day culture SK potentiated the decrease in the cell viability. In organotypical cultures, with the use of electron microscopy, it was found that SK in concentration used prevented the development of destructive changes in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons of explants, induced by a deficit in serum proteins. The neurons contained numerous mitochondria, some of which had only a few cristae. Signs of destruction were observed only in neuronal nuclei.

In this retrospective study, these subjects were evaluated by considering our patients results. Seventy patients having adequate data for examination with limited-stage SCLC were referred to our clinic in the period between December 1995 and December 2002. The patients were classified according to their response to CT, the dose and timing of RT applications. The effects of obtained variables on overall survival were analyzed. Male/ female ratio was 5/1; and the mean age was 55 years (range 31-80 years). The mean follow-up of all patients was 10 months and the mean survival time was 16 months. An objective (complete and partial) response to CT administered before RT was seen in 47 (67%) patients. The survival time was better in the CT responding patients (median 11 months versus 6 months, p= 0.002). The application of more than 50 Gy radiation dose was found to be ineffective on survival. An improvement in survival was observed in RT application beginning before fourth cycle CT (median 14 months versus 8 months p= 0.01). In despite of the ineffectiveness of prophylactic cranial irradiation on survival is observed in survival analysis, it was found to be a parameter affecting survival in Cox-regression analysis. However the most frequently complication during RT was oesophagitis. Grade III was seen in 1 (3%) patient. The response to CT can be accepted as an indicator for survival. We concluded that the administering of RT in the beginning of CT, not administering radiation doses of more than 50 Gy and the necessity of applying prophylactic cranial irradiation to all patients showing complete response are points to be considered according to our retrospective analysis.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To clarify the incidence, symptoms, and timing of extrapulmonary fibrosis developing after hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 379 consecutive patients who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung tumors at four institutions between February 2001 and March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 1-72). We investigated the subjective and objective characteristics of the extrapulmonary masses, redelineated the origin tissue of each on the treatment planning computed tomography scan, and generated dose-volume histograms.RESULTS: In 9 patients (2.4%), extrapulmonary masses were found 3-36 months (median, 14) after irradiation. Coexisting swelling occurred in 3 patients, chest pain in 2, thumb numbness in 1, and arm edema in 1 patient. Extrapulmonary masses occurred in 5 (5.4%) of 92 and 4 (1.4%) of 287 patients irradiated with a 62.5-Gy and 48.0-Gy isocenter dose, respectively. The mean and maximal dose to the origin tissue was 25.8-53.9 Gy (median, 43.7) and 47.5-62.5 Gy (median, 50.2), respectively.

Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or 2 (IDH2) are found in a subset of gliomas. Among the many phenotypic differences between mutant and wild-type IDH1/2 gliomas, the most salient is that IDH1/2 mutant glioma patients demonstrate markedly improved survival compared with IDH1/2 wild-type glioma patients. To address the mechanism underlying the superior clinical outcome of IDH1/2 mutant glioma patients, we investigated whether overexpression of the IDH1(R132H) protein could affect response to therapy in the context of an isogenic glioma cell background. Stable clonal U87MG and U373MG cell lines overexpressing IDH1(WT) and IDH1(R132H) were generated, as well as U87MG cell lines overexpressing IDH2(WT) and IDH2(R172K). In vitro experiments were conducted to characterize baseline growth and migration and response to radiation and temozolomide. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured under various conditions. U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells, U373MG-IDH1(R132H) cells, and U87MG-IDH2(R172K) cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to radiation but not to temozolomide. Radiosensitization of U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells was accompanied by increased apoptosis and accentuated ROS generation, and this effect was abrogated by the presence of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine. Interestingly, U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells also displayed decreased growth at higher cell density and in soft agar, as well as decreased migration. Overexpression of IDH1(R132H) and IDH2(R172K) mutant protein in glioblastoma cells resulted in increased radiation sensitivity and altered ROS metabolism and suppression of growth and migration in vitro. These findings provide insight into possible mechanisms contributing to the improved outcomes observed in patients with IDH1/2 mutant gliomas.",Excluded

Recoverin is a 23-kDa Ca(2+)-binding protein found predominantly in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Recent electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest that recoverin may regulate the photoresponse by inhibiting rhodopsin phosphorylation. We find in both cell homogenates and reconstituted systems that the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by recoverin occurs over a significantly higher free Ca2+ range than previously reported. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 1.5-3 microM free Ca2+ and is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. Measurements of transducin activation demonstrate that this inhibition prolongs the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin. Ca(2+)-recoverin directly inhibits rhodopsin kinase activity, and Ca(2+)-dependent binding of recoverin to rod outer segment membranes is not required for its action. Extrapolation of the in vitro data to in vivo conditions based on simple mass action calculations places the Ca(2+)-recoverin regulation within the physiological free Ca2+ range in intact rod outer segment. The data are consistent with a model in which the fall in free Ca2+ that accompanies rod excitation exerts negative feedback by relieving inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation.",Excluded

It is important to study the results that could be achieved when TARE is being used to treat liver metastasis of other origin. This retrospective analysis concentrates on our institutional experience with TARE for the treatment of liver metastasis from neuroendocrine cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Our institutional review board (IRB)-approved Y-90 databank was reviewed to identify patients with neuroendocrine cancer who received Y-90 TARE for liver metastasis from February 2011 to September 2013. Information on patient demographics, performance status, disease-related characteristics (liver panel, complete blood count [CBC], chromogranin A, and gross tumor volume [GTV] measured in cc on the most recent study pre-TARE), treatment-related parameters (Y-90 dose delivered), and treatment outcome (treatment toxicity, overall survival [OS]) were captured for this analysis. Result(s): Between February 2011 and September 2013, a total of 16 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine (liver-predominant disease) received Y-90 TARE in our institution. Eight of these patients received treatment to both liver lobes, for a total of 24 procedures. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0 and 2 prior to treatment. In addition, all patients had a bilirubin level below 2.0 and an albumin level above 3.0 prior to treatment. The median GTV per lobe was 299 cc (range: 27-670 cc). With a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range: 2-26 mo), the 1-year OS was 75%. There was no relationship between OS and GTV volume. Two patients with severe endocrine disorders that required repeated hospitalization (one patient with severe hypoglycemia and a second patient with hypertensive crisis) responded well to TARE, with marked improvement in their medical condition and no need for further admission postprocedure. In terms of treatment toxicity, one patient was diagnosed with a radiation-induced liver disease and died 13 months post-treatment. One patient developed a pancytopenia that was potentially related to treatment. Conclusion(s): The use of Y-90 TARE for patients with liver metastasis from neuroendocrine carcinoma is a treatment option that should be assessed in a prospective multicentric study. In this series, Y-90 TARE was associated with a high 1-year survival rate. However, patients need to be monitored closely postprocedure, since serious treatment-related toxicity could develop.",Excluded

Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare, benign histiocytosis disorder with only -100 reported cases in the literature. Even less common is skull base involvement of RDD, with only 41 reported cases. Radiographically, RDD can appear very similar to a meningioma, and RDD can only be diagnosed with tissue biopsy. This ""benign"" condition can cause significant neurologic morbidity both from the disease and unnecessary surgical treatment of the disease. Although rare, generally intracranial RDD has been treated with chemotherapy or radiation with limited role for surgery to relieve mass effect. Surgical approaches to the skull base are invasive and pose risk, especially for a benign and self-limiting disease like RDD. Presented, is the case of a 63-year-old woman with a presumed spheno-cavernous meningioma that was previously radiated without tissue diagnosis. In the interim, she was diagnosed with RDD by her dermatologist after skin biopsy. Upon presentation, the patient was experiencing retroorbital headaches and blurry vision, and MR imaging demonstrated progression of her lesion. On examination she had mild right proptosis and a partial Cranial Nerve III palsy. For these reasons, surgical biopsy was undertaken with the goal of orbital and optic nerve decompressions. An endoscopic endonasal unilateral approach was performed to sample tissue at the superior orbital fissure, with bony decompression of the orbit and optic canal. Her symptoms stabilized and the diagnosis was made of skull base RDD, after which she was started on steroids and methotrexate. At 1-month follow-up the patient remained well. Her proptosis improved, Cranial Nerve III symptoms remained stable, and her RDD remained stable as well. Hematology will start this patient on Cladribine for more intensive systemic therapy.

Fractionation was based on the size of the tumor, proximity to the brainstem, and potential risk of neurological sequelae. Median follow-up time was 55.2 months.RESULTS: The pretreatment median tumor diameter was significantly smaller for SRS (1.14 cm) compared with hSRT (1.7 cm) (P = .03) and cfSRT (2.0 cm) (P < .001). The overall local tumor control was 96.4%: 100% SRS, 100% hSRT, and 90% cfSRT (P = .19). Tumor regression was observed in 53.3% of SRS, 76.2% of hSRT, and 90% of cfSRT (P = .05). There was less transient expansion of tumors treated with cfSRT (5%) than with SRS (53.3%) or hSRT (28.6%) (P = .005). The median time to regression was 13.8 months for SRS, 14.2 months for hSRT, and 5.5 months for cfSRT (P = .34). There was a 3.6% incidence of grade 3 trigeminal neuropathy, but there was no grade 3 facial neuropathy.CONCLUSIONS: All 3 regimens demonstrated similar excellent local control with minimal toxicity; however, the ability of hSRT to treat larger tumors with comparable outcomes to SRS and greater patient convenience when compared with cfSRT suggest that hSRT may offer the optimal treatment approach.",Excluded

The total neurite length for PC12 cells grown on the Kr(+)-irradiated film was the longest; the neurite length on the film irradiated by Kr(+) after 9 days was approximately five times longer than that for cells grown on the He(+)-irradiated film, i.e., 135 micro m. In addition, the PC12 differentiation rate on the ion-irradiated polyimide films also showed a similar trend to the total neurite length for PC12 cells cultured on the films: the rate decreased in the order Kr(+) > Ne(+) > He(+). This initial study indicated enhanced neurite outgrowth and differentiation of PC12 cells on fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation.",Excluded
824,"Toxicity profile of spine stereotactic radiosurgery among long-term survivors. Purpose/Objective(s): To characterize toxicity risk profiles in long-term survivors (>4 years) after spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS). Long-term oncologic control outcomes have been previously reported. This study represents the largest series reporting long-term toxicity profiles after SSRS. Materials/Methods: From December 2002 to June 2011, 228 patients with 261 segments were treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic disease. A subset cohort of 53 patients with 59 segments survived a minimum of 4 years after treatment and was analyzed for radiation associated toxicity. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 were used to grade myelopathy, myelitis, radiculopathy, and fracture. Toxicity endpoints occurring in the setting of tumor progression were not attributed to treatment effect. Toxicity development was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Patients were followed clinically and radiographically for a median of 5.6 years (range 49-110 months). SSRS fractionation schemes were 24 Gy in 1 fraction (25%), 18 Gy in 1 fraction (19%), 27 Gy in 3 fractions (32%), 30 Gy in 5 fractions (11%), 16 Gy in 1 fraction (11%), or 22 Gy in 1 fraction (2%). There were 6 sites treated which received prior conventional radiation (10.2%). Three patients (5%) required additional surgery due to tumor progression while 8 (13.6%) received additional palliative radiation. Long-term treatment related toxicity events included one case of Grade 4 myelopathy resulting in hemi-cord syndrome (1.7%), which occurred 13 months after therapy. Sensory radiculopathy occurred in 5 cases (8.5%) at a median of 12.8 months (range 2.5-25.4), of which, 2 required intrathecal pain pumps for symptom management. Eight treated segments (13.6%) involving 7 patients developed vertebral body collapse and/or endplate fracture at a median 7.5 months (range 0.6-49.2) with 6 (10.2%) requiring either percutaneous vertebroplasty or surgery. Overall, in this subset cohort of long-term survivors, a toxicity event was observed in 15 cases (25%) of which 9 (15%) were at least grade 3. The majority of events (53%) were vertebral fracture. Forty percent of toxicity occurred beyond 12 months of therapy (median 10 months) with events being observed beyond 2 years (radiculopathy) and even 4 years (vertebral fracture) later. Combined grade 3+ neurological toxicity occurred in 5.6% of long-term survivors at a median of 12.7 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Spine stereotactic radiosurgery appears to have a favorable late toxicity profile even amongst a selected cohort of long-term survivors. The overwhelming majority of events occur within 2 years of treatment. Very late toxicity beyond 4 years occurred in 1/59 treated sites and consisted of a vertebral body fracture. There were no very late neurological toxicities beyond 4 years. Overall, these data support the durable safety of the technique.",Excluded
466,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded
1825,"Creation of endothelial-targeted adenoviral vectors for genetic engineering of the metastatic tumor microenvironment. The endothelium is an attractive gene therapy target for metastatic cancer, providing access to systemic tumors. Previous work has focused on either viral entry/attachment (transductional targeting), or cell type specific enhancer promoter vector transgene expression regulation (transcriptional targeting). While previous studies demonstrated endothelial targeting, the tumor wide extent and transgene expression level quantification have been uncertain. Indeed, obtaining robust and stringent tumor expression has been challenging due to: insufficient transduction, focal rather than widespread intratumoral vascular expression, viral particle liver sequestration, and host preformed immunity. We developed a set of adenoviral vectors, containing 3 kb of the human ROBO4 enhancer/promoter, that are expressed at high levels throughout tumor vasculature. We now have three vectors representing four tiers of genetic modification. Transgenes encoding fluorescent proteins allowed us to quantify endothelial expression frequency by image analysis, and expression level using whole tissue Western blotting. Our first vector was Ad5.ROBO4. Compared with Ad5.CMV, Ad5.ROBO4 evidenced complete retargeting from hepatocytes to low-level expression in host organ and tumor endothelial cells. Warfarin-mediated hepatocyte detargeting produced a striking increase in tumor and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial expression, without change in other host organs. Our second vector is Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4. Insertion of a cyclized RGD peptide in the fiber/knob HI loop engages enhanced tumor endothelial transduction via alphav/beta3 and alphav/beta5. Swapping hexon hypervariable regions responsible for Ad Type 5-Factor X binding with corresponding regions from serotype 3 enables marked diminution of hepatocyte sequestration. Use of the ROBO4 enhancer promoter produces high-level pan-intratumoral vascular expression particularly in cancers with markedly elevated VEGF production, such as orthotopic and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, orthotopic colonic liver metastases, and prostate cancer bone, brain, and liver metastases. Most striking, was enhancement of Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4 vector expression within interior tumor regions undergoing hypoxic necrosis; regions notoriously resistant to radiation or chemotherapies. Our third vector contains a polycistronic array, enabling triple transgene expression from a single vector within the tumor vasculature. Thus, we have panel of endothelial-targeted vectors with distinctive vascular tropism for use in cancers metastatic to individual host organs. These vectors enable expression of a palette of transgenes that can manipulate the tumor microenvironment to achieve metastatic growth inhibition alone, or ""staggered"" with chemo- or irradiation therapies.",Excluded
816,"Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma: the next step. PURPOSE: The use of preradiotherapy (RT) methotrexate (MTX) has improved disease control and survival in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). The reported protocol was designed to optimize and enhance the chemotherapeutic component of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated with five cycles of high-dose MTX 3.5 g/m(2), procarbazine 100 mg/m(2)/d, and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2). Thirty patients received whole-brain RT (45 Gy). Twenty-two older patients deferred RT to diminish the risk of delayed neurotoxicity; these patients are compared with 12 older patients who completed the entire treatment regimen. Most patients (n = 35) received high-dose cytarabine after RT.RESULTS: Objective response rate to the induction chemotherapy regimen was 90%; overall median survival is 60 months. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was seen in 30 patients, primarily in association with cytarabine; grade 3 nephrotoxicity due to MTX was seen in two patients. Older patients had similar median survival with or without the addition of RT: 32 versus 33 months, respectively. However, late neurotoxicity was significantly more common in those older patients who received RT (P: =.00004). Patients younger than 60 years who received the complete treatment regimen have not reached median disease-free or overall survival.CONCLUSION: Increasing the dose of MTX and adding procarbazine and vincristine improved disease control and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL. Younger patients in particular fared extremely well with this treatment regimen. In older patients, deferring whole-brain RT did not compromise overall survival but did reduce treatment-related toxicity.",Excluded
2826,"Should computed tomography coronary angiography be aborted when the calcium score exceeds a certain threshold in patients with chest pain?. BACKGROUND: There is ongoing debate about whether a computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) should be aborted when the calcium score (CS) exceeds a certain threshold in patients with chest pain. The aim of this study was to discover whether specific ""cutpoints"" regarding coronary artery CS could be determined to predict severe coronary stenoses assessed by CTCA, thus identifying patients amenable to an invasive diagnostic approach.METHODS: 294 consecutive patients with chest pain of uncertain cause who were referred for non-invasive diagnostic CTCA were included. Subjects underwent Agatston CS and CTCA using current 64-slice technology.RESULTS: Severe coronary stenoses were noted in 75 of 294 (25.1%) patients on CTCA. A very high prevalence of severe coronary stenoses was found in patients with CS >= 400 (87.0%). The CS had area under the ROC curve 0.86 to predict severe coronary stenoses on CTCA. The best discriminant cut-off point was CS >= 400 (sensitivity of 55.3%, specificity of 93.5, positive predictive value of 85.8%, negative predictive value of 84.0%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for traditional risk factors showed CS >= 400 remained an independent predictor of severe coronary stenoses on CTCA (OR 14.553, 95% confidence interval 4.043 to 52.384, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: CS can be used as a ""gatekeeper"" to CTCA in patients with chest pain. Due to the very high prevalence of severe coronary stenoses in patients with CS >= 400, further evaluation with CTCA is not warranted as these patients should be referred to invasive coronary angiography, avoiding the repeated exposure to ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast.",Excluded
2489,"F43polygenic Risk of Major Depressive Disorder Is Associated with White Matter Microstructure: Evidence from Uk Biobank Imaging Study of 9,748 Participants. Background: Previous cohort studies have shown that the onset of Major depressive disorder (MDD) is related to alterations in white matter microstructure in the brain, especially in the tracts that involve in emotional processes such as the thalamic radiations. Earlier attempts to identify any associations between MDD polygenic risk (MDD-pgrs) and white matter microstructure have so far been heterogeneous. In the present study, we used the polygenic risk scores created based on the summary statistics from PGC and the imaging data from UK Biobank (N= 9,748) to test for an association between brain structural connectivity and MDD genetic risk. Method(s): We used IDPs (imaging-derived phenotypes) from UK Biobank imaging project. The imaging data was collected on a single scanner and preprocessed in FSL by UK Biobank. 15 major white matter tracts were extracted. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were used as measures for white matter microstructure (higher integrity is associated with higher FA or lower MD). Regression models were applied to test the associations of MDD or MDD-pgrs with white matter microstructure. All effect sizes reported were significant after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing. Result(s): At MDD-pgrs threshold of pT<0.01, MDD-pgrs was associated with a general factor of global white matter microstructure for both FA and MD (FA: beta=-0.027, p=4.51e-3; MD: beta=0.034, p=2.53e-4). At this same threshold, we found a significant association between MDD-pgrs and lower FA in the medial lemniscus (beta=-0.034, pcorrected=7.12e-4), superior thalamic radiation (beta=-0.031, pcorrected=8.79e-3), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (beta=-0.034, pcorrected=7.12e-4), forceps major (beta=-0.026, pcorrected=0.027), and forceps minor (beta=-0.025, pcorrected=0.027). For MD, all the above tracts were significant (beta ranged from 0.018 to 0.034, pcorrected ranged from 4.28e-4 to 0.013), apart from the medial lemniscus. In addition, several additional tracts also showed significant associations with MD, including the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus, and acoustic radiation (beta ranged from 0.025 to 0.039, pcorrected ranged from 4.28e-3 to 0.047). Discussion(s): MDD-pgrs at the pT<0.01 was associated with reduced white matter microstructure in UKB participants. Significant results were found at other thresholds, but the pT<0.01 showed the most significant and anatomically widespread associations. Results from the latest MDD GWAS that showed the top hits and pathways are mostly associated with neuronal processes. Our findings indicate that the neuronal pathways impacted in MDD may have downstream effects on white matter microstructure. Disclosure: Nothing to disclose. Copyright Â© 2018",Excluded
743,"Measurements and models of electric fields in the in vivo human brain during transcranial electric stimulation. Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp. However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with in vivo intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials.",Excluded
86,"Opposite effects of tetanic stimulation of the auditory thalamus or auditory cortex on the acoustic startle reflex in awake rats. The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle. The lateral amygdala nucleus (LA) receives auditory inputs from both the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus; MGN) and auditory association cortex (AAC), and is critical for auditory fear conditioning. The central amygdala nucleus, which has intra-amygdaloid connections with LA, enhances startle magnitude via midbrain connections to the startle circuits. Tetanic stimulation of either MGN or AAC in vitro or in vivo can induce long-term potentiation in LA. In the present study, behavioural consequences of tetanization of these auditory afferents were investigated in awake rats. The acoustic startle reflex of rats was enhanced by tetanic stimulation of MGN, but suppressed by that of AAC. All the tetanization-induced changes of startle diminished within 24 h. Blockade of GABAB receptors in the LA area reversed the suppressive effect of tetanic stimulation of AAC on startle but did not change the enhancing effect of tetanic stimulation of MGN. Moreover, transient electrical stimulation of MGN enhanced the acoustic startle reflex when it lagged behind acoustic stimulation, but inhibited the acoustic startle reflex when it preceded acoustic stimulation. The results of the present study indicate that MGN and AAC afferents to LA play different roles in emotional modulation of startle, and AAC afferents are more influenced by inhibitory GABAB transmission in LA.",Excluded
2970,"Preliminary Results of Emergency Computed Tomography-Guided Ventricular Drain Placement-Precision for the Most Difficult Cases. Background: External ventricular drainage (EVD) catheter placement is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. The study's objective was to compare a computed tomography (CT) bolt scan-guided approach for the placement of EVDs with conventional landmark-based insertion. Method(s): In this retrospective case-control study, we analyzed patients undergoing bolt-kit EVD catheter placement, either CT-guided or landmark-based, between 2013 and 2016. The CT bolt scan-guided approach was based on a dose-reduced CT scan after bolt fixation with immediate image reconstruction along the axis of the bolt to evaluate the putative insertion axis. If needed, angulation of the bolt was corrected and the procedure repeated before the catheter was inserted. Primary endpoint was the accuracy of insertion. Secondary endpoints were the overall number of attempts, duration of intervention, complication rates, and cumulative radiation dose. Result(s): In total, 34 patients were included in the final analysis. In the group undergoing CT-guided placement, the average ventricle width was significantly smaller (P = 0.04) and average midline shift significantly more pronounced (P = 0.01). CT-guided placement resulted in correct positioning of the catheter in the ipsilateral frontal horn in all 100% of the cases compared with landmark-guided insertion (63%; P = 0.01). Application of the CT-guided approach increased the number of total CT scans (3.6 +/- 1.9) and the overall radiation dose (3.34 +/- 1.61 mSv) compared with the freehand insertion group (1.84 +/- 2.0 mSv and 1.55 +/- 1.66 mSv). No differences were found for the other secondary outcome parameters. Conclusion(s): CT-guided bolt-kit EVD catheter placement is feasible and accurate in the most difficult cases.

2787,"Opsin co-expression in Limulus photoreceptors: differential regulation by light and a circadian clock. A long-standing concept in vision science has held that a single photoreceptor expresses a single type of opsin, the protein component of visual pigment. However, the number of examples in the literature of photoreceptors from vertebrates and invertebrates that break this rule is increasing. Here, we describe a newly discovered Limulus opsin, Limulus opsin5, which is significantly different from previously characterized Limulus opsins, opsins1 and 2. We show that opsin5 is co-expressed with opsins1 and 2 in Limulus lateral and ventral eye photoreceptors and provide the first evidence that the expression of co-expressed opsins can be differentially regulated. We show that the relative levels of opsin5 and opsin1 and 2 in the rhabdom change with a diurnal rhythm and that their relative levels are also influenced by the animal's central circadian clock. An analysis of the sequence of opsin5 suggests it is sensitive to visible light (400-700 nm) but that its spectral properties may be different from that of opsins1 and 2. Changes in the relative levels of these opsins may underlie some of the dramatic day-night changes in Limulus photoreceptor function and may produce a diurnal change in their spectral sensitivity.",Excluded
3626,"Combination of pGL1-TNF-alpha gene and radiation (proton and gamma-ray) therapy against brain tumor. The major goal of this study was to determine if treatment with the newly constructed plasmid vector for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (pGL1-TNF-alpha) could enhance the radiation-induced growth reduction of C6 rat glioma. In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment. Overall, the results suggest that the pGL1-TNF-alpha/radiation combination is effective and safe under the conditions employed. This is the first study to combine gene and proton radiation therapy and to show, under controlled experimental conditions, that proton radiation may have a greater effect against malignant tumors compared to the same physical dose of gamma-radiation.",Excluded

572,"NAD(+) maintenance attenuates light induced photoreceptor degeneration. Light-induced retinal damage (LD) occurs after surgery or sun exposure. We previously showed that zinc (Zn(2+)) accumulated in photoreceptors and RPE cells after LD but prior to cell death, and pyruvate or nicotinamide attenuated the resultant death perhaps by restoring nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) levels. We first examined the levels of NAD(+) and the efficacy of pyruvate or nicotinamide in oxidative toxicities using primary retinal cultures. We next manipulated NAD(+) levels in vivo and tested the affect on LD to photoreceptors and RPE. NAD(+) levels cycle with a 24-h rhythm in mammals, which is affected by the feeding schedule. Therefore, we tested the affect of increasing NAD(+) levels on LD by giving nicotinamide, inverting the feeding schedule, or using transgenic mice which overexpress cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyl-transferase-1 (cytNMNAT1), an NAD(+) synthetic enzyme. Zn(2+) accumulation was also assessed in culture and in retinal sections. Retinas of light damaged animals were examined by OCT and plastic sectioning, and retinal NAD(+) levels were measured. Day fed, or nicotinamide treated rats showed less NAD(+) loss, and LD compared to night fed rats or untreated rats without changing the Zn(2+) staining pattern. CytNMNAT1 showed less Zn(2+) staining, NAD(+) loss, and cell death after LD. In conclusion, intense light, Zn(2+) and oxidative toxicities caused an increase in Zn(2+), NAD(+) loss, and cell death which were attenuated by NAD(+) restoration. Therefore, NAD(+) levels play a protective role in LD-induced death of photoreceptors and RPE cells.",Excluded
2037,"Effects of 900 MHz radiofrequency on corticosterone, emotional memory and neuroinflammation in middle-aged rats. The widespread use of mobile phones raises the question of the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF, 900 MHz) on the brain. Previous studies reported increased levels of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the rat's brain after a single exposure to 900 MHz global system for mobile (GSM) signal, suggesting a potential inflammatory process. While this result was obtained in adult rats, no data is currently available in older animals. Since the transition from middle-age to senescence is highly dependent on environment and lifestyle, we studied the reactivity of middle-aged brains to EMF exposure. We assessed the effects of a single 15 min GSM exposure (900 MHz; specific absorption rate (SAR)=6 W/kg) on GFAP expression in young adults (6 week-old) and middle-aged rats (12 month-old). Brain interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, plasmatic levels of corticosterone (CORT), and emotional memory were also assessed. Our data indicated that, in contrast to previously published work, acute GSM exposure did not induce astrocyte activation. Our results showed an IL-1beta increase in the olfactory bulb and enhanced contextual emotional memory in GSM-exposed middle-aged rats, and increased plasmatic levels of CORT in GSM-exposed young adults. Altogether, our data showed an age dependency of reactivity to GSM exposure in neuro-immunity, stress and behavioral parameters.

Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance allow only an approximate estimation of the GFR. The aim of this study was an accurate assessment of long -term changes in GFR using the 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Of particular interest was the impact of pre-existing risk factors. Methods : GFR of 75 patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octreotate (4 intended cycles at 3 monthly intervals and mean activity of 7.9 GBq per cycle) were retrospectively analyzed. A minimum follow-up of 12 months was required for patient inclusion. Mean followup duration was 20 months (range 12-48 months), with a median of 5 GFR measurements per patient. The change of GFR was analyzed by linear curve fit. Potential risk factors including DM, HTN, previous chemotherapy and decreased renal function at baseline were analyzed regarding impact on the renal function loss. Comparability of nephrotoxicity determined by 99mTc-DTPA clearance and serum creatinine (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) was also investigated. Results : A reduction of >2 ml / year in GFR was observed in 31 (42%) and > 10ml/year in 16 patients (22%). The mean and median decline in GFR was 12 and 7 ml per year respectively. However, only one patient developed serious nephrotoxicity (CTCAE grade III). Eleven patients showed an increase of > 10 ml/year in GFR following PRRT. Nephrotoxicity graded according to serum creatinine (CTCAE) was not compatible with GFR in 17% of the assessments and was underestimated by serum creatinine in 12% of patients. None of the investigated risk factors contributed to a reduction in GFR. Conclusions : Severe nephrotoxicity after PRRT with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octrotate is rare (1.3 % of patients).

2148,"Subthalamic Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Parkinson's Disease: A Cautionary Tale. INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reliably improve several symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in appropriately selected patients. Various factors may preclude patients from undergoing DBS and for them, non-invasive lesion-based therapies such as focused ultrasound and Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery may present a safer alternative.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on preliminary positive reports of STN GK for PD, we conducted a prospective, open-label, single-center, pilot study in PD patients deemed potential candidates for unilateral DBS based on their disease characteristics, but contraindicated due to age >74, an irreversible bleeding diathesis, or significant comorbid medical disease. Stereotactic MRI-guided GK radiosurgery was performed using a single 110- or 120-Gy dose targeting the STN contralateral to the more symptomatic extremity. Clinical follow-up and imaging assessed the safety and efficacy of the procedure over a 12-month period.RESULTS: Four PD patients with medication-refractory tremors and disabling dyskinesias underwent unilateral STN GK radiosurgery. Contraindications to DBS included high-risk comorbid cardiovas-cular disease in 3 patients and an irreversible bleeding diathesis in 1. There were no immediate post-procedural adverse events. One patient who underwent left STN GK radiosurgery developed right hemiparesis and dysarthria 7 months post-procedure followed by hospitalization at 9 months for bacterial endocarditis and liver failure from which he died. The remaining 3 patients were free of adverse events up to 12 months post-procedure and experienced a reduction in contralateral rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. Upon extended follow-up, 2 patients developed subacute worsening of gait. One died at 16 months due to complications of a fall whereas the other saw no change in gait up to 42 months post-procedure. All 3 patients with adverse events demonstrated a hyper-response in the targeted area on follow-up neuroimaging.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite the potential for clinical improvement, our results suggest that unilateral STN GK radiosurgery should be approached cautiously in medically frail PD patients who may be at higher risk of GK hyper-response and neurologic complications.",Excluded

After the treatment, no significant difference was found for RR among groups (P=0.245), however, patients in the Ce group showed the highest cognitive function score (P<0.001); the differences in adverse reactions including dry mouth (P=0.026, Ce vs. H; P=0.000, Ce vs. I; P=0.000, H vs. I), oral mucositis (P=0.060, Ce vs. H; P=0.008, Ce vs. I; P=0.396, H vs. I), skin reaction (P=0.654, Ce vs. H; P=0.027, Ce vs. I; P=0.065, H vs. I), irradiation otitis media (P=0.097, Ce vs. H; P=0.009, Ce vs. I; P=0.051, H vs. I) had statistical significance, and their incidence rates in Ce group were lowest. Meanwhile, recurrence and metastasis were less in the Ce group although the differences were insignificant (P=0.302 and 0.638). The serum level of CEA was notably lower in Ce group (P=0.031, Ce vs. H; P=0.020, Ce vs. I; P=0.512, H vs. I). Life quality scores about cognitive function and role function of H group and Ce group were higher than that of I group while Ce group was the highest (Cognitive function: P=0.020, Ce vs. H; P=0.015, Ce vs. I and P=0.023, H vs. I; role function: P=0.039, Ce vs. H; P=0.011, Ce vs. I and P=0.031, H vs. I).

2844,"Thiol activation of endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15. A novel mechanism for the regulation of catalytic activity. Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) is a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides. Unlike other thermolysin-like peptidases EP24.15 displays a unique thiol activation, a mechanism that is not clearly understood. In this study we show that both recombinant and tissue-derived EP24.15 are activated up to 8-fold by low concentrations (0.1 mM) of dithiothreitol. Additionally, under non-reducing conditions, recombinant and native EP24.15 forms multimers that can be returned to the monomeric form by reduction. We have also shown that competitive inhibitor binding occurs only to the monomeric form, which indicates that catalytic site access is restricted in the multimeric forms. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis we have identified that cysteine residues 246, 253, and possibly 248 are involved in the formation of these multimers. Furthermore, both a double mutant (C246S/C253S) and a triple mutant (C246S/C248S/C253S) are fully active in the absence of reducing agents, as measured by both inhibitor binding and hydrolysis. The formation and disruption of disulfide bonds involving these cysteine residues may be a mechanism by which EP24.15 activity is regulated through changes in intra- and extracellular redox potential.",Excluded

920,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme: The First Experiences in the Czech Republic. [Slovak]. Background. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its treatment remains unsatisfactory with very limited overall survival. In the year 2001, in cooperation with Department of Neurosurgery, Nemocnice Na Homolce and Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, we have started to treat glioblastoma patients with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Methods and Results. Cells of malignant brain tumors, especially that of glioblastomas, are able to accumulate boron compounds. If BNCT should be successful, it is necessary to reach selective accumulation of sufficient amount of 10B in the tumor and low accumulation in the normal brain tissue. After BSH administration, radiation with low energy thermal neutrons is delivered. It results in nuclear capture and fission reactions with subsequent selective damage of tumor cells. At the time of analysis 9 patients have been enrolled. Therapy was completed in 5 patients. Treatment has been very well tolerated. We observed minimal acute toxicity associated with radiation and no laboratory abnormalities after administrations of BSH. Unfortunately treatment results were quite unsatisfactory. The median time to progression and overall survival were shorter then expected with conventional treatment. Conclusions. BNCT is very well tolerated with only a modest toxicity. In contrast to standard radiation, BNCT patients receive only one dose of radiation. Nevertheless, in this small pilot study first results were inferior when compared either to outcomes of conventional therapy or to results reported from other BNCT groups. It might be explained that lower dose of radiation had been used. Further study will show whether the higher dose radiation can improve treatment results.",Excluded

1689,"Glioblastoma Treatment with Temozolomide and Bevacizumab and Overall Survival in a Rural Tertiary Healthcare Practice. Background. The efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), a primary brain tumor with short survival, was demonstrated in a clinical trial in 2005, and since then, the standard-of-care for newly diagnosed GBM has been maximal safe surgery followed by 60 Gray of radiation with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ (standard radiotherapy and TMZ). In 2009, clinical trials also reported on the efficacy of bevacizumab for treating recurrent GBM. We performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of treatment regimens on overall survival for patients with GBM at a rural tertiary healthcare practice. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 307 consecutive, newly diagnosed GBM patients at one institution between 1995 and 2012 and assessed treatment patterns. We also compared overall survival according to the treatment received. Results. Only 0.6% (1/163) of patients diagnosed before 2005 received standard radiotherapy and TMZ versus 36.1% (52/144) of patients diagnosed since 2005 (P < 0.0001). For patients who received standard radiotherapy and TMZ, the median overall survival was 17.0 months versus 7.0 months for patients who received 60 Gray of radiation but no chemotherapy (P = 0.0000078). The median overall survival was 15.4 months in the 19 patients treated with bevacizumab monotherapy at first GBM recurrence versus 6.8 months in the 32 patients with no treatment at first GBM recurrence (P = 0.00015), but patients who received bevacizumab were younger and more likely to have had a surgical resection and 60 Gray of radiation at diagnosis. Conclusions. TMZ and bevacizumab therapies were rapidly adopted in a rural tertiary healthcare setting, and patients who received these treatments had increased overall survival. However, advantageous prognostic factors in patients who received bevacizumab at recurrence may have influenced the extent of the increase in overall survival attributed to this treatment.

2168,"Exercise as a countermeasure to psycho-physiological deconditioning during long-term confinement. Confinement studies are performed to simulate the psychological effects that may be experienced on a long-term space flight. A general psycho-physiological model assumes that mood and cognitive functioning are impaired during confinement as a result of an absence of physical activity. The aim of the MARS500 study initiated by the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) and the European Space Agency (ESA) is to gather data, knowledge and experience to help prepare for a real mission to Mars. A test run with 105 days of isolation was performed prior to 520 days of isolation. Psycho-physiological data of this study are presented here. We hypothesized that exercise, as it has been shown in laboratory settings, would be able to prevent and counteract mood changes during isolation. Electrocortical data (EEG) and a self report on current psychological and physical state were recorded several times prior to and after exercise during the isolation period. Data revealed a clear effect of exercise on mood and electrocortical activity. Moreover, it was shown that mood and brain cortical activity decreased during the first 11 weeks of isolation and reached baseline again in the last week of isolation. A correlation analysis revealed a significant relation between mood data and electrocortical activity. We conclude (1) that confinement is accompanied by psycho-physiological changes and (2) that exercise is a suitable method to counteract psycho-physiological deconditioning during confinement.",Excluded

However, most radiochemistry labs have limited capability to produce a second or even multiple <sup>11</sup>C-radiochemistry runs within the same day. Thus, we have re-configured two commercial radiosynthesis modules, the TRACERLab FXC Pro module (GE Healthcare) and the Auto-Loop 11CMethylation System (Eckert & Ziegler) to perform efficient and reliable multiple radiochemistry procedures of [11 C]DPA-713 and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride for clinical use on the same day. Method(s): Two 3-way valves were installed on the FXC Pro module to connect with the Auto-Loop system for transferring either [<sup>11</sup>C]MeI or [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF for their respective reactions (See Figure 1). [<sup>11</sup>C]CH<inf>3</inf>I and [<sup>11</sup>C]CH3 OTF were produced in FXC Pro from cyclotron delivered [<sup>11</sup>C]CO<inf>2</inf> via reduction, iodination, and triflation. Further methylation with the prosthetic group in the FXC Pro: 1.0 mg of precursor (for [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride) with NaOH was dissolved in 0.4 mL acetone in the reactor. After the C-11 methylation reaction was complete, the mixture was injected onto the HPLC for purification. Auto-Loop System: 1.0 mg of precursor (for [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [11 C]raclopride) with NaOH were dissolved in 0.1 mL of 2-butanone then pre-loaded onto 2 mL loop. After [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF was trapped and reacted in the loop for 2 min, the crude mixture was injected onto HPLC for purification. Collected [11 C]DPA-713 and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride was formulated by a C18 light solid phase extraction process, eluted by ethanol, saline and filtrated through sterile GV filter. Final product quality control was performed and passed all set criteria detailed in the respective IND application approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Result(s): Radiosynthesis on both the FXC Pro and Auto-Loop System were accomplished successfully and showed reliable radiochemical yields and molar activity. (See Figure 1). The final products met all categories of quality controls criteria (pH, appearance, filter integrity test, radiochemical purity, chemical purity, endotoxin, bacteria culture test and residual organic solvent) under USP 823. The newly installed two 3-way valves were remotely operated and can easily distribute [<sup>11</sup>C]MeI or [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF either to the reactor in FXC Pro or the capillary loop in Auto-Loop System. FXC Pro can stand alone for first <sup>11</sup>C-radioparmaceutical and be quickly switched to Auto-Loop System for next 11Cradiochemistry afterward. Furthermore, there is less radiation exposure to the radiochemist when he/she is using Auto-Loop System - thus, the use of the Auto-Loop will provide a safer option when the daily <sup>11</sup>C-production frequency increases. Currently, our facility can produce 3 clinical grade of [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride on the same day but expect this number to increase in the near future.

The energy storage and the molecular rearrangements due to the primary photochemical event in rhodopsin are investigated by using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics hybrid methods in conjunction with high-resolution structural data of bovine visual rhodopsin. The analysis of the reactant and product molecular structures reveals the energy storage mechanism as determined by the detailed molecular rearrangements of the retinyl chromophore, including rotation of the (C11-C12) dihedral angle from -11 degrees in the 11-cis isomer to -161 degrees in the all-trans product, where the preferential sense of rotation is determined by the steric interactions between Ala-117 and the polyene chain at the C13 position, torsion of the polyene chain due to steric constraints in the binding pocket, and stretching of the salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base and the Glu-113 counterion by reorientation of the polarized bonds that localize the net positive charge at the Schiff-base linkage. The energy storage, computed at the ONIOM electronic-embedding approach (B3LYP/6-31G*:AMBER) level of theory and the S0-->S1 electronic-excitation energies for the dark and product states, obtained at the ONIOM electronic-embedding approach (TD-B3LYP/6-31G*//B3LYP/6-31G*:AMBER) level of theory, are in very good agreement with experimental data.

3063,"Monitoring of mental performance during spaceflight. Mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight may suffer from both direct effects of microgravity on perceptual, cognitive, and psychomotor processes, and unspecific stress effects on these functions due to high workload sleep disturbances, or the general burden of adapting to the extreme living conditions in space. Early detection of any signs of mental performance impairments seems to be essential for mission success and to prevent obvious performance decrements in critical mission tasks. One possible approach to this problem is to assess the astronaut's performance on specific screening tests repeatedly during a space mission and to compare the results with a self-referenced baseline established pre-flight. The selection of screening tests for this purpose should be guided by three different criteria: 1) their reliability; 2) their sensitivity (i.e., their power to reveal subtle mental performance changes induced by internal or external stressors during spaceflight); and 3) their diagnosticity (i.e., their capability to reveal the underlying processes that lead to these performance deficits). Based on a discussion of these theoretical issues, first attempts to monitor mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight by means of short-term laboratory tasks are reviewed. The results of these studies suggest that, in particular, perceptual-motor tasks (tracking) and tasks placing comparatively high demands on attentional processes (e.g., dual-tasks) represent sensitive monitoring measures. First studies on the diagnositicity of tracking performance decrements during spaceflight suggest that they reflect both microgravity-related changes in the sensory-motor system as well as unspecific stress-effects, with the former factor reflected primarily in tracking performance decrements during early adaptation to the microgravity environment.

1949,"Laser irradiation activates spinal adenosine A1 receptor to alleviate osteoarthritis pain in monosodium iodoacetate injected rats. The analgesic role of the adenosine A1 receptor is thought to involve the modulation of the spinal N-methyl D-aspartate receptor-mediated nociceptive pathway, which is suggested to be an underlying mechanism in chronic pain. Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition accompanied by chronic pain. We have demonstrated that 10.6-mum laser irradiation has an antinociceptive effect in the monosodium iodoacetate -induced knee osteoarthritis in rats. However, its mechanism of action has yet to be explored. In the present work, we investigate the mechanism of 10.6-mum laser irradiation mediated antinociception in the monosodium iodoacetate -induced knee osteoarthritis. Results showed that the 10.6-mum laser significantly reversed the monosodium iodoacetate -induced nociceptive behaviors for up to 28 days. Moreover, the up-regulation of the A1 receptor and the down-regulated phosphorylation of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1 subunit of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor were observed in the spinal cord dorsal horn in the monosodium iodoacetate injected rats treated by laser irradiation. Intrathecal injection of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine markedly reversed the effects of laser irradiation, as evidenced both by behavioral pain tests and by levels of spinal phosphorylation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1. These results suggest that the spinal A1 receptor contributes to the antinociceptive effects of 10.6-mum laser, at least in part by inhibiting phosphorylation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1 in the monosodium iodoacetate -induced knee osteoarthritis pain.",Excluded

2742,"Magnetic resonance imaging associates with differences in neurocognitive performance for cancer survivors complaining of cognitive deficits following brain irradiation. BACKGROUND: Following brain irradiation, roughly 50% of cancer survivors develop some higher-order neurocognitive impairment that does not resolve and can decline further into dementia. However, predicting those who will develop cognitive impairment following therapy is not currently possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers from clinical scans may provide candidate biomarkers related to cognitive performance. METHOD(S): Baseline MRI scans and neurocognitive scores were collected from 198 participants enrolled in CCWFU91105 (NCT#00369785) prior to randomization. Subjects self-reported cognitive difficulties and were at least 6 months post-therapy. At minimum, a T1-weighted MRI pre- and post-gadolinium contrast was requested to confirm stable disease in all participants. Additional scans, including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and T2-weighted MRI scans, were available for analysis in subgroups of participants. Significance was assessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) with a family-wise error correction of p < 0.05. RESULT(S): Because of the vast variability in scan protocols, consistent whole-brain imaging (ie, no skip) was found in 50% of post-contrast T1-weighted scans. From these, local gray and white matter volumes were determined. Increased processing speed was associated with increased volume of white matter in the Muratoff bundle (i.e., subcallosal fasciculus), whereas increased verbal fluency was associated with increased white matter in the corpus callosum, left frontal horn, and bilateral cerebellum. Subgroup analysis of other modality scans (as available: FLAIR and diffusion-weighted) supported these findings. Perfusion of gray matter did not correlate with neurocognitive function in the sub-group receiving pulse arterial spin labeling scans. CONCLUSION(S): Variance in brain structure correlated with performance differences on several neurocognitive tests and indicated a strong association between white matter integrity and maintenance of cognitive function in cancer survivors following brain irradiation. Whether a prospective trial from a pretreatment baseline will find white matter integrity to be predictive of postradiotherapy cognitive function remains to be seen.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The incorporation of three-dimensional (3D) planning for the treatment of bone metastases has been embraced in many North American practices with assumed superior tumor targeting, sparing of normal structures, and improvement in patient outcomes. The goal of our project was to evaluate the dosimetric and clinical impact of 3D vs. two-dimensional (2D) planning for patients who require simple palliative radiotherapy techniques (<= 2 beams) for bone metastases.METHODS: Patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for bone metastases were eligible. The study oncologists first documented the intended treatment target, defined the treatment target/field using digital radiographs (2D), followed by using full 3D planning computerized tomography volumetric datasets. Treatment plans were compared dosimetrically, and patient-reported outcomes (pain, fatigue, anorexia, and nausea) were compared against a historical cohort treated with 2D plans.RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled in the study group. Review of the 3D datasets led to changes in the target area of interest in 44/85 (52 %) of cases, of which 21/85 (25 %) were clinically significant. 3D plans resulted in superior target coverage and normal tissue sparing. There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes however.CONCLUSION: 3D radiotherapy planning resulted in superior treatment plans but we were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit in clinical outcomes.

PURPOSE: Excessive activity of NMDA-type (N-methyl-d-aspartate) glutamatergic channels has been implicated as a mechanism for neuronal injury in neurologic disorders, including glaucoma, and retinal disease. This study was designed to characterize the retinal response to experimental manipulations that mimic features of glutamatergic excitotoxic insult and also to determine whether memantine, an NMDA-type glutamatergic channel blocker, is effective in reversing experimental excitotoxicity.METHODS: Recordings of the electroretinogram (ERG) and spiking activity of single retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were made from rabbit retinas. Excitotoxic insult was induced by either (1) application of NMDA, a selective NMDA receptor agonist; (2) application of TBOA (dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid), a selective inhibitor of glutamate transporters, or (3) perfusion with magnesium-free medium. For each condition, memantine was coapplied to determine its efficacy for reversal of experimental excitotoxicity. Memantine was also applied in isolation to characterize any effect on retinal responses to light stimuli.RESULTS: All three experimental manipulations were associated with an increase in the tonic level of RGC spiking activity, a reduction in RGC spike amplitude, and, in some cells, block of spike generation. Experimental excitotoxicity had little or no effect on ERG responses. Coapplication of memantine was associated with recovery of RGC tonic spiking activity and spike amplitude toward control levels. Application of memantine in isolation was associated with a dose-dependent effect on the timing of ERG and RGC-OFF responses.CONCLUSIONS: Memantine was effective in reversing acute experimental excitotoxicity at concentrations that have little effect on retinal light signaling.",Excluded

Dialysate samples were analyzed to measure the amount of 5-HIAA by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using electrochemical detection. Results showed that ELF-MF exposure for 15 days, 1 h daily, was not effective in altering the level of 5-HIAA. However, ELF-MF exposure for 15 days, 3 h daily, decreased the level of the 5-HIAA in the raphe nucleus. It can be concluded that ELF-MFs affect the serotonergic system and may be used to treat nervous system diseases. This study is an initial step towards helping cure depression using ELF-MFs.",Excluded
2890,"Seizure control after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: A 25-year experience. OBJECTIVE Seizures are the second-most common presenting symptom in patients with lobar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control. METHODS Patients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up. RESULTS Seizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief. Copyright Â© AANS 2019",Excluded
2299,"Prox1-positive cells monitor and sustain the murine intestinal epithelial cholinergic niche. The enteric neurotransmitter acetylcholine governs important intestinal epithelial secretory and immune functions through its actions on epithelial muscarinic Gq-coupled receptors such as M3R. Its role in the regulation of intestinal stem cell function and differentiation, however, has not been clarified. Here, we find that nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonism in mice as well as epithelial-specific ablation of M3R induces a selective expansion of DCLK1-positive tuft cells, suggesting a model of feedback inhibition. Cholinergic blockade reduces Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cell tracing and cell number. In contrast, Prox1-positive endocrine cells appear as primary sensors of cholinergic blockade inducing the expansion of tuft cells, which adopt an enteroendocrine phenotype and contribute to increased mucosal levels of acetylcholine. This compensatory mechanism is lost with acute irradiation injury, resulting in a paucity of tuft cells and acetylcholine production. Thus, enteroendocrine tuft cells appear essential to maintain epithelial homeostasis following modifications of the cholinergic intestinal niche. Copyright Â© 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

PURPOSE: To report toxicity and overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (hypo-IMRT) with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with newly diagnosed GBM after biopsy or resection and with adequate performance status and organ or bone marrow function were eligible for this study. Patients received postoperative hypo-IMRT to the surgical cavity and residual tumor seen on T1-weighted brain MRI with a 5-mm margin to a total dose of 60 Gy in 10 fractions (6 Gy/fraction) and to the T2 abnormality on T2-weighted MRI with 5-mm margin to 30 Gy in 10 fractions (3 Gy/fraction). Concurrent TMZ was given at 75 mg/m(2)/day for 28 consecutive days. Adjuvant TMZ was given at 150 to 200 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days every 28 days. Toxicities were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were treated, consisting of 14 men, 10 women; a median age of 60.5 years old (range, 27-77 years); and a median Karnofsky performance score of 80 (range, 60-90). All patients received hypo-IMRT and concurrent TMZ according to protocol, except for 2 patients who received only 14 days of concurrent TMZ. The median number of adjuvant TMZ cycles was 6.5 (range, 0-14). With a median follow-up of 14.8 months (range, 2.7-34.2 months) for all patients and a minimum follow-up of 20.6 months for living patients, no instances of grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity were observed. The median OS was 16.6 months (range, 4.1-35.9 months). Six patients underwent repeated surgery for suspected tumor recurrence; necrosis was found in 50% to 100% of the resected specimens.CONCLUSION: In selected GBM patients, 60 Gy hypo-IMRT delivered in 6-Gy fractions over 2 weeks with concurrent and adjuvant TMZ is safe. OS in this small cohort of patients was comparable to that treated with current standard of care therapy.",Excluded
1065,"Mind over (white)matter: A relationship between client change talk and whitematter integrity?. Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method of applying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the assessment of whitemattermicrostructure. DTI is used tomeasure the directional coherence of water molecules (fractional anisotropy: FA) in white matter fiber bundles in the brain. High FA generally indicates greater axonal diameter, axonal density, & myelination. Fiber bundles including the arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, have been linked to language functions (Frederici & Giheran, in press). Given the theorized role of client language in motivational interviewing (Moyers et al., 2009), and the evidence for dierences in brain activity between types of client change language (Houck et al., in press), the goal of the present study was to examine the correlation between FA and measures of client language from MI treatment sessions for alcohol use. DTI was available from9 subjects (M age = 42.4, SD = 13.5 years). Although change talk counts are linked to treatment outcomes, in the present sample these counts were also correlated with age, which has a strong independent relationship with FA. Instead we evaluated a transition probability extracted from sequential coding of MI sessions: the log-transformed odds ratio for the transition between therapist open questions and client change talk (OQ2CT).With both age and OQ2CT in the model, we observed a trend in right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (p = .24) and anterior thalamic radiation (p = .196), as well as an eect in the left cerebellum (p = .05), each indicating a negative relationship between FA and the odds of responding to an open question with change talk. Work with alcohol dependent individuals shows decreased FA in superior cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Pfeferbaum et al., 2009). More recent research comparing current and remitted AUD suggests that these abnormalities are linked to recent drinking (Monnig et al., 2012). It is unlikely that within-session client speech has an immediate and direct eect upon whitematter integrity. Given the negative correlation in these data, amore plausible explanation is that participants with more severe drinking, and concomitantly greater damage to whitematter, aremore likely to describe negative consequences when asked about their drinking. Research with a larger sample and follow-up assessment is necessary before stronger conclusions can be drawn.",Excluded
1607,"Does prophylactic cranial irradiation improve overall survival of elderly patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer?. Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has led to improved overall survival (OS) for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has responded completely to chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. However, whether PCI is indicated for elderly patients remains unclear. Method(s): We reviewed 658 patients with limited-stage SCLC treated in 1986-2009 at a single institution with definitive concurrent chemoradiation to a total radiation dose of 45-70 Gy. Variables investigated for possible association with OS included patient sex, age, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, year of diagnosis and treatment period (1986-1999 vs. 2000-2009), tumor size, radiation dose, cycles of induction chemotherapy, use of intensity-modulated-radiation-therapy (IMRT), and fractionation. Groups were compared with chi-square tests for categorical variables or medians tests for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Result(s): Among 658 patients, 507 patients were <70 years old (Group A) and 151 patients were >=70 years old (Group B). Median survival time was significantly longer in the younger group (25.6 months vs. 20.3 months, P=0.007), but no differences were found in DFS, LRFS, or DMFS time by age. Of the 151 patients aged >=70 years (54 of whom received PCI and 89 did not), those treated in 2000-2009 (vs. 1986-1999) had better brain MFS than those treated in 1986-1999 (P=0.048); those who received PCI had better brain MFS than those who did not (P=0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that among patients aged >=70, receiving PCI, not receiving induction chemotherapy, and local-regional control were associated with fewer brain metastases (for PCI, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.95, P=0.037; for induction chemotherapy, SHR=0.43, 95% CI=0.19-0.96, P=0.039; and for local-regional failure, SHR=0.996, 95% CI=0.993- 0.998, P=0.001). Among patients >=70, receipt of PCI seemed to have been associated with better OS for those with small-volume disease (primary+nodal disease <5 cm, P=0.0545) but not for those with larger-volume disease (P=0.7387). Conclusion(s): Patients aged >=70 years with small-volume limited-stage SCLC seemed to show a benefit in OS from the use of PCI, but those with larger-volume disease did not. Improved brain MFS was associated with use of PCI, no induction chemotherapy, and locoregional control.",Excluded
1783,"Treatment of salivary gland neoplasms with fast neutron radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of fast neutron radiotherapy for the treatment of salivary gland neoplasms.DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.SETTING: University of Washington Cancer Center, Neutron Facility, Seattle.PATIENTS: The medical records of 279 patients treated with curative intent using fast neutron radiotherapy at the University of Washington Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 279 patients, 263 had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment (16 had no evidence of gross residual disease), 141 had tumors of a major salivary gland, and 138 had tumors of minor salivary glands. The median follow-up period was 36 months (range, 1-142 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local-regional control, cause-specific survival, and freedom from metastasis.RESULTS: The 6-year actuarial cause-specific survival rate was 67%. Multivariate analysis revealed that low group stage (I-II) disease, minor salivary sites, lack of skull base invasion, and primary disease were associated with a statistically significant improvement in cause-specific survival. The 6-year actuarial local-regional control rate was 59%. Multivariate analysis revealed size 4 cm or smaller, lack of base of skull invasion, prior surgical resection, and no previous radiotherapy to have a statistically significant improved local-regional control. Sixteen patients without evidence of gross residual disease had a 100% 6-year actuarial local-regional control. The 6-year actuarial freedom from metastasis rate was 64%. Factors associated with decreased development of systemic metastases included negative lymph nodes at the time of treatment and lack of base of skull involvement. The 6-year actuarial rate of development of grade 3 or 4 long-term toxicity (using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer criteria) was 10%. No patient experienced grade 5 toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Neuron radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with salivary gland neoplasms who have gross residual disease and achieves excellent local-regional control in patients without evidence of gross disease.",Excluded
105,"Weiss Lecture. Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair. Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.

411,"Comparison of 3 Tesla proton MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion and MR diffusion for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects. Purpose: To compare 3 Tesla (3T) multi-voxel and single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (MRS), dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI (DSC), and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for distinguishing recurrent glioma from postradiation injury. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed all 3T MRS, DSC and DWI studies performed for suspicion of malignant glioma recurrence between October 2006 and December 2008. Maximum Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr peak-area and peak-height ratios were recorded for both multi-voxel and single-voxel MRS. Maximum cerebral blood volume (CBV) and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were normalized to white matter. Histopathology and clinical-radiologic follow-up served as reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves for each parameter were compared. Result(s): Forty lesions were classified as glioma recurrence (n = 30) or posttreatment effect (n = 10). Diagnostic performance was similar for CBV ratio (AUC = 0.917, P < 0.001), multi-voxel Cho/Cr peak-area (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), and multi-voxel Cho/NAA peak-height (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), while ADC ratio (AUC = 0.726, P = 0.035) did not appear to perform as well. Single-voxel MRS parameters did not reliably distinguish tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Conclusion(s): A 3T DSC and multi-voxel MRS Cho/Cr peak-area and Cho/NAA peak-height appear to outperform DWI for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects. Single-voxel MRS parameters do not appear to distinguish glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects reliably, and therefore should not be used in place of multi-voxel MRS.

Background Whether <sup>18</sup>F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) metrics predict outcome in limited-stage (LS) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has not been well established; most previous reports have only analyzed maximal standardized uptake values (SUV<inf>max</inf>). We investigated multiple pretreatment PET metrics, including SUV<inf>max</inf>, mean SUV (SUV<inf>mean</inf>), total lesion glycolysis, and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in LS-SCLC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and correlated them with survival and disease control outcomes. Patients and Methods All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy and a median radiation dose of 45 Gy. Kaplan-Meier and competing-risks analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of PET metrics with respect to overall survival (OS), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS), and locoregional failure (LRF). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to account for the effect of other clinical factors on outcomes. Results A total of 120 patients with LS-SCLC had analyzable pre-CRT PET/CTs. The median follow up was 34 months. Median OS was 26.9 months. OS was 53.2% at 2 years and 33.1% at 5 years. SUV<inf>max</inf>, SUV<inf>mean</inf>, MTV, and total lesion glycolysis of the primary tumor were not significantly associated with OS, LRF, and DFS on univariate analysis. MTV was significantly associated with DF (P =.024) on univariate but not multivariate analysis. Conclusion This is the largest reported series to date evaluating the prognostic value of baseline PET metrics in LS-SCLC. Neither SUV<inf>max</inf> nor other analyzed PET metrics demonstrated significant correlation with OS or LRF. MTV was correlated with DF and DFS, but this association was no longer significant after adjustment for other clinical factors. This analysis suggests that pretreatment PET scans, even with the use of advanced metrics, do not have independent prognostic value for outcomes in LS-SCLC patients after CRT.

561,"Effects on the photoresponse of calcium buffers and cyclic GMP incorporated into the cytoplasm of retinal rods. It is generally accepted that the light response in retinal rods involves a reduction of ionic permeability (predominantly to Na+) in the plasma membrane of the outer segment and that this is mediated by an internal messenger which diffuses between the disk and plasma membranes. There is controversy, however, over the identity of the diffusible substance; two alternative schemes have received widespread support (for review see refs 1,2). According to the 'calcium hypothesis', light stimulates the release into the cytoplasm of calcium, leading to the blockage of channels which are normally open in darkness, whereas based on the 'cyclic nucleotide hypothesis', cyclic GMP causes the opening of channels in the dark, but is hydrolysed by a light-activated phosphodiesterase. We report here effects of introducing calcium buffers and cyclic GMP into the rod cytoplasm by means of a patch pipette, which seem to be inconsistent with the calcium hypothesis.",Excluded

8,"Partial mitochondrial inhibition causes striatal dopamine release suppression and medium spiny neuron depolarization via H2O2 elevation, not ATP depletion. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a potential causal factor in Parkinson's disease. We show here that acute exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (30-100 nM; 30 min) causes concentration-dependent suppression of single-pulse evoked dopamine (DA) release monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes in guinea pig striatal slices, with no effect on DA content. Suppression of DA release was prevented by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, implicating ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels; however, tissue ATP was unaltered. Because KATP channels can be activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as by low ATP, we examined the involvement of rotenone-enhanced H2O2 generation. Confirming an essential role for H2O2, the inhibition of DA release by rotenone was prevented by catalase, a peroxide-scavenging enzyme. Striatal H2O2 generation during rotenone exposure was examined in individual medium spiny neurons using fluorescence imaging with dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An increase in intracellular H2O2 levels followed a similar time course to that of DA release suppression and was accompanied by cell membrane depolarization, decreased input resistance, and increased excitability. Extracellular catalase markedly attenuated the increase in DCF fluorescence and prevented rotenone-induced effects on membrane properties; membrane changes were also largely prevented by flufenamic acid, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Thus, partial mitochondrial inhibition can cause functional DA denervation via H2O2 and KATP channels, without DA or ATP depletion. Furthermore, amplified H2O2 levels and TRP channel activation in striatal spiny neurons indicate potential sources of damage in these cells. Overall, these novel factors could contribute to parkinsonian motor deficits and neuronal degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.",Excluded

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is present in two-thirds of patients with multiple injuries and in one-third combined with injuries of the extremities. Studies on interactive effects between central and peripheral injuries are scarce due to the absence of clinically relevant models. To meet the demand for ""more-hit"" models, an experimental model of combined neurotrauma (CNT) incorporating a standardized TBI via lateral fluid percussion (LFP) together with a peripheral bone fracture, i.e., tibia fracture, is introduced. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four experimental groups: controls (n = 10), animals with TBI (n = 30), animals with tibia fracture (n = 30), and animals with CNT (n = 30). Morphological aspects of brain and bone injury were analyzed via standard histopathological procedures and x-ray. Trauma-induced neuromotor dysfunction was assessed using a standardized neuroscore. For interactive effects between injuries, we studied the extent and temporal pattern of circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels via immunoassay and callus formation at fracture sites by means of microradiography. LFP produced an ipsilateral lesion with cortical contusion, hemorrhage, mass shift, and neuronal cell loss (adjacent cortex and hippocampus CA-2/-3), along with contralateral neuromotor dysfunction. X-rays confirmed complete fractures in the middle of the bone shaft. The type of injury (P < 0.001) and time (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with increased IL-6 levels. CNT produced the highest IL-6 plasma levels with a maximum peak at 6 h after trauma (P < 0.001). Similarly, callus formation at fracture sites in CNT was significantly increased versus fracture only (P < 0,01). The CNT model mimics a variety of clinically relevant features known from human multiple injury, including TBI, and offers novel approaches for investigation of interactive mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.",Excluded

1153,"Cranial CT with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction: Improved image quality with concomitant radiation dose reduction. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To safeguard patient health, there is great interest in CT radiation-dose reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an iterative-reconstruction algorithm, ASIR, on image-quality measures in reduced-dose head CT scans for adult patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 64-section scanner, we analyzed 100 reduced-dose adult head CT scans at 6 predefined levels of ASIR blended with FBP reconstruction. These scans were compared with 50 CT scans previously obtained at a higher routine dose without ASIR reconstruction. SNR and CNR were computed from Hounsfield unit measurements of normal GM and WM of brain parenchyma. A blinded qualitative analysis was performed in 10 lower-dose CT datasets compared with higher-dose ones without ASIR. Phantom data analysis was also performed. RESULT(S): Lower-dose scans without ASIR had significantly lower mean GM and WM SNR (P = .003) and similar GM-WM CNR values compared with higher routine-dose scans. However, at ASIR levels of 20%-40%, there was no statistically significant difference in SNR, and at ASIR levels of >=60%, the SNR values of the reduced-dose scans were significantly higher (P < .01). CNR values were also significantly higher at ASIR levels of >=40% (P < .01). Blinded qualitative review demonstrated significant improvements in perceived image noise, artifacts, and GM-WM differentiation at ASIR levels >=60% (P < .01). CONCLUSION(S): These results demonstrate that the use of ASIR in adult head CT scans reduces image noise and increases low-contrast resolution, while allowing lower radiation doses without affecting spatial resolution.",Excluded
2466,"Betulinic Acid a Radiosensitizer in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines. Background and Purpose: Betulinic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene, is a new cytotoxic compound active on melanoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. In combination with irradiation it has been shown to have an additive effect on growth inhibition in melanoma cells. In this study, the radiosensitizing effect of betulinic acid on sequential irradiation was investigated in HNSCC cell lines. Material(s) and Method(s): Two HNSCC cell lines, SCC9 and SCC25, were treated with increasing doses of betulinic acid and sequentially irradiated with a single boost of 4 Gy from a conventional radiation source. The cells were counted, the surviving fraction was determined, and colony-forming assays were performed. Result(s): It could be shown that betulinic acid alone inhibits cell survival, affects cell survival additively in combination with irradiation and decreases clonogenic survival in both cell lines when applied alone. Conclusion(s): Betulinic acid could be a promising treatment agent in radioresistant head and neck cancer. A combination of betulinic acid with radiotherapy seems to be beneficial.

2330,"Experimental approaches to radiation-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain. The developing mammalian brain is highly susceptible to ionizing radiation. Significant increases in microcephalus, heterotopic cortical gray matter, and mental retardation have been noted in prenatally exposed survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the highest risk in those exposed during 8-15 weeks after fertilization. This stage corresponds to day 15 of pregnancy for rats and day 13 for mice in terms of brain development. The initial damage produced by radiation at this stage is cell death in the ventricular zone of the brain mantle, the radiosensitive germinal cell population. Disturbances in the production of neuronal germinal cells, and their migration to the cerebral cortex, give rise to malformations of the brain, such as microcephalus, an absent corpus callosum, disorganized cortical architecture, and heterotopic gray matter. Histological abnormalities are produced by about 500 mGy or more, and reduced brain weight is produced by 250 mGy or more. Mitotic delay, on the other hand, in the ventricular cells is caused by 100 mGy or more. A similar threshold level is suggested in human cases in the induction of mental retardation. The lowest doses of X- and gamma-radiation that induce detectable biological effects in rats and mice are around 30 mGy in increasing acute cell death.",Excluded

2522,"Efficacy of simultaneous pericranial and nasoseptal ""double flap"" reconstruction of anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal and endoscopic endonasal approaches. Background: The vascularized pedicled pericranial flap (PCF) has been the traditional method of reconstruction of skull base defects after craniofacial resection of malignant anterior skull base (ASB) lesions. However, flap necrosis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks can occur after radiation therapy. The ""double flap"" reconstruction technique was developed to augment the PCF inferiorly by a secondary vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF) that is harvested using an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), when a combined cranionasal (transbasal EEA) approach is performed. This study examines the rates of postoperative CSF leaks and flap necrosis after a combined PCF and NSF closure of the skull base defect. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective review on nine consecutive patients, who underwent the double flap reconstruction technique after a combined transbasal-EEA approach. Data collected for each patient included demographics, method of tumor resection and repair, complications, tumor recurrence, and follow-up. Result(s): Nine patients who underwent a combined transbasal and (EEA) for resection of anterior skull base tumors with significant intracranial extension followed by reconstruction of the cranial base using the double flap were identified. Four were men and five were women, with a mean age of 49 years (range: 15-68 years). There was no postoperative CSF leakage detected or complications of infection, meningitis, mucocele or tension pneumocephalus after a mean follow-up of 15.1 months (range: 4.6-35.4 months). Eight of the nine patients underwent adjuvant radiation without flap necrosis. Tumor recurrence was not observed in any of the patients at last follow-up. Conclusion(s): The simultaneous PCF and NSF double flap reconstruction is an effective technique in preventing postoperative CSF leakage and postradiation necrosis when repairing anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal-EEA approaches.",Excluded

Little is known about the impact of lymphangionesis in neuroblastoma. From a surgical point of view, lymphatic fistula is a potential complication after neuroblastoma surgery. Aim of this study was the evaluation of frequency and impact of lymphatic leakage in a center for neuroblastoma surgery. Design/Methods: Between 2003 and 2014, 210 patients (pts) were resected for neuroblastoma in our department for neuroblastoma. Out of these, 200 patients were eligible for this study. Patient charts were reviewed for INSS stage, surgical radicality, duration of abdominal or thoracic drainage and maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h. Result(s): Out of 200 patients, 73 patients (37%) had a duration of drainage of 7 or more days. Maximum amount of drainage was 4 liters per day; longest duration of intraabdominal drainage was 91 days. In case of chylous fistula, all patients were treated with a conservative approach. Duration of drainage was significantly associated with surgical radicality (p=0.000). Furthermore, the duration of drainage was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h (p=0.000). Lymphatic fistula was significantly associated with INSS stage (p=0.000). Overall Survival (OS) demonstrated a better OS for patients without LL (87% alive) than pts with LL (72% alive). OS was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 hrs (p=0.009), but not with duration of drainage. Conclusion(s): LL is a frequent complication after neuroblastoma surgery and in some cases with substantial loss of fluids and proteins. It can be treated in nearly all cases conservatively. One major problem is the delay of further chemotherapy and radiation which however does not seem to have a great impact on the prognosis.",Excluded

The standards of pharyngolaryngeal tumor treatment have changed over the years in an attempt to prevent laryngeal mutilation (partial surgery, endoscopic surgery, sequential radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). Pain induced by these treatments is frequent and varies from one treatment to another. Chemoradiotherapy induces less pain but often more severe pain, since 20% of these situations are not controlled by strong opioids. Pain from mucositis, although nonspecific to otolaryngic cancer, is more frequent and more severe, and prevention and treatment remain poorly defined. Pain from postradiotherapeutic necrosis (mandibula, laryngeal cartilage, etc.) is less frequent, delayed, and extremely severe. Cervical and shoulder pain is present in more than one-third of patients and stems from a number of mechanisms (myofascial and articulatory). It is secondary to radiotherapy or surgery (XIth cranial nerve lesions during curage or flap reconstruction). Finally, pain coexists with disturbances of basic functions (speech, swallowing, etc.) and the disability generated by treatments. Management of pain, suffering, and the psychosocial impact is essential. [References: 34]",Excluded

1875,"Radiation-resistant subpopulation of JC virus induced medulloblastoma cells does not require the expression of viral tumor antigens for the maintenance of transformed phenotype. JCV is the etiologic agent of the fatal demyelinating disease of the brain, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) that is seen primarily in HIV-AIDS patients. JCVexpresses several tumor antigens from a single transcript via alternative splicing. JCV tumor antigens can inactivate tumor suppressor proteins, inhibit cell cycle regulators, trigger genomic instability, and eventually lead to cellular transformation. In addition to the PML, JC virus has also been shown to cause a variety of tumors in experimental animals. Inoculation of JCV into several experimental animal models, including hamsters, nonhuman primates, and transgenic mice, results in a variety of tumors depending on the animal type, age, and site of inoculation. There is little known regarding the characteristics of JCV induced tumors. Here we analyzed the possible impact of radiation on transformed phenotype by utilizing amousemedulloblastoma cell line (BSB8) obtained from a mouse transgenic for JCV tumor antigens. Our results suggest that radiation induces apoptosis in the majority of the BSB8 cells. Interestingly, a small subset of BSB8 cells survives and shows radiation resistance. We cultured these cells and named as BSB8-RR. Secondary radiation of BSB8-RR cells revealed that they were no longer sensitive to the radiation. Further analysis of the transformed phenotype of BSB8-RR cells with the original BSB8 cells showed that BSB8-RR cells form significantly higher numbers of colonies under anchorage dependent and independent conditions. Moreover, BSB8-RR cells show a reduced rate of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) but increased activity of homologous recombination (HR). More interestingly, knock out studies of JCV tumor antigen by CRISPR/Cas9 approach reveals that unlike BSB8 cells, BSB8-RR cells no longer require the expression of viral tumor antigens. These results suggest that ionizing radiation may eliminate the need of viral tumor antigen expression for the maintenance of transformed phenotype in a small subset of medulloblastoma.",Excluded
4,"Repeated treatments with bevacizumab for recurrent radiation necrosis in patients with malignant brain tumors: a report of 2 cases. Bevacizumab is expected to constitute a new treatment modality for radiation necrosis. In the present cases, we observed a recurrence of radiation necrosis after temporary improvement by bevacizumab treatment. Re-treatment with bevacizumab controlled the necrosis again. A 39-year-old male and a 57-year-old female were diagnosed with glioblastoma and lung cancer metastasis, respectively. The former patient underwent partial resection of the glioblastoma, followed by boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and 30 Gy of fractionated X-ray radiotherapy. Eleven months after BNCT, he suffered from left hemiparesis and convulsions with enlargement of a perifocal edema. The latter patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery twice for the same tumor. Three months after the second radiosurgery, she had an uncontrollable convulsion and right hemiplegia with a massive perifocal edema. Both lesions were suggested to be radiation necroses by positron emission tomography using amino acids as a tracer. Neither patient responded to corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or vitamin E. They underwent treatment with 5 mg/kg bevacizumab biweekly, for a total of 6 cycles. The size of the perifocal edema was clearly reduced in response to the treatments. The neurological status of the patients improved concomitant with therapy. However, the clinical status of both patients was aggravated several months after the bevacizumab was stopped, and the perifocal edemas enlarged again. The patients underwent a second treatment with bevacizumab, and the perifocal edemas again decreased.

The structure of enkephalin, a small neuropeptide with five amino acids, has been simulated on computers using molecular dynamics. Such simulations exhibit a few stable conformations, which also have been identified experimentally. The simulations provide the possibility to perform cluster analysis in the space defined by potentially pharmacophoric measures such as dihedral angles, side-chain orientation, etc. By analyzing the statistics of the resulting clusters, the probability distribution of the side-chain conformations may be determined. These probabilities allow us to predict the selectivity of [Leu]enkephalin and [Met]enkephalin to the known mu- and delta-type opiate receptors to which they bind as agonists. Other plausible consequences of these probability distributions are discussed in relation to the way in which they may influence the dynamics of the synapse.",Excluded

Aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility of radioguided surgical nodal staging using <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC(TEKTROTYD) in GEP-NETs. Subjects and methods: Patients with histologically proven GEP-NET eligible to radical or palliative surgery showing avid tumor uptake on <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy and SPECT/CT were prospectively enrolled. Approximately 4h before surgery, 185 MBq of <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC were i.v. administered. Intraoperative localization of primary tumor and radioactive lymph nodes was performed using a hand-held gamma-probe set on <sup>99M</sup>Tc energy peak. Radioactive lymph nodes were localized and excised before proceeding to regional lymphadenectomy. Extra-regional lymphatic basins were also investigated. Resected specimens were re-evaluated ex vivo with the gamma-probe after macroscopic lymph node isolation. Result(s): Since February 2017, fve GEP-NET patients were enrolled (3 pts had G1-G2 ileal NET, 1 pt G2 rectal NET and 1 pt gastric NEC). All primary lesions seen on pre-operative scin-tigraphy were successfully localized with gamma-probe and completely excised. Mean in-vivo tumor count-rate was 399 counts-per-second/cps (range 80-496). Histological examination confrmed pre-operative diagnosis in all cases. A total of 107 lymph nodes was resected (mean number per patient 21, range 14-40), including 35 radioactive lymph nodes (mean number 7, range 3-12). Mean in-vivo nodal count-rate was 185 cps (range 14-722). 20/35 radioactive lymph nodes were meta-static at histologic examination (mean number 4, range 1-11). No metastatic involvement of ""cold"" lymph nodes was reported. Notably, ex-vivo count-rate of metastatic lymph nodes showed no significant variation from in-vivo gamma-probe evaluation, whereas non-involved nodes showed generally a sharp decrease in ex-vivo count-rate. In one patient, radioguided nodal evaluation determined the localization of a metastatic node in a extra-regional district. Median follow-up after surgery was 11 months (range 5-13). Clinical and instrumental follow-up evaluation showed stable disease in every patient, with no evidence of nodal disease recurrence. Conclusion(s): This pilot study con-frmed feasibility of radioguided nodal staging in GEP-NET patients.

A sham stimulation was used as a control condition.RESULTS: Whilst, as previously reported, stimulation to both the left and the right dlPFC improved action, but not object naming in the mild AD group; an improved naming accuracy for both classes of stimuli was found in the moderate to severe group.CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the dlPFC improves naming performance also in the advanced stages of AD. Moreover, in the severe group the effect is not specific for action naming, as in the case of the mild AD group. These findings suggest that rTMS can affect the intrinsic ability of the brain to restore or compensate for damaged function and may represent an useful new tool for cognitive rehabilitation.",Excluded
819,"FM1-43 is a permeant blocker of mechanosensitive ion channels in sensory neurons and inhibits behavioural responses to mechanical stimuli. The molecular identity and pharmacological properties of mechanically gated ion channels in sensory neurons are poorly understood. We show that FM1-43, a styryl dye used to fluorescently label cell membranes, permeates mechanosensitive ion channels in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, resulting in blockade of three previously defined subtypes of mechanically activated currents. Blockade and dye uptake is voltage dependent and regulated by external Ca2+. The structurally related larger dye FM3-25 inhibited mechanically activated currents to a lesser degree and did not permeate the channels. In vivo, FMI-43 decreases pain sensitivity in the Randall-Selitto test and increases the withdrawal threshold from von Frey hairs, together suggesting that the channels expressed at the cell body in culture mediate mechanosensation in the intact animal. These data give further insight into the mechanosensitive ion channels expressed by somatosensory neurons and suggest FM dyes are an interesting tool for studying them.",Excluded
2619,"Impact of brain metastasis velocity on neurologic death for brain metastasis patients experiencing distant brain failure after initial stereotactic radiosurgery. PURPOSE: Patients with high rates of developing new brain metastases have an increased likelihood of dying of neurologic death. It is unclear, however, whether this risk is affected by treatment choice following failure of primary stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: From July 2000 to March 2017, 440 patients with brain metastasis were treated with SRS and progressed to have a distant brain failure (DBF). Eighty-seven patients were treated within the immunotherapy era. Brain metastasis velocity (BMV) was calculated for each patient. In general, the institutional philosophy for use of salvage SRS vs whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was to postpone the use of WBRT for as long as possible and to treat with salvage SRS when feasible. No further treatment was reserved for patients with poor life expectancy and who were not expected to benefit from salvage treatment.RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients were treated with repeat SRS, 91 patients were treated with salvage WBRT, and 64 patients received no salvage radiation therapy. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death after salvage SRS vs WBRT was 15% vs 23% for the low- (p = 0.06), 30% vs 37% for the intermediate- (p < 0.01), and 31% vs 48% (p < 0.01) for the high-BMV group. Salvage WBRT was associated with increased incidence of neurologic death on multivariate analysis (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.39, p = 0.01) when compared to repeat SRS. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death for patients treated within the immunotherapy era was 9%, 38%, and 38% for low-, intermediate-, and high-BMV groups, respectively (p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Intermediate and high risk BMV groups are predictive of neurologic death.

UNLABELLED: To evaluate the appropriate model for calculating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with PET and H(2)(15)O, the values obtained from 1- and 2-compartment analyses were compared.METHODS: Dynamic PET scans were performed on 12 healthy volunteers after injection of H(2)(15)O in 2 conditions of baseline and visual stimulation. Calculation of rCBF was performed using the 2-weighted integral (WI) and autoradiographic methods for the 1-compartment analysis, and the 3-WI method was followed for the 2-compartment analysis. Arterial blood radioactivity was counted continuously and corrected for delay and dispersion. The rCBF images were transformed into the Talairach space and analyzed by statistical parametric mapping to identify regional differences in the 2 methods. The values obtained from regions of interest also were compared.RESULTS: Although the difference in global CBF between the 2 models was not significant, rCBF values in the large arteries and neighbor areas were significantly greater in the 2-WI method than in the 3-WI method. However, regional differences in the activation studies were not affected when the 2 methods were compared. The images of cerebral arterial blood volume (V(0)) obtained by the 3-WI method showed a significant increase in V(0) in the visual cortex during visual stimulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the rCBF values in the 1-compartment analysis were affected by radioactivity in the vessels.

Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records were reviewed and clinical data collected on AT/RT in a 6 year period (2006-12). Histopathology slides were reviewed and relevant immunohistochemistry stains were done. Overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of factors predictive of overall survival was done by Log Rank test. Result(s): 15 patients met the study criterion (male: female=4:1). Median age at presentation was 5 years (range 0.8-8 years). Presenting complaints included vomiting (73.33%), headache (46.67%), orbital symptoms (33.33%), motor impairment (26.67%), gait abnormality (20%) and seizure (20%). Median duration of symptoms was noted to be 2 months (range 0.5-6 months). On contrast enhanced MRI of brain, tumour location was supratentorial in 60% patients and infratentorial in 40% patients. Cystic component and hydrocephalus were noted in 73.33% patients each whereas contrast enhancement and calcification were discerned in 53.33% and 40% of the patients respectively. All patients underwent tumour resection - gross total (26.67%), neartotal (13.33%) and subtotal (60%). Histopathology was confirmative of AT/RT with MIB-1 labelling index varying from 11-85% (median 45%). There was lack of immunostaining for INI-1 suggesting INI-1 mutation. Majority of tumours exhibited immunopositivity for EMA (93.33%), synaptophysin (80%), cytokeratin (66.67%), vimentin (66.7%), SMA (60%), GFAP (46.67%). Adjuvant radiation (36 Gy/20#/4 weeks to entire neuraxis followed by local boost 20 Gy/10#/2 weeks) was started in 6 patients (40%) and completed in 5 patients. Young age at presentation and poor performance status precluded the use of radiation in the remainder. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 10 (66.67%) patients. Median number of cycles given was 3 (range 1-12) with ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide) being the common regimens (26.67% and 20% respectively). After a median follow-up of 8.33 months (mean-12.27 months), median overall survival was noted to be 10 months. At last follow-up, 2 patients are in complete response, 1 patient is on treatment, 3 patients are alive with evidence of disease and 9 patients expired due to disease progression.

Obese and morbidly obese patients received increased contrast (NO = 180 [150-230]mL, O = 190 [160-250]mL, MO = 200 [165-225]mL, p = 0.016), dose area product (NO = 75.56 [50.61-113.69]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, O = 116.4 [76.11-157.82]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, MO = 125.62 [92.22-158.81]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, p < 0.0001), entrance air kerma (NO = 1439.42 [977.0-2075.5]mGy, O = 2111.63 [1492.0-3011.0]mGy, MO = 2376.0 [1700.0-3234.42]mGy, p < 0.0001), and peak skin dose (NO = 1439.42 [977.0-2075.5], O = 2111.63 [1492.0-3011.0], MO = 2376.0 [1700.0-3234.42], p < 0.0001). Effective radiation dose increased in obese patients (NO = 20.9 +/- 14.9mSv, O = 27.4 +/- 17.1mSv, MO = 24.1 +/- 12.6mSv, p < 0.0001 for NO vs O, p = 0.449 for NO vs MO). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous coronary intervention can be performed in obese and morbidly obese patients without elevated risk for most clinical outcomes. However, radiation increases above levels that could cause both transient and late effects. Strategies should be pursued to minimise radiation dose. Copyright Â© 2017",Excluded
1329,"3D Variation in delineation of head and neck organs at risk. Background: Consistent delineation of patient anatomy becomes increasingly important with the growing use of highly conformal and adaptive radiotherapy techniques. This study investigates the magnitude and 3D localization of interobserver variability of organs at risk (OARs) in the head and neck area with application of delineation guidelines, to establish measures to reduce current redundant variability in delineation practice. Method(s): Interobserver variability among five experienced radiation oncologists was studied in a set of 12 head and neck patient CT scans for the spinal cord, parotid and submandibular glands, thyroid cartilage, and glottic larynx. For all OARs, three endpoints were calculated: the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), the Concordance Index (CI) and a 3D measure of variation (3D SD). Result(s): All endpoints showed largest interobserver variability for the glottic larynx (ICC = 0.27, mean CI = 0.37 and 3D SD = 3.9 mm). Better agreement in delineations was observed for the other OARs (range, ICC = 0.32-0.83, mean CI = 0.64-0.71 and 3D SD = 0.9-2.6 mm). Cranial, caudal, and medial regions of the OARs showed largest variations. All endpoints provided support for improvement of delineation practice. Conclusion(s): Variation in delineation is traced to several regional causes. Measures to reduce this variation can be: (1) guideline development, (2) joint delineation review sessions and (3) application of multimodality imaging. Improvement of delineation practice is needed to standardize patient treatments.",Excluded

She had previously been evaluated at an urgent care facility where she was given a course of steroids for her symptoms. Although she had brief improvement with prednisone, her symptoms returned after the course ended. She denied any other systemic symptoms specifically weight loss, fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She had recently noticed darkening of her urine and possible jaundice, but stated this seemed to be improving. Her physical exam was notable for jaundice without evidence of chronic liver disease. Her abdomen was soft , non-tender, and she had no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation showed AST 166 IU/L, ALT 90 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.4 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase of 401 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse dilation of intrahepatic ducts and a 1.5-cm common bile duct (CBD), as well as 4.8 x 6.7 cm heterogeneous mass in the gallbladder with a second similarly enhancing lesion seen at the distal CBD. The pancreas appeared normal. An ERCP was performed which revealed a polypoid appearing mass within the distal bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and this was biopsied after eversion into the duodenal lumen. Initial differential included biliary cystadenoma/ adenocarcinoma versus atypical cholangiocarcinoma versus lymphoma or IPMN of the bile ducts. However, biopsy specimen showed pigmented deposition on H&E stain with subsequent positive staining for S-100 and HMB proteins consistent with melanoma. Unfortunately, a staging MRI of the brain showed evidence of metastatic lesions. Thorough skin, eye, and mucosal examination did not reveal evidence of a primary lesion, and a CT-PET scan showed large, hypermetabolic lesions in the gallbladder and distal bile duct without evidence of other primary source. Therefore, our final diagnosis is primary biliary melanoma with metastatic disease to the brain. Only 10 other cases of primary biliary melanoma have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is based on stage of disease at presentation with surgical resection providing the best chance for survival. Unfortunately, our patient had metastases present at diagnosis and was not a candidate for surgery. In the 6 months since diagnosis, she has been treated with radiation and Anti-CTLA 4 therapy and is undergoing evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials.",Excluded
1687,"Characterization of symmetric complexes of nerve growth factor and the ectodomain of the pan-neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the ligand for two unrelated cellular receptors, TrkA and p75(NTR), and acts as a mediator in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system. Signaling through TrkA kinase domains promotes neuronal survival, whereas activation of the p75(NTR) ""death domains"" induces apoptosis under correct physiological conditions. However, co-expression of these receptors leads to enhanced neuronal survival upon NGF stimulation, possibly through a ternary p75(NTR) x NGF x TrkA complex. We have expressed human p75(NTR) ligand binding domain as a secreted glycosylated protein in Trichoplusia ni cells. Following assembly and purification of soluble p75(NTR) x NGF complexes, mass spectrometry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and solution x-ray scattering measurements are indicative of 2:2 stoichiometry, which implies a symmetric complex. Molecular models of the 2:2 p75(NTR) x NGF complex based on these data are not consistent with the further assembly of either symmetric (2:2:2) or asymmetric (2:2:1) ternary p75(NTR) x NGF x TrkA complexes.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To determine the detection rate of intracranial vessel occlusions using CT perfusion-based wavelet-transformed angiography (waveletCTA) in acute ischemic stroke patients, in whom single-phase CTA (spCTA) failed to detect an occlusion.METHODS: Subjects were selected from a cohort of 791 consecutive patients who underwent multiparametric CT including whole-brain CT perfusion. Inclusion criteria were (1) significant cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficit, (2) no evidence of vessel occlusion on spCTA and (3) follow-up-confirmed acute ischemic infarction. waveletCTA was independently analysed by two readers regarding presence and location of vessel occlusions. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of waveletCTA-detected occlusions.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, an occlusion was identified using waveletCTA in 31 (52.5 %) patients with negative spCTA. Out of 47 patients with middle cerebral artery infarction, 27 occlusions (57.4 %) were detected by waveletCTA, mainly located in the M2 (15) and M3 segments (8). The presence of waveletCTA-detected occlusions was associated with larger CBF deficit volumes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.335, p = 0.010) and shorter times from symptom onset (OR = 0.306, p = 0.041).CONCLUSIONS: waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in about half of acute ischemic stroke patients and may potentially identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy.KEY POINTS: * waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in stroke patients. * waveletCTA-detected occlusions are associated with larger cerebral blood flow deficits. * waveletCTA has the potential to identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy. * waveletCTA implies neither additional radiation exposure nor extra contrast agent.",Excluded

Brachytherapy is one of most effective methods of radiotherapy for cancer, and therefore, low-dose-rate brachytherapy is widely used for carcinoma of the uterus and carcinoma of the tongue. Between 1974 and 1983, 76 primary thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas were treated with external irradiation combined with additional intracavitary radium therapy at the National Sapporo Hospital. The esophageal primary control rate was 34% and the 5-year survival rate was 24.1%. We believe that external irradiation therapy followed by additional intracavitary radium irradiation produces good results. Also, from 1982, 30 patients with small residual or unresectable tumors received interstitial irradiation using an after-loading technique and iridium-192 seeds. Eighteen of these 30 patients treated with iridium-192 were recurrent cases, and 20 had outer tubes intra-operatively inserted into the tumor following iridium-192 irradiation. Ten of these patients had brain tumor, nine had cancer of the head and neck, and each of the remaining fifteen had the following malignancies: lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, uterus cancer, skin cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. Overall 4-year survival was 17.1% in among the patients treated with Ir 192.

Purpose: Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the effects of light/dark adaptation in a mouse model of inherited photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), and to study dynamics of subretinal fluid during the progress of retinal degeneration.Methods: rd10 and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were reared in cyclic light or darkness and imaged with Bioptigen UHR-OCT or Spectralis HRA+OCT after adaptation to either light or darkness.Results: OCT images from rd10 mice were analyzed at three progressive stages of degeneration. After light-adaptation, stage I (postnatal age [P]26-29) eyes demonstrated no apparent subretinal fluid. At stage II (P32-38), subretinal fluid was present and restricted to parapapillary area, while at stage III (P44-45) extensive subretinal fluid was present across many retinal areas. Following overnight dark-adaptation, WT eyes showed a large reduction in outer retinal thickness (4.6 +/- 1.4 mum, n = 16), whereas this change was significantly smaller in stage I rd10 eyes (1.5 +/- 0.5 mum, n = 14). In stage II rd10 eyes, dark-adaptation significantly reduced the extent of subretinal fluid, with the amount of reduction correlating with the amount of fluid pre-existing in the light-adapted state. However, dark-adaptation did not significantly alter the amount of subretinal fluid observed in stage III rd10 mice. In addition, dark-rearing of rd10 mice from P6 to P30 slowed retinal degeneration.Conclusions: Visual experience in the form of light/dark adaptation exerts a significant effect on outer retinal structure in the context of photoreceptor degeneration. This effect may arise from light-dependent alterations in fluid transport across the RPE monolayer, and promote photoreceptor survival as induced by dark-rearing.",Excluded

The relative SPECT values are often inaccurate by the scattering and limited spatial resolution of single photon emission CT (SPECT). These effects were studied using phantoms and some attentions on clinical application were investigated. Using cylindrical phantom divided into six compartments filled with various radioactivities, the linear correlation between SPECT value and radioactivity, and also correlation with partial reduction of radioactivity were identified. But the SPECT value was relatively increased in proportion to the reduction of radioactivity due to the increase of scattering contribution. The SPECT value represented lower radioactivity when the cortical thickness was smaller than two times of FWHM and represented half radioactivity when the cortical thickness was equal to FWHM. Excellent correlation between SPECT value and radioactive partial volume averaging of brain with CSF was recognized using our hand made phantom simulating various degree of atrophic brain. It is very important to compare SPECT image with X-CT or MR image to avoid misreading taking the above mentioned effects due to scattering and limited spatial resolution.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the association between hippocampal dose and long-term neurocognitive function (NCF) impairment for benign or low-grade adult brain tumors treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients with benign or low-grade adult brain tumors were treated with FSRT per institutional practice. No attempt was made to spare the hippocampus. NCF testing was conducted at baseline and 18 months follow-up, on a prospective clinical trial. Regression-based standardized z scores were calculated by using similar healthy control individuals evaluated at the same test-retest interval. NCF impairment was defined as a z score <=-1.5. After delineation of the bilateral hippocampi according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contouring atlas, dose-volume histograms were generated for the left and right hippocampi and for the composite pair. Biologically equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions (EQD(2)) assuming an alpha/beta ratio of 2 Gy were computed. Fisher's exact test and binary logistic regression were used for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Dose-response data were fit to a nonlinear model.RESULTS: Of 29 patients enrolled in this trial, 18 completed both baseline and 18-month NCF testing. An EQD(2) to 40% of the bilateral hippocampi >7.3 Gy was associated with impairment in Wechsler Memory Scale-III Word List (WMS-WL) delayed recall (odds ratio [OR] 19.3; p = 0.043). The association between WMS-WL delayed recall and EQD(2) to 100% of the bilateral hippocampi >0.0 Gy trended to significance (OR 14.8; p = 0.068).CONCLUSION: EQD(2) to 40% of the bilateral hippocampi greater than 7.3 Gy is associated with long-term impairment in list-learning delayed recall after FSRT for benign or low-grade adult brain tumors. Given that modern intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques can reduce the dose to the bilateral hippocampi below this dosimetric threshold, patients should be enrolled in ongoing prospective trials of hippocampal sparing during cranial irradiation to confirm these preliminary results.",Excluded

Acute flank pain is a frequent clinical presentation encountered in emergency departments, and a work-up for obstructive urolithiasis in this setting is a common indication for computed tomography (CT). However, imaging alternatives to CT for the evaluation of renal colic are warranted in some clinical situations, such as younger patients, pregnancy, patients that have undergone multiple prior CT exams and also patients with vague clinical presentations. MRI, although relatively insensitive for the direct detection of urinary calculi, has the ability to detect the secondary effects of obstructive urolithiasis.

Purpose: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis, especially for patients with gross residual tumor after surgery (RPA classes V and VI). In vitro studies demonstrated the hyper-radiosensitivity of human malignant glioma cell lines to low radiation doses, moreover preclinical studies hypothesized a synergism between low doses fractionated radiotherapy (LD-FRT) and chemotherapy. Therefore we planned a pilot study to define the feasibility and the efficacy of this approach in na GBM RPA classes V-VI. Materials: Patients enrolled in the study had the following characteristics: histological diagnosis of GBM, based on minimal surgical resection or biopsy; age 18-80 years; RPA classes V-VI; estimated survival 3 months; normal haematological, renal, hepatic, cardiac and respiratory functions. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined as the surgical bed with gross residual contrast-enhancing tissue on magnetic resonance imaging. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was defined as the GTV with a 30 mm margin to incluDe any potential subclinical tumor. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as CTV + 5 mm, due to set-up uncertainties. Hypofractionated 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) was delivered on GTV (total dose: 30 Gy in fractions of 3 Gy/day) with concomitant and adjuvant (1 cycle) temozolomiDe (TMZ). From second to fifth cycle of adjuvant TMZ (200 mg/m2), if neither progression disease was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, nor unacceptable toxicities were recorded, LD-FRT was associated (2 daily fractions of 0.40 Gy, over 5 days, q 28). Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of toxicity and safety of this schedula (RTOG criteria). Clinical response (RECIST criteria), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. Result(s): From June 2008 to October 2010 15 patients with a newly diagnosis of GBM were enrolled in this study. Eight patients underwent incomplete surgical resection and 7 patients received only biopsy. The median total dose of LD-FRT delivered was 1040 cGy (range 320 1920). Up to this date 11 patients are evaluable. GraDe 12 haematological toxicity was observed in 18 % of patients, graDe 34 was observed in 9 % of patients, mainly represented by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; however no neurological acute and late toxicity were observed. No treatment related death occurred. Four patients (36%) had a partial response (PR), while 2 patients (18%) had a stable disease (SD), lasting more than 8 weeks (Clinical Benefit 54%). At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 2 22) median PFS was 5 months and median OS was 9 months, with a survival rate at 1 year of 30%.

1863,"Electrophysiological characterization of interlaminar entorhinal connections: an essential link for re-entrance in the hippocampal-entorhinal system. The hippocampal formation communicates with the neocortex mainly through the adjacent entorhinal cortex. Neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation are found in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex and are largely segregated from the neurons receiving hippocampal output, which are located in deep entorhinal layers. We studied the communication between deep and superficial entorhinal layers in the anaesthetized rat using field potential recordings, current source density analysis and single unit measurements. We found that subiculum stimulation was able to excite entorhinal neurons in deep layers. This response was followed by current sinks in superficial layers. Both responses were subject to frequency dependent facilitation, but not depression. Selective blockade of deep layer responses also abolished subsequent superficial layer responses. This clearly demonstrates a functional deep-to-superficial layer communication in the entorhinal cortex, which can be triggered by hippocampal output. This pathway may provide a means by which processed hippocampal output is integrated or compared with new incoming information in superficial entorhinal layers, and it constitutes an important link in the process of re-entrance of activity in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, which may be important for consolidation of memories or retaining information for short periods.",Excluded

The bremsstrahlung component of the decay scheme of 165Dy has been traditionally ignored in internal dosimetry calculations. We have estimated the bremsstrahlung dose of 165Dy distributed in muscle and bone to body by various internal organs (adrenals, brain, breasts, gallbladder wall, LLI wall, small intestine, stomach, ULI wall, heart wall, kidneys, liver, lungs, muscle, ovaries, pancreas, red marrow, bone surfaces, skin, spleen, testes, thymus, thyroid, urine bladder wall, uterus, fetus, placenta, and total body) during radiosynovictomy. In the present study, muscle and bone are considered to be source organs. These estimated values show that the bremsstrahlung radiation absorbed dose contribution from an organ to itself is very small compared to that originating from the beta source. However, contribution to other organs is not always negligible, especially when large amounts of 165Dy may be involved, such as in therapy applications. Hence the component of the total dose due to bremsstrahlung dose should be considered in radiosynovictomy or other therapy applications.",Excluded

2688,"DNA damage response of clinical carbon ion versus photon radiation in human glioblastoma cells. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbon ion radiotherapy is a promising therapeutic option for glioblastoma patients due to its high physical dose conformity and greater biological effectiveness than photons. However, the biological effects of carbon ion radiation are still incompletely understood. Here, we systematically compared the biological effects of clinically used carbon ion radiation to photon radiation with emphasis on DNA repair.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two human glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and LN229) were irradiated with carbon ions or photons and DNA damage response was systematically analyzed, including clonogenic survival, induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), cell cycle arrest and apoptosis or autophagy. gammaH2AX foci were analyzed by flow cytometry, conventional light microscopy and 3D superresolution microscopy.RESULTS: DSBs were repaired delayed and with slower kinetics after carbon ions versus photons. Carbon ions caused stronger and longer-lasting cell cycle delays, predominantly in G2 phase, and a higher rate of apoptosis. Compared to photons, the effectiveness of carbon ions was less cell cycle-dependent. Homologous recombination (HR) appeared to be more important for DSB repair after carbon ions versus photons in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient U87 cells, as opposed to PTEN-proficient LN229 cells.CONCLUSION: Carbon ions induced more severe DSB damage than photons, which was repaired less efficiently in both cell lines. Thus, carbon ion radiotherapy may help to overcome resistance mechanisms of glioblastoma associated with DNA repair for example in combination with repair pathway-specific drugs in the context of personalized radiotherapy.",Excluded

However, little is known about the safety and outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy and stereotactic radiation for the treatment of brain metastases (BMs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed retrospectively from two prospective nivolumab protocols enrolling 160 patients with advanced resected and unresectable melanoma at a single institution. Patients were included if BMs were diagnosed and treated with stereotactic radiation within 6 months of receiving nivolumab. The primary end point of this study was neurotoxicity; secondary end points included BM control and survival.RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with a total of 73 BMs treated over 30 sessions were identified.

Median overall survival (OS) from the date of stereotactic radiation and nivolumab initiation was 11.8 and 12.0 months, respectively, in patients receiving nivolumab for unresected disease (median OS was not reached in patients treated in the resected setting).CONCLUSIONS: In our series, stereotactic radiation to melanoma BMs is well tolerated in patients who received nivolumab. BM control and OS appear prolonged compared with standard current treatment. Prospective evaluation is warranted.",Excluded
678,"Feasibility, Safety, and Periprocedural Complications of Pipeline Embolization for Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Under Conscious Sedation: University at Buffalo Neurosurgery Experience. BACKGROUND: Endovascular Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) placement for intracranial aneurysms is performed under general anesthesia at most centers because of perceived improved image quality and patient safety.OBJECTIVE: To report the feasibility, safety, and outcomes associated with the use of the PED for intracranial aneurysms performed in awake patients after the administration of conscious sedation (CS) and a local anesthetic.METHODS: Between March 2012 and September 2014, 130 patients with 139 intracranial aneurysms (8 ruptured) were treated with the PED under CS at our institution. Procedure details and time (including duration, radiation exposure, and fluoroscopy) and procedure-related complications were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 155 PED deployment procedures were performed under CS. Treatment was successfully completed in all cases. Anesthesia was converted from CS to general anesthesia during 5 procedures. Mean interval from patient entry at the endovascular suite to procedure initiation was 18 minutes (range, 5 minutes-1 hour 10 minutes). Mean procedure length was 1 hour 25 minutes (range, 30 minutes-3 hours 51 minutes). Mean +/- SD values for fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were 36.17 +/- 18.4 minutes and 1367 +/- 897 mGy, respectively. The mean amount of contrast material administered was 211.37 +/- 83.5 mL. Permanent neurological complications were seen in 4 patients (3%).CONCLUSION: In our experience, CS for PED placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment is feasible and safe. Procedure and fluoroscopy times and amount of radiation exposure are similar to or less than described in reports of PED placement under general anesthesia. CS allows direct neurological evaluation and earlier detection of and response to intraprocedural complications.",Excluded
675,"Differential responses to NMDA receptor activation in rat hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells may underlie enhanced pyramidal cell vulnerability. Hippocampal interneurons are generally more resistant than pyramidal cells to excitotoxic insults. Because NMDA receptors play a crucial role in neurodegeneration, we have compared the response to exogenous NMDA in CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons of the stratum oriens using combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording and ratiometric Ca2+ imaging. In voltage-clamp, current-clamp or in nominally Mg2+-free medium, NMDA (10 microM; 3-5 min exposure in the presence of tetrodotoxin) induced a markedly larger inward current and Ca2+ rise in pyramidal cells than in interneurons. Pyramidal cells also showed a more pronounced voltage dependence in their response to NMDA. We hypothesized that this enhanced response to NMDA receptor activation in pyramidal cells could underlie their increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity. Using loss of dye as an indicator of degenerative membrane disruption, interneurons tolerated continuous exposure to a high concentration of NMDA (30 microM) for longer periods than pyramidal cells. This acute neurodegeneration in pyramidal cells was independent of intracellular Ca2+, because high intracellular BAPTA (20 mM) did not prolong survival time. Thus, a plausible explanation for the enhanced sensitivity of pyramidal neurons to excitotoxic insults associated with cerebral ischemia is their greater response to NMDA receptor activation, which may reflect differences in NMDA receptor expression and/or subunit composition.",Excluded

483,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. [German]. Hyperbaric oxygenation is defined as the administration of 100% oxygen in a compression chamber at an ambient pressure greater than one atmosphere absolute. The increased pressure (up to three atmospheres) induces a 10- to 15-fold plasma oxygen concentration resulting in increased tissue oxygenation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the bactericidal capacity of leukocytes, stimulates important mechanisms in wound healing, reduces tissue oedema and maintains tissue oxygenation even in the absence of haemoglobin. Commonly accepted indications supported by scientific evidence include the decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, severe carbon monoxide poisoning, delayed radiation injury, clostridial myonecrosis and also the improvement of healing of vulnerable skin or soft tissue grafts. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also used in healing difficulties of specific problem wounds, extreme blood loss, intracranial abscesses, necrotizing soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, crush syndrome, burns and sudden deafness. Since hyperbaric oxygenation involves the administration of oxygen in a pharmacological dose, side effects are possible due to barotrauma and oxygen toxicity. During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, an increased amount of oxygen-free radicals may be generated, depending on the duration and extent of pressure elevation during treatment. Although many different organ systems may be affected, the brain is of greatest clinical significance. Neurotoxicity is manifested by visual disturbances, auditory hallucinations, nausea, facial twitching, irritability, dizziness and convulsion.",Excluded

1986,"Gamma knife is effective for type II neurofibromatosisassociated meningioma: A 16-year mayo experience. Introduction/Objective: Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) is a debilitating genetic condition characterized by multiple meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas, and other intracranial and intraspinal tumors such as ependymomas. We reported our experience treating a series of NF2-associated meningiomas with Gamma Knife (GK). Method(s): Between January 1992 and December 2008, 16 consecutive patients (7 male, 9 female, age 20 to 81) with 58 intracranial meningiomas were treated with single-fraction GK. Thirty-three tumors (57%) involved the convexity or parasagittal/falx, 25 (43%) skullbased. None of these meningiomas received prior surgery. Nine patients (56%) had more than 1 meningoma (range, 2 to 4) at presentation. Six patients (38%) also had intraspinal meningiomas which were never treated by radiation. All patients had bilateral (81%) or unilateral (19%) vestibular schwannomas. During follow-up, 6 patients (38%) developed 26 (46%) new intracranial meningomas, termed distant progression, requiring secondary treatments. The median prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 13 to 20), with a maximum dose of 32 Gy (range, 24 to 40). The median heterogeneity index was 2 (range, 1.3 to 2.5). The median tumor diameter and prescription isodose volume were 2.3 cm and 3.6 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) between GK shots per tumor (median 4, range 1 to 22) versus tumor volume was 0.59. The median radiographic and clinical followup periods were 62 and 86 months, respectively. Result(s): Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 0.4 to 14.6), ten patients (63%) required only one treatment, and 6 (37%) required 1 to 6 additional treatments for distant progression. Fifteen (93.8%) patients were alive at last follow-up, with fifty-five tumors (94.8%) controlled (smaller or unchanged in size). Three in-field tumors (5.2%) became larger at 36, 56 and 82 months, respectively, but were not re-treated; they belonged to the same patient who had 14 meningomas treated over 7 times (in 12.7 y). There were no marginal failures. The median time to first radiographic distant progression was 13.7 months (range, 6.2 to 77.5). One minor complication was noted at 12 months, with hemi-body sensory changes which resolved. Two major radiation-related complications occurred at 1 and 3 months, including a 34-year-old woman who died following GK for a parasagittal meningioma. GK-related complication rates remained low overall, and were not associated with tumor volume, location, prescription dose, or chosen isodose level. Conclusion(s): GK is an effective treatment for NF2 patients with meningoma, with 5-year local control rate greater than 90% in our series. Side effects are rare but can be life-threatening including radionecrosis, which may occur within three months after treatment. For NF2 patients who developed distant progression and required repeat treatments elsewhere intracranially, secondary GK appeared safe and equally successful when compared with primary treatment. No high-grade meningoma or secondary non-meningioma malignancy were found as a result of GK radiation exposure.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Simple resection of diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint is associated with local recurrence rates as high as 50%. Thus, adjuvant treatment modalities, such as radiation or intra-articular isotope injection, are sometimes used after tumor resection. Our initial and highly satisfactory experience with the injection of radioactive yttrium 90 to treat pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint eroded with time so much so that we discontinued its use in the ankle and believe that it is important to alert our colleagues to the complications that we observed.METHODS: Between 1989 and 2006, we treated seven patients who had diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint with subtotal synovectomy followed by intra-articular injection of 15 mCi of yttrium 90.RESULTS: Two of the study patients had full-thickness skin necrosis develop around the injection site, necessitating free muscle flap transfer within three months of treatment, and a third patient had development of a draining sinus that was associated with chronic severe pain. The other four patients reported pain after the injection that was reasonably controlled by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. At the most recent follow-up evaluation, no study patient had recurrent disease.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the unacceptably high rate of serious complications associated with the injection of yttrium 90 into the ankle joint following subtotal synovectomy, we discontinued its use as a local adjuvant in the management of diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle.",Excluded
2018,"Role and relevance of neurocognitive assessment in clinical trials of patients with CNS tumors. The inclusion of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials of patients with CNS tumors is increasing. Neurocognitive end points are used to understand what cognitive problems exist before treatment to establish a baseline by which the effect of treatment is judged, and to determine whether different treatment regimens improve neurocognitive function due to better tumor control, slow expected neurocognitive deterioration due to the tumor, or have more or less short- and long-term neurotoxicity. However, the use of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials for patients with CNS tumors is in its infancy, so that long-term outcomes are difficult to predict and the ability to determine the effects of different agents and treatment approaches is scant. Including this aspect of patient evaluation in addition to survival and time to tumor progression will yield better risk-versus-benefit assessments as well as provide a basis for improving interventions.

2426,"Diminished capacity for p53 in mediating a radiation-induced G1 arrest in established human tumor cell lines. It has been reported that the p53 gene mediates an ionizing radiation-induced G1 arrest in mammalian cells. To further characterize this important phenomenon, a panel of seven human diploid fibroblast cell strains and 14 human tumor cell lines from a variety of sources with both wild-type and mutant p53 status were assayed for their susceptibility to G1 arrest after gamma-ray irradiation by a continuous labeling [3H]thymidine incorporation technique. An irreversible G1-block involving 20-70% of the cell population was observed in diploid fibroblasts irradiated with 4 Gy. The block was abolished by transfection with the Human Papilloma Virus E6 gene and in an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, indicating a role for the AT and p53 genes respectively in this process. In contrast to wild-type normal fibroblast cell strains, the G1-block in all tumor cell lines was significantly reduced, irrespective of their p53 status. None of the nine human tumor cell lines with mutant p53 genes showed a significant G1-block following irradiation with 4 Gy. Among the five tumor cell lines expressing wild-type p53, two showed no apparent G1-block. The remaining three showed a G1-block involving only 8-15% of the cell population, a block much smaller in magnitude than that seen in diploid fibroblasts. Finally, a diploid fibroblast cell strain and a tumor cell line, both showing a normal p53 and p21/WAF1 expression pattern, were examined for pRb phosphorylation before and after irradiation. The diploid fibroblast cell strain showed a significant G1-arrest and a clear inhibition of pRb phosphorylation by irradiation whereas the tumor cells showed no G1-arrest and no inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. These results suggest that (1) multiple genetic factors may modulate the occurrence and magnitude of the G1-arrest induced by exposure to ionizing radiation, (2) the capacity for p53 to mediate a radiation-induced G1 arrest is significantly reduced in tumor cells, (3) the disruption of G1-block modulating factor(s) other than p53 may be an important step in carcinogenesis.",Excluded

3049,"Population-Based Study of Stereotactic Radiosurgery or Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy for Vestibular Schwannoma: Long-Term Outcomes and Toxicities. Purpose: To examine long-term local control of vestibular schwannoma and side effects in patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) in British Columbia. Methods and Materials: From August 1998 to May 2009, 207 patients were treated with radiation therapy (RT) at British Columbia Cancer Agency. 136 (66%) received SRS, and 71 (34%) received SRT. Dose prescriptions were 50 Gy/25 fractions for SRT and 12 Gy/1 fraction for SRS. Our multidisciplinary provincial neuro-stereotactic conference recommended SRT for tumors >3 cm and for patients with serviceable hearing (Gardner-Robertson classes I and II). Result(s): Median follow-up was 7.7 years to the last MRI and 6.4 years to the last clinical assessment. Local control for SRS versus SRT was 94% versus 87% at 5 years and 90% versus 85% at 10 years (P=.2). Five- and 10-year actuarial rates of RT-induced trigeminal nerve dysfunction were 25% and 25% after SRS, compared with 7% and 12% after SRT (P=.01). Five- and 10-year actuarial rates of RT-induced facial nerve dysfunction were 15% and 15% after SRS, versus 13% and 15% after SRT (P=.93). In the 49 patients with serviceable hearing at baseline who were treated with SRT, hearing preservation was 55% at 3 years, 37% at 5 years, and 29% at 7 years. In multivariable analysis, better pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average was significantly associated with hearing preservation (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.07; P=.04). Conclusion(s): Both SRS and SRT provided excellent long-term local control of vestibular schwannoma. Stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with higher rates of trigeminal nerve dysfunction. Even with a fractionated course, hearing preservation declined steadily with long-term audiometric follow-up. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1107,"Radio-opaque, MRI-compatible, shape-memory polymer embolic coils: In vitro and in vivo evaluation. Purpose: Embolic coils have primarily been fabricated using metals such as platinum and Nitinol. Although such coils are well accepted clinically, metals are limited by their poor shape memory capacity, poor resistance to kinking, and the inability to fine tune stiffness, elute drugs or biodegrade. Further, metal coils produce artifacts on magnetic resonance images, which necessitates fluoroscopy or CT for follow-up evaluation, increasing radiation exposure to the patient. We report here on recent in vitro and in vivo experience using novel biocompatible shape memory polymers (SMPs) for embolic coil design. Material(s) and Method(s): Neurovascular and peripheral vascular embolic coils were fabricated using a novel, photopolymerized shape memory polymer (EndoShape Inc., Boulder, CO) specifically formulated to provide radiographic and MRI visibility while minimizing MRI artifacts. Control SMP coils were prepared using a standard formulation of tert-Butyl acrylate and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate. Coils were evaluated for radiographic and MRI visibility using in vitro and in vivo (ovine) models, with commercial coils (Nitinol, Cook microNester platinum) as references. Result(s): SMPs formulated for radiographic and MRI visibility did not show significant differences in shape memory behavior from controls. Fluoroscopic imaging yielded normalized x-ray attenuation coefficients of 1.00 (platinum), 0.702 (nitinol), 0.322 (radio-opaque SMP), and 0.009 (control SMP). T1-weighted, 3 mm MRI images revealed markedly distorted signal from both platinum and Nitinol coils. The radio-opaque SMP coils produced no MRI artifact, and individual coil wires were clearly visible on the MRI images. In vivo images of SMP coils delivered into the jugular vein, abdominal aorta, and hepatic vessels showed coil strands clearly under conventional fluoroscopy. Conclusion(s): These specially formulated SMP coils can be engineered with transition temperatures at or below body temperature and with sufficient radio-opacity for accurate fluoroscopic guidance of transcatheter embolization procedures. Moreover, these SMPs possess an inherent MRI signal, with no imaging artifacts, and are easily adaptable for drug-loading and biodegradation.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE To report the methods and results of palladium-103 brachytherapy for American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th edition, T3- and T4-sized choroidal melanomas. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective analysis of the results of a clinical case series over a 10-year period of 47 consecutive patients with uveal melanoma. The patients were treated at The New York Eye Cancer Center, Beth Israel Comprehensive Cancer Center, or The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary between 2002 and 2012 and had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Tumors had a mean preoperative apical tumor height of 8.6mmand a mean largest basal diameter of 15.8 mm. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We analyzed, but were not limited to, data on the methods of radiation therapy, local tumor control, adverse effects, vision retention, and metastatic rate. RESULTS All patients completed therapy and received the prescribed tumor apex dose. At a median of 47 months (range, 6-125 months), the rate of local control was 91% and the rate of eye retention was 89%. The most common long-term brachytherapy-related complication was radiation maculopathy (66%of patients), followed by radiation optic neuropathy (51%of patients). One or both of these complications were diagnosed at a mean time of 16 months (range, 2-36 months) after brachytherapy. Secondary cataract developed in 36%of patients. Glaucoma developed in 17%of patients and resulted in enucleation in 4%of patients. The mean pretreatment visual acuity was 20/50 (range, 20/12.5 to hand motions), which evolved to a mean visual acuity of 20/100 (range, 20/20 to no light perception). Overall, 25 of 47 patients (53%) maintained 20/200 or better vision. Metastatic melanoma developed in 32% of patients.

3544,"Differential target dependence in the developing brain: implications for mental retardation. During development of the brain, many neurons exhibit a dependence on other neuronal populations for their survival and differentiation (target dependence). Evidence suggests that some neural pathways are much more dependent on single target neuronal populations for their survival than are others (differential target dependence). This phenomenon has important implications both for animal models of congenital human brain damage and for ideas concerning the aetiology of behavioural abnormalities associated with human mental retardation. Predictions of the neuronal deficits likely to arise from exposure to cytotoxic agents (e.g. ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, viral infection) at a particular time must take differential target dependence into account. It is known that target dependence affects corticopetal pathways involved with the discriminative senses (e.g. vision), more than monoaminergic and cholinergic corticopetal pathways which are believed to be involved with arousal, selective sensory attention, sleep, memory and cortical vasomotor function. Following prenatal damage to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, this effect of differential target dependence leads not only to a relative hyperinnervation of the cortex with monoaminergic and cholinergic projections, but a specific deficit in visual pathways. The implications of this combined deficit for the behaviour and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded are considered.",Excluded

Measurement were performed under extreme case scenarios wherein maximum secondary neutrons and photons were produced around CV, BTS and GTR3 by stopping 230MeV proton of 300nA on beam degrader, end of BTS and isocenter of GTR3. Weekly time average dose rate (TADR) were calculated from H*(10) value measured at selective hot spots by irradiating actual treatment plans of mix clinical sites.RESULTS: The maximum total H*(10) were within 2 microSv/hr around CV, 5 microSv/hr around outer wall of BTS which increases up to 62 microSv/hr at the end of inside BTS corridor. Maximum H*(10) of 20.8 microSv/hr in treatment control console (P125), 23.4 microSv/hr behind the common wall between GTR3 and GTR2 (P132) and 25.7 microSv/hr above isocenter (P99) were observed around GTR3. Reduction of beam current from 6 to 3 nA and 1 nA at nozzle exit lead to decrease in total H*(10) at P125 from 20.8 to 11.35 and 4.62 microSv/hr. In comparison to extreme case scenario, H*(10) value at P125, P132 and P99 from clinically relevant irradiation parameters were reduce by a factor ranging from 8.6 for high range cube to 46.4 for brain clinical plan. The maximum weekly TADR per fraction was highest for large volume, sacral chordoma patient at 8.5 microSv/hr compare to 0.3 microSv/hr for brain patient. The calculated weekly TADR for 30 mix clinical cases and 15 fractions of 1 L cube resulted total weekly TADR of 83-84 microSv/hr at P125, P132 and P99.

Objective The incidence of brain metastases from melanoma is increasing. Several effective treatment options are now available but what can be considered the optimal therapeutic strategy is not yet defined. We evaluated the outcome of patients with brain metastatic melanoma in terms of local control rate, brain distant progression, and overall survival. Methods The present retrospective study includes only patients with limited brain metastases (<=4) who underwent surgery plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or SRS alone. Surgical resection was performed in patients with good Karnofsky performance score, single large brain lesions, controlled extracranial disease, and SRS alone in all other cases. Supramargical resection was performed in all patients. The prescribed radiotherapy doses were 24 Gy/1 fraction and 30 Gy in 3-5 fractions for lesions >2.5 cm. Clinical outcome was evaluated by brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 2 months after radiotherapy and then every 3 months. Results From April 2011 to October 2015, 53 patients were treated. The median age was 54 years (range, 29-82 years). Most of patients had 1-2 brain metastases (86.8%). Twelve patients (22.6%) underwent surgical resection followed by SRS on the tumor bed, and 41 (77.4%) received SRS alone. The median follow-up time was 20.9 months (range, 5.7-61.3 months). The median, 1-, 2-, 3-year overall survival were 11.8 months, 47.2%, 28%, and 21.8%, respectively. Factors recorded as influencing survival were the number of brain metastases, the melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment score, and BRAF mutated status.

Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values.RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2).

We present a new variant, calcium translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh), which mediates an accelerated response time and a voltage response that is ~70-fold more light sensitive than that of wild-type ChR2. CatCh's superior properties stem from its enhanced Ca2(+) permeability. An increase in [Ca2(+)](i) elevates the internal surface potential, facilitating activation of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and indirectly increasing light sensitivity. Repolarization following light-stimulation is markedly accelerated by Ca2(+)-dependent BK channel activation. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown principle: shifting permeability from monovalent to divalent cations to increase sensitivity without compromising fast kinetics of neuronal activation. This paves the way for clinical use of light-gated channels.",Excluded
2535,"Quantitative assessment of cerebral hemodynamics using perfusion-weighted MRI in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease: comparison with positron emission tomography. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to acetazolamide is a key parameter in determining the severity of hemodynamic impairment in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease. Perfusion-weighted MRI (PW MRI) can measure the cerebral blood volume (CBV) as an indicator of hemodynamic impairment. CBV measured by PW MRI was compared with CVR measured by positron emission tomography (PET).METHODS: Twelve normal subjects and 17 patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease underwent PW MRI and PET. The images were coregistered with 3-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition images. Quantitative PW MRI-CBV maps were generated using the indicator dilution method with arterial input function. One large cortical region of interest for each unilateral middle cerebral artery territory was determined on each image. PET-CVR was calculated by measuring cerebral blood flow before and after acetazolamide challenge.RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was observed between PW MRI-CBV and PET-CVR (r=-0.713; P<0.0001). PW MRI-CBV higher than the mean +2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.2 mL/100 g) was defined as elevated and PET-CVR lower than the mean -2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.1%) was defined as reduced. Assuming the PET-CVR as the true determinant of hemodynamic impairment, PW MRI-CBV provided 80.0% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with 80.0% positive predictive value for detecting patients with reduced CVR.CONCLUSIONS: The PW MRI-CBV method can simply and accurately identify patients with hemodynamic impairment without exposure to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
2272,"Survivin a radiogenetic promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy independently from CArG motifs. BACKGROUND: Radiogenetic therapy is a novel approach in the treatment of cancer, which employs genetic modification to alter the sensitivity of tumor cells to the effect of applied radiation.AIM: To select a potent radiation inducible promoter in the context of brain tumors and to investigate if CArG radio responsive motifs or other elements in the promoter nucleotide sequences can correlate to its response to radiation.METHODS: To select initial candidates for promoter inducible elements, the levels of mRNA expression of six different promoters were assessed using Quantitative RTPCR in D54 MG cells before and after radiation exposure. Recombinant Ad/reporter genes driven by five different promoters; CMV, VEGF, FLT-1, DR5 and survivin were constructed. Glioma cell lines were infected with different multiplicity of infection of the (promoter) Ad or CMV Ad. Cells were then exposed to a range of radiation (0-12 Gy) at single fraction. Fluorescent microscopy, Luc assay and X-gal staining was used to detect the level of expression of related genes. Different glioma cell lines and normal astrocytes were infected with Ad survivin and exposed to radiation. The promoters were analyzed for presence of CArG radio-responsive motifs and CCAAT box consensus using NCBI blast bioinformatics software.RESULTS: Radiotherapy increases the expression of gene expression by 1.25-2.5 fold in different promoters other than survivin after 2 h of radiation. RNA analysis was done and has shown an increase in copy number of tenfold for survivin. Most importantly cells treated with RT and Ad Luc driven by survivin promoter showed a fivefold increase in expression after 2 Gy of radiation in comparison to non-irradiated cells. Presence or absence of CArG motifs did not correlate with promoter response to radiation. Survivin with the best response to radiation had the lowest number of CCAAT box.CONCLUSION: Survivin is a selective potent radiation inducible promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy and this response to radiation could be independent of CArG motifs.",Excluded

646,"Destabilization of peptide binding and interdomain communication by an E543K mutation in the bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein, a molecular chaperone. We have compared 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70) isolated from bovine brain with recombinant wild type protein and mutant E543K protein (previously studied as wild type in our laboratory). Wild type bovine and recombinant protein differ by posttranslational modification of lysine 561 but interact similarly with a short peptide (fluorescein-labeled FYQLALT) and with denatured staphylococcal nuclease-(Delta135-149). Mutation E543K results in 4. 5-fold faster release of peptide and lower stability of complexes with staphylococcal nuclease-(Delta135-149). ATP hydrolysis rates of the wild type proteins are enhanced 6-10-fold by the addition of peptide. The E543K mutant has a peptide-stimulated hydrolytic rate similar to that of wild type protein but a higher unstimulated rate, yielding a mere 2-fold enhancement. All three versions of Hsc70 possess similar ATP-dependent conformational shifts, and all show potassium ion dependence. These data support the following model: (i) in the presence of K+, Mg2+, and ATP, the peptide binding domain inhibits the ATPase; (ii) binding of peptide relieves this inhibition; and (iii) the E543K mutation significantly attenuates the inhibition by the peptide binding domain and destabilizes Hsc70-peptide complexes.",Excluded

1798,"How the use of CBCT and MRI has changed our management of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma remains a clinical diagnosis but today imaging has become an important cornerstone in the diagnostic work-up of this condition. Conebeam CT offers a much higher resolution of the interface between bone, air and soft tissue, while the associated irradiation dose is substantially lower, as compared to multi-detector CT scans. As such, CBCT has become very useful for the pre-op work-up of patients with cholesteatoma showing with precision bony erosion of the ossicular chain and erosion of the petrous bone (as fistulae, perilabyrinthine erosion, intracranial invasion). Also the aeration of theME-cleft is shown (important for the functional prognosis) and important preoperative landmarks warn the surgeon for eventual pitfalls. The advent of the non-EP diffusion weighted sequence in MR-imaging makes this sequence a very useful adjunctive tool in the pre-op work-up of cholesteatoma cases specially in cases suspected of intralabyrinthine spread, or extension medial to the otic capsule or intracranial invasion. Its today almost undisputed value has been demonstrated in the postoperative follow-up of cholesteatoma by the high sensitivity and specificity (in most studies well above 90%). By this innovation many ""unnecessary"" (because absence of residual pathology) second stage operations can today be avoided. Advantages and limitations of the two imaging techniques will be discussed. An algorithm usefull in clinical practice will be proposed.",Excluded
2497,"I-125 brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma photographic and angiographic abnormalities: the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study: COMS Report No. 30. OBJECTIVES: (1) To summarize the protocol used for grading features of postradiation abnormalities from fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms of patients enrolled in the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS); (2) to document the prevalence of features of interest in the posterior pole of these eyes during 8 years of follow-up; and (3) to investigate baseline patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics associated with posterior pole features.DESIGN: Observational case series within a randomized, multicenter clinical trial.PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated 650 patients who were assigned to and received iodine-125 brachytherapy in the COMS for medium-sized tumors.METHODS: Color fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms were taken at baseline and 2, 5, and 8 years; 30 features were graded according to a standard protocol.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence at selected time intervals of fundus photographic features associated with retinopathy and optic neuropathy.RESULTS: The percentage of patients with >/=1 feature of interest was 49.2% at baseline, 84.4% at 2 years, 91.2% at 5 years, and 90.7% at 8 years. The most frequent findings across all follow-up examinations were macular microaneurysms (75.6% of examinations), macular angiographic leakage (75.1%), and optic disc hyperfluorescence (62.8%). The median number of features present increased significantly with each follow-up to a maximum of 7 features at 8 years. The prevalence of neovascularization of the disc at 5 years was 5.2%. The prevalence of optic neuropathy at 5 years was 27.4%. Prognostic factors for more prevalent and severe posterior pole abnormalities were diabetes, tumor location close to both optic nerve and foveal avascular zone, and greater dose of radiation to the foveola and optic nerve head.CONCLUSIONS: The amount and severity of retinopathy and optic neuropathy after iodine-125 brachytherapy increased through 8 years of follow-up. Assessment of photographs and angiograms taken in accord with a standard protocol provided reliable estimates of rates of development of features of retinopathy and optic neuropathy in eyes treated using the COMS brachytherapy protocol.

3165,"Gut flora-targeted photobiomodulation therapy improves senile dementia in an As-induced Alzheimer's disease animal model. BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is believed to have a positive regulatory effect on the imbalance of certain body functions, including inflammation, immunity, wound healing, nerve repair, and pain. Previous studies have found that the intestinal flora of patients with AD is in an unbalanced state. Therefore, we have proposed the use of gut flora-targeted PBM (gf-targeted PBM) as a method to improve AD in an As-induced AD mouse model.METHODS: PBM was performed on the abdomen of the mice at the wavelengths of 630 nm, 730 nm, and 850 nm at 100 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test, immunofluorescence and proteomic of hippocampus, and intestinal flora detection of fecal were used to evaluate the treatment effects of gf-targeted PBM on AD rats.RESULTS: PBM at all three wavelengths (especially 630 nm and 730 nm) significantly improved learning retention as measured by the Morris water maze. In addition, we found reduced amyloidosis and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus by immunofluorescence in AD mice. By using a quantitative proteomic analysis of the hippocampus, we found that gf-targeted PBM significantly altered the expression levels of 509 proteins (the same differentially expressed proteins in all three wavelengths of PBM), which involved the pathways of hormone synthesis, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The 16 s rRNA gene sequencing of fecal contents showed that PBM significantly altered the diversity and abundance of intestinal flora. Specifically, PBM treatment reversed the typical increase of Helicobacter and uncultured Bacteroidales and the decrease of Rikenella seen in AD mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that gf-targeted PBM regulates the diversity of intestinal flora, which may improve damage caused by AD. Gf-targeted PBM has the potential to be a noninvasive microflora regulation method for AD patients.",Excluded
2252,"Laser photocoagulation for radiation retinopathy after ophthalmic plaque radiation therapy. AIM: To evaluate the use of scatter laser photocoagulation to prevent radiation related retinopathy, maculopathy, and loss of vision.METHODS: This was an interventional case series. 66 eyes with posterior choroidal melanomas treated by ophthalmic plaque radiation therapy were reported. Of these patients, 50 were selected because they developed radiation retinopathy; 45 of these were treated with sector scatter laser photocoagulation to regress clinically evident radiation retinopathy. 16 additional patients (considered to be ""high risk"" to develop radiation retinopathy) were also treated.RESULTS: Radiation retinopathy was noted to appear at a mean interval of 26 months following plaque treatment. Laser photocoagulation regressed radiation retinopathy in 29 (64.4%) of the 45 patients treated after the onset of radiation retinopathy (17 with only retinopathy, 10 with a combination of retinopathy and maculopathy, and two with only maculopathy). Of the 16 patients who received laser treatment before clinical evidence of retinopathy, one developed radiation maculopathy and two retinopathy without maculopathy (all three responded to additional laser photocoagulation). In the 45 patient group, vision loss of more than three lines was attributable to radiation maculopathy in seven (15.5%). None of the patients in the prophylactic laser group lost more than three lines of vision as a result of maculopathy.CONCLUSION: Sector scatter argon laser photocoagulation induced regression of radiation retinopathy.

2957,"Evaluating the influence of setup uncertainties on treatment planning for focal liver tumors. PURPOSE: A mechanism has been developed to evaluate the influence of random setup variations on dose during treatment planning. The information available for studying these factors shifts from population-based models toward patient-specific data as treatment progresses and setup measurements for an individual patient become available. This study evaluates the influence of population as well as patient-specific setup distributions on treatment plans for focal liver tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients with focal liver tumors were treated on a protocol that involved online setup measurement and adjustment, as well as ventilatory immobilization. Summary statistics from these three-dimensional conformal treatments yielded individual and population distributions of position at initial setup for each fraction. A convolution model for evaluation of the influence of random setup variation on calculated dose distributions has been previously described and investigated for application to focal liver radiotherapy by our department. Individual patient doses based on initial setup positions were calculated by convolving the calculated dose distribution with an anisotropic probability distribution function representing the individual patient's random variations. A separate convolution using population-averaged random variations was performed. Individual beam apertures were then adjusted to provide plans that ensured proper dose to the clinical target volume following convolution with population distributions, as well as individual patient position uncertainty models.RESULTS: Individual patient setup distributions for the course of treatment had random setup variations (sigma) that ranged from 2.5 to 5.7 mm (left-right), 2.1 to 8.3 mm (anterior-posterior), and 4.1 to 10.8 mm (cranial-caudal). The population random components were 4.2 mm (left-right), 4.1 mm (anterior-posterior), and 7.0 mm (cranial-caudal) at initial setup. The initial static planned dose distribution overestimated the volume of liver irradiated to high doses, because inclusion of setup uncertainties generally blurred the resulting doses, shifting the higher-dose region of normal liver dose-volume histograms to lower doses. Furthermore, the population-based dose convolution tended to predict a higher risk of radiation damage to the liver (based on an in-house parameterization of the Lyman normal tissue complication probability model) than the individual patient calculations. For an individual plan, application of different individual random variations yielded change in effective volume differences with a 3% range. Plan adjustment to account for random setup variations generally resulted in a lower change in effective volume than initial planning using a planning target volume followed by calculation of delivered dose based on random offsets.CONCLUSION: This study hints at the factors that most strongly influence planning of liver treatments taking into account geometric variations. Given a setup verification methodology that rapidly reduces systematic offsets, the importance of realistic incorporation of geometric variations as an initial step in treatment planning, as well as possible plan refinement, is demonstrated.",Excluded
1866,"Sustained ocular venous fluid shift during spaceflight may contribute to optic disc edema. Purpose : The Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) is characterized by the development of optic disc edema, chorioretinal folds, globe flattening, and/or hyperopic shifts in astronauts during 6-month missions on the International Space Station (ISS). We hypothesize that a weightlessness-induced chronic headward fluid shift within the venous system contributes to these ocular changes. Methods : Astronauts (n=10) were studied before flight (seated and supine posture) and ~150 days into a 6-month mission on the ISS. Ocular and vascular measures included optical coherence tomography (OCT; Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering) assessments of sub-macular choroid thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness (TRT; segmented from Bruch's membrane to the internal limiting membrane); ultrasound-derived internal jugular vein (IJV) cross-sectional area (GE VividQ) and non-invasive IJV pressure (Veinpress); and intraocular pressure (IOP; iCare pro pre-flight and TonoPen in-flight). Repeatedmeasures ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was used to determine the mean change between conditions; data are presented as group mean +/- standard deviation. Results : The mean IJV area increased from 9 +/- 6 mm<sup>2</sup> in the seated position to 83 +/- 27 mm<sup>2</sup> in the supine position on Earth and to 64 +/- 31 mm<sup>2</sup> during spaceflight (P<.001). Similarly, mean IJV pressure increased from 4.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg in the seated position to 16.6 +/- 5.6 mmHg in the supine position on Earth and to 14.4 +/- 5.3 mmHg in-flight (P<.001). No significant changes in sub-macular choroid thickness or TRT were detected during the acute preflight posture change, however after 150 days of weightlessness, choroid thickness increased by 50 +/- 37 mum (P<.05) and TRT increased by 26 +/- 32 mum (P=.05) relative to preflight seated values. IOP remained within a normal range in weightlessness, averaging 15.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg after 150 days of spaceflight, compared to 14.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg and 15 +/- 1.1 mmHg pre-flight in the seated and supine positions, respectively. Conclusions : Although a transient posture-induced venous fluid shift has no effect on choroidal or retinal thickness, a sustained, unrelenting cephalad fluid shift during spaceflight results in increased choroidal and retinal thickness. These data suggest that altered venous hemodynamics during spaceflight may contribute to SANS.",Excluded

Background: It has been well established that Laser Therapy irradiation can give analgesia by affecting the conduction of the C fibers, the nerve fibers that carry pain impulses from the dental pulp to the brain. Currently, laser irradiation with an infrared (830 nm) wavelength for analgesia is being used very successfully in a number of dental procedures.

2956,"Does the pretherapeutic tumor SUV in 68Ga DOTATOC PET predict the absorbed dose of 177Lu octreotate?. PURPOSE: Selection of candidates for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is increasingly based on receptor positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, including the common tracer Ga DOTATOC. However, no studies have yet compared standardized uptake values (SUVs) and absorbed doses in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 21 patients with 61 evaluable tumor lesions undergoing both pretherapeutic Ga DOTATOC-PET/CT (Biograph Duo [Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany]; PET acquisition, 75.3 +/- 15.4 minutes postinjection; 117.3 +/- 33.9 MBq Ga DOTATOC) and PRRT with Lu octreotate (7.47 +/- 1.39 GBq; intratherapeutic tumor dosimetry with serial whole-body scans; 1, 2, and 4 days postinjection) at our institution. SUVs were compared with the tumor-absorbed doses per injected activity (D/A0) of the subsequent first treatment cycle. RESULT(S): The correlation of SUV and D/A0 was r = 0.72 (SUVmean) and r = 0.71 (SUVmax), both P < 0.001. Pancreatic origin and hepatic localization were associated with higher D/A0, and chromogranin A level and Ki-67 index had no influence on SUV or D/A0. High-SUV lesions (SUVmean >15; SUVmax >25) resulted in high D/A0 (>10 Gy/GBq) in 66.7% to 70.8% and low D/A0 (<5 Gy/GBq) in only 8.3% to 12.5% on subsequent PRRT. The mentioned low D/A0 range, on the other hand, was achieved by all lesions with SUVmean <7 or SUVmax <9. CONCLUSION(S): Somatostatin receptor PET imaging may predict tumor-absorbed doses. The ability to indicate insufficient target irradiation by a low SUV could aid in selection of appropriate candidates for PRRT. However, larger series are needed to confirm and validate these initial findings. Â© 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
2718,"Neurotransmitter receptor expression by peripheral mononuclear cells: possible marker of neuronal damage by exposure to radiations. Peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) express several neurotransmitter systems. Increasing evidence suggests that PMC neurotransmitter receptors are involved in modulating immune responses. It is also thought that expression of PMC neurotransmitter receptors may reflect the status of homologous brain receptors. A problem encountered with assay of PMC neurotransmitter receptors was in developing techniques suitable for their assessment in spite of low density. In this paper we summarized findings on the expression of alpha1-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor subtypes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes characterized by radioligand binding assay techniques and immunocytochemistry. Human lymphocytes express alpha1A-, alpha1B- and alpha1D-adrenoceptor subtypes and dopamine D3, D4 and D5 receptors. Compared to radioligand binding assay, immunocytochemistry applied to cytospin-centrifuged peripheral lymphocytes allowed to assay receptor subtypes investigated in small amounts of blood. The development of sensitive and reproducible techniques for assaying PMC neurotransmitter receptor subtypes even in small amounts of blood such as those used for diagnostic purposes may allow to analyze their sensitivity to different conditions including radiation exposure.",Excluded
2685,"Imaging the back pain patient. Imaging is an integral part of the clinical examination of the patient with back pain; it is, however, often used excessively and without consideration of the underlying literature. The primary role of imaging is the identification of systemic disease as a cause of the back or limb pain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels at this. Systemic disease as a cause of back or limb pain is, however, rare. Most back and radiating limb pain is of benign nature, owing to degenerative phenomena. There is no role for imaging in the initial evaluation of the patient with back pain in the absence of signs or symptoms of systemic disease. When conservative care fails, imaging may be undertaken with due consideration of its risks: labeling the patient as suffering from a degenerative disease, cost, radiation exposure, and provoking unwarranted minimally invasive or surgical intervention. Imaging can well depict disc degeneration and disc herniation. Imaging can suggest the presence of discogenic pain, but the lack of a pathoanatomic gold standard obviates any definitive conclusions. The imaging natural history of disc herniation is resolution. There is very poor correlation between imaging findings of disc herniation and the clinical presentation or course. Psychosocial factors predict functional disability due to disc herniation better than imaging. Imaging with MRI, computed tomography (CT), or CT myelography can readily identify central canal, lateral recess, or foraminal compromise. Only when an imaging finding is concordant with the patient's pain pattern or neurologic deficit can causation be considered. The zygapophysial (facet) and sacroiliac joint are thought to be responsible for axial back pain, although with less frequency than the disc. Imaging findings of the structural changes of osteoarthritis do not correlate with pain production. Physiologic imaging, either with single-photon emission CT bone scan, heavily T2-weighted MRI sequences (short-tau inversion recovery), or gadolinium enhancement, can detect inflammation and are more predictive of an axial pain generator.",Excluded
1931,"Extracorporeal bubbles: a word of caution. OBJECTIVES: Gaseous microemboli (GME) are a cause of neurocognitive deficit postcardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, the measurement of microbubbles during cardiopulmonary bypass is not easy, because blood is an opaque fluid and contains microparticles. Recently, two new microbubble counters, the Gampt BC200 and the emboli detection and classification (EDAC) quantifier, were developed for use during cardiac surgery. The accuracy of both devices was validated against industrial standards.METHODS: A clear blood analogue (30%/70% glycerol-water) was pumped, by means of a rollerpump out of a partially filled arterial line screen filter with a nominal pore size of 20 microm. Downstream the pump, all test sensors and an optical cuvette, were inserted in a vertically mounted 3/8 inch tubing. Measurements were taken at flows of 405, 1080, 3000 and 6000 ml/min. Backlight shadowgraphy and optical counting were used as industrial reference techniques for measuring size and counts.RESULTS: On average the EDAC quantifier underestimates average bubble diameter by 35+/-1%, 13+/-8%, 71+/-7% and 33+/-4% at 405, 1080, 3000 and 6000 ml/min, respectively. The Gampt BC200 has good sizing agreement at 1080 ml/min (+5+/-17%) and 3000 ml/min (+33+/-6%) but overestimates average diameter by 220+/-40% and 295+/-49% at 405 and 6000 ml/min, respectively. Both devices only partially count the number of microbubbles at higher flows. At 3 l/min the EDAC counts 38%, the Gampt 18% of total counts and at 6 l/min both the EDAC and Gampt only count 3% of total counts.CONCLUSIONS: Both the EDAC and Gampt can be used in a clinical setting for monitoring basal GME production. However, both devices have some major limitations when used for studying 'worst case' scenarios. One should take great caution when correlating measured data with neurocognitive outcome. Finally, results obtained by one device in a first study cannot be compared nor exchanged with results from the other device in a second study.",Excluded

1710,"A simpler method for total scalp irradiation: the multijaw-size concave arc technique. The lateral electron-photon technique (LEPT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are commonly used for total scalp irradiation. However, the treatment planning and irradiation are laborious and time-consuming. We herein present the multijaw-size concave arc technique (MCAT) as a total scalp irradiation method that overcomes these problems. CT datasets for eight patients previously treated for angiosarcoma of the scalp were replanned using MCAT, LEPT, and IMRT. The MCAT was designed with a dynamic conformal arc for the total scalp, with a multileaf collimator to shield the brain. Two additional conformal arcs with a decreased upper-jaw position of the first dynamic conformal arc were used to reduce the cranial hotspots. The prescribed dose was 40 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV, defined as the total scalp plus a 4 mm margin). MCAT was compared with LEPT and IMRT with respect to the PTV dose homogeneity (D5%-95%), underdosage (V < 90%), overdosage (V > 110%), doses to the brain, and the delivery time and monitor units (MUs) for single irradiation. We were able to formulate treatment plans for all three techniques that could deliver the prescription dose in all patients. MCAT was significantly superior to LEPT with respect to PTV dose homogeneity, overdosage, and underdosage, although MCAT was inferior to IMRT with respect to dose homogeneity and overdosage. The mean brain dose and high-dosage volume of all three techniques were low, but IMRT provided larger volume to the brain than did the other two techniques in the low dosage region. In MCAT, the mean delivery time could be reduced by approximately half or more, and the mean MUs could be reduced by at least 100 compared to the other two techniques. MCAT can achieve total scalp irradiation with substantially fewer MUs and a shorter delivery time than LEPT and IMRT.",Excluded

METHOD(S): AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients > 1 month (median: 325 days) after resection and chemoradiation of a grade III or IV astrocytic glioma. All patients were followed for at least 1 year or until death after PET. Maximum standardized uptake values (AMT-SUVmax) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor on MRI. Unidirectional AMT uptake (K) was also quantified from dynamic PETand blood radioactivity data (available in 34 cases). Optimal cutoff thresholds for prediction of 1-year survival were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and survival of patients with above vs. below threshold values was evaluated in thewhole group, and in two subgroups (glioblastoma [n = 33], no further surgical or radiation treatment after PET [n = 22]). RESULT(S): For 1-year survival, sensitivity/specificity was 84%/80% for AMT-SUVmax and 76%/88% for lesion/cortex K-ratio, when using ROC-defined cutoff thresholds. Both AMT-SUVmax and K-ratio were highly prognostic for survival in all patient groups. Estimated median survival after PET was 966 and 876 days in the low, vs. 177 days in both the high AMT-SUVmax and high K-ratio groups, respectively (log-rank: p, > 001). Age- and gradecorrected Cox regression analyses showed a robust association between high AMT values and shorter overall survival after the PET scan (SUVmax: OR= 6.2 [2.2-17.5], K-ratio: OR= 6.6 [2.3-18.6]; p<= > 001). CONCLUSION(S): Focal increase of AMT uptake on PET has a strong prognostic value for 1-year and overall survival in patients with a previously treated high-grade glioma.",Excluded

3072,"Monte Carlo calculated output factors of a Leksell Gamma Knife unit. The Leksell Gamma Knife is a standard radiosurgical tool for treating brain lesions by directing beams of gamma radiation to a specific region. The diameter of the gamma beams is confined by collimator systems and available collimator sizes are 4, 8, 14 and 18 mm. The reduction in dose rate for each collimator helmet is called the output factor (OPF). Experimental determination of OPFs is difficult due to the extremely narrow beams for which the dose is determined. In the present work, the PRESTA version of the EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to obtain relative OPFs for the Leksell Gamma Knife for collimator sizes of 14, 8 and 4 mm (relative to that of the 18 mm collimator). A spherical probe with a radius of 1 mm was utilized in this computer experiment. Our Monte Carlo results gave OPFs of 0.974, 0.951 and 0.872 for the 14 mm, 8 mm and 4 mm collimators respectively, relative to the 18 mm collimator. Our calculated OPF for the 4mm collimator helmet was more than 8% higher than the value currently used, but in good agreement with the average of experimental values obtained by various Gamma Knife centres throughout the world and with the value now recommended by the manufacturer, Elekta (Elekta Instrument AB, Skeppargatan 8, S-114 52 Stockholm, Sweden).",Excluded
2361,"Gliosarcoma in the IDH era: Imaging characteristics of 25 patients with correlative immunostaining. Background: In the 2016 World Health Organizations Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, gliosarcoma (GSC) is considered a variant of IDH-wild type glioblastoma (GBM) characterized by a biphasic pattern with alternating areas exhibiting glial and mesenchymal differentiation. GSC can be primary or radiation-induced and is an intra-axial brain lesion which often abuts a dural surface. While some GSC have indistinguishable imaging characteristics from glioblastoma, aggressive lesions can erode through the dura and skull and involve the extra-cranial soft tissues. We present the largest known imaging series of GSC with immunohistochemical and histologic correlation, documenting them as IDH(-) and delineating their imaging spectrum. Method(s): Pathology proved GSC cases were collected from our quaternary care center spanning the last 16 years. IDH status was either documented or obtained by staining tissue blocks. When available, p53, PTEN, MIB-1, EGFR amplification status, and MGMT methylation status were recorded and imaging findings tabulated. Result(s): 25 cases were identified, 21 were De novo, and 4 were radiation-induced. All lesions contacted a dural or pial surface. All cases were negative for an IDH R132H mutation, including post-radiation GSC. 16/16 cases showed non-amplification of EGFR/CEP7. MGMT methylation was present in 2/17. Imaging features included areas of nodular thickening in necrotic lesions which appeared to abut the site of pial or dural contact. Conclusion(s): We present the largest reported imaging collection of GSC cases with correlative molecular and histologic testing.",Excluded

862,"Urinary, anorectal and sexual assessment after pelvic cancer surgery. Urinary, anorectal and sexual complications are often observed after pelvic cancer surgery. These symptoms may be secondary to a tumor compression or a specific surgical trauma of autonomic and somatic pathways involved in the bladder, bowel and sexual control. Indeed, pelvic organs are very close and share the same innervation, which plays an important role in the detrusor contraction, erectile function, pelvic floor contraction and global pelvi-perineal sensory functions. Moreover, pelvic irradiation and/or chemotherapy following specific surgery can also lead to neurogenic (myelopathy and plexopathy) lesions of centers and/or motor/sensory pathways, which control bladder and rectal functions. Specific bladder and rectal lesions secondary to irradiation are very common (chronic radiation cystitis, radiation rectitis). Sexual dysfunction from radiation therapy includes erectile dysfunction and vaginal stenosis. Urinary symptoms observed after pelvic surgery are principally characterized by voiding dysfunction with urinary retention or post void residual in case of neurogenic lesion. In some cases, overactive bladder symptoms (urge, frequency) are due to a radiation lesion of the bladder mucosa. Cystoscopy and urodynamic investigations are necessary to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms of these symptoms. Treatment of urinary retention is usually self-intermittent catherization and anticholinergic drugs can be used in case of overactive bladder. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can be used in male erectile dysfunction and vaginal dilators in case of vaginal stenosis. Perineal pain can be observed. Neurological mechanism is the main mechanism and can be confirmed by means of electrophysiological testing. This neuropathic pain can be managed by various treatments (drugs, TENS. . .).",Excluded

Fifteen patients initially irradiated for pituitary adenoma were subsequently treated with a second course of radiotherapy at the University of California at San Francisco between 1961 and 1989. The re-irradiation followed surgery in all but two cases. The median time to recurrence was 9 years (range 2-17) and median follow-up after the second course of radiotherapy was 10 years (range 1-30). The median initial radiation dose was 4084 cGy; that at recurrence was 4200 cGy. Local control has been maintained in 12 patients. One failed locally with a benign adenoma that was surgically salvaged. Two developed pituitary carcinomas which were poorly controlled. Of the patients who presented with visual abnormalities at the time of recurrence, 50% improved and the remainder stabilized after re-irradiation. There are no long-term visual complications. Hypopituitarism was present in nine patients prior to the second course of radiotherapy and developed in the remaining six patients after re-irradiation. Temporal lobe injury was seen in two patients. Careful analysis of each patient's pituitary and temporal lobe doses, intervals between treatments, treatment volume, neurets, relative decay factors, absolute decay factors, TDF and modified LQF values, and dose-volume relationships, revealed no correlation with complication or likelihood of local control. Repeat radiotherapy for recurrent pituitary adenoma with the doses used in these patients appears to carry acceptable risk with good local control.",Excluded
2904,"Spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: treatment outcome and prognostic factors. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord compression (SCC) is an important complication of metastatic prostate cancer. We have analysed patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors in this patients group.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of 69 patients with spinal cord compression and prostate cancer treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital.RESULTS: At presentation 40 (58%) patients were non-ambulant and 52% were catheterised. Diagnosis was established by myelography in 42% and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 47% of patients. MRI detected significantly more patients with multiple sites of compression (51 versus 7%, P < 0.001). SCC was present at the initial diagnosis of prostatic cancer in 13 patients and 17 patients had received no hormone treatment prior to diagnosis. Following treatment 36 (52%) patients had a functional improvement of motor power with 25/40 (63%) non-ambulant patients becoming ambulant. Seventy-seven percent of patients who had eventual improvement had some improvement in power within 7 days. On multivariate analysis a single level of compression, no previous hormone therapy and a young age (<65 years) predicted for better outcome. When these factors were included an increased radiation dose (>30 Gy) or the addition of surgery did not improve the functional outcome. Following initial recovery; there was a 45% risk of developing a further episode of cord compression at the same or new site by 2 years with a median time to progression of 236 days (range 47-1215 days). The median survival was 115 days (range 5-2016 days) with 25% of patients surviving for 2 years. Patients with no prior hormone therapy had a median survival of 627 days (range 46-1516 days). Other predictors of improved survival on multivariate analysis were a single site of compression and a haemoglobin over 12 g.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SCC in prostate cancer results in improved motor function in the majority of patients. Long-term survival is possible, especially in good performance status patients with no prior hormone treatment. Survivors remain at high risk of subsequent neurological relapse. An early improvement in motor power is a strong predictor of subsequent functional improvement. MRI detects additional sites of asymptomatic SCC which makes it the investigation of choice.",Excluded
131,"Biomedical applications of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectroscopy is the most straightforward-to-use technique for studying free radicals and other paramagnetic species and has therefore established itself in biomedical research and for clinical applications. EPR found its applications in oximetry, where this technique allows repeated measurements of oxygen in tissues-also in vivo and in combination with imaging techniques. The direct detection of paramagnetic species like transition metal ions by EPR allows elucidation of their specific roles in disease, for example how copper ions might be involved in the formation of amyloid- or amyloid-like fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases. For investigations on the structures of this protein aggregates, but also of other proteins or protein complexes with medical relevance the technique of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL)-the site-specific introduction of paramagnetic reporter groups into proteins or nucleic acids-is nowadays frequently used, especially in cases where other structural techniques are not applicable. Moreover, by direct detection of free radicals-also in combination with spin trapping methods, or application of SDSL, EPR spectroscopy can be also used for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in cancer diagnostics. This review gives an up-to-date overview about how EPR spectroscopy is currently used in biomedical research and clinical applications, with special emphasis on biomedical applications of SDSL EPR.

3179,"Electroretinographic Assessment of Inner Retinal Signaling in the Isolated and Superfused Murine Retina. PURPOSE: Longer-lasting electroretinographic recordings of the isolated murine retina were initially achieved by modification of a phosphate-buffered nutrient solution originally developed for the bovine retina. During experiments with a more sensitive mouse retina, apparent model-specific limitations were addressed and improvements were analyzed for their contribution to an optimized full electroretinogram (ERG).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retinas were isolated from dark-adapted mice, transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with different solutions. Scotopic and photopic ERGs were recorded with white flashes every 3 minutes. The phosphate buffer (Sickel-medium) originally used was replaced by a carbonate-based system (Ames-medium), the pH of which was adjusted to 7.7-7.8. Moreover, addition of 0.1 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> was investigated to reduce b-wave contamination by the slow PIII component typically present in the murine ERG.RESULTS: B-wave amplitudes were increased by the pH-shift (pH 7.4 to pH 7.7) from 22.9 +/- 1.9 microV to 37.5 +/- 2.5 microV. Improved b-wave responses were also achieved by adding small amounts of Ba<sup>2+</sup> (100 microM), which selectively suppressed slow PIII components, thereby unmasking more of the true b-wave amplitude (100.0% with vs. 22.2 +/- 10.7% without Ba<sup>2+</sup>). Ames medium lacking amino acids and vitamins was unable to maintain retinal signaling, as evident in a reversible decrease of the b-wave to 31.8 +/- 3.9% of its amplitude in complete Ames medium.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide optimized conditions for ex vivo ERGs from the murine retina and suggest that careful application of Ba<sup>2+</sup> supports reliable isolation of b-wave responses in mice. Under our recording conditions, murine retinas show reproducible ERGs for up to six hours.",Excluded
53,"Statistical properties of cerebral CT perfusion imaging systems. Part I. Cerebral blood volume maps generated from nondeconvolution-based systems. Purpose: The development and clinical employment of a computed tomography (CT) imaging system benefit from a thorough understanding of the statistical properties of the output images; cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) imaging system is no exception. A series of articles will present statistical properties of CTP systems and the dependence of these properties on system parameters. This Part I paper focuses on the signal and noise properties of cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps calculated using a nondeconvolution-based method. Method(s): The CBV imaging chain was decomposed into a cascade of subimaging stages, which facilitated the derivation of analytical models for the probability density function, mean value, and noise variance of CBV. These models directly take CTP source image acquisition, reconstruction, and postprocessing parameters as inputs. Both numerical simulations and in vivo canine experiments were performed to validate these models. Result(s): The noise variance of CBV is linearly related to the noise variance of source images and is strongly influenced by the noise variance of the baseline images. Uniformly partitioning the total radiation dose budget across all time frames was found to be suboptimal, and an optimal dose partition method was derived to minimize CBV noise. Results of the numerical simulation and animal studies validated the derived statistical properties of CBV. Conclusion(s): The statistical properties of CBV imaging systems can be accurately modeled by extending the linear CT systems theory. Based on the statistical model, several key signal and noise characteristics of CBV were identified and an optimal dose partition method was developed to improve the image quality of CBV.

1676,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report). Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC.",Excluded
130,"Controlled E-field gradient coils. Peripheral neural stimulation is a major problem in current gradient coil designs. Induced current problems in patients relate directly to gradient strength and modulation frequency. Current designs of gradient coil tend to limit ultra-high-speed imaging methods such as echo-planar imaging through the effect of induced currents which produce tingling sensations and involuntary muscle twitch. Neural stimulation could also trigger epileptic fits and/or cardiac fibrillation. For reduction of induced currents, an important aspect is the coil geometry. It is desirable to design the gradient coil in such a way as to prevent closed loop circulating currents within the body. Preliminary results using a four-sector gradient coil with rectangular geometry, operating in a low mutual coupling mode, indicate significant reduction in the E-field within the subject volume of the coil. Reduction in induced currents in the patient allows safer operation at higher magnetic field strengths together with faster scans currently prohibited through neural stimulation effects in standard coil geometries.",Excluded

Introduction: Treatment options for relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) post-chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T) are limited. Here, we report the successful treatment of R/R DLBCL with programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibition post-allogeneic CAR-T. Case Report: A previously healthy 26-year-old Caucasian man developed B-symptoms and cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy revealed DLBCL, activated B-cell subtype, double expressor and Ki-67 >80%. PET/CT scan revealed disease above and below the diaphragm. He achieved a partial response (PR) after R-CHOP, progressive disease (PD) after R-ICE, stable disease (SD) after R-ESHAP, and PD one month after autologous CD19-targeted CAR-T with CTL019 (CD3zeta/4-1BB). He then received R-lenalidomide (len) with radiation (24 Gy) to his mediastinal mass achieving a PR, followed by a myeloablative (Cy/TBI-12 Gy) allogeneic stem cell transplant (aSCT) from his 10/10 HLAmatched brother. He achieved 100% donor chimerism 30 days post-aSCT (D+30). Despite persistent full donor chimerism, D+60 PET/CT showed PD with confirmed relapse upon biopsy. Immunosuppression was discontinued, and ibrutinib with len was started, followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which led to a mixed response. He then continued on ibrutinib with weekly temsirolimus and received a second DLI achieving a PR, with PD shortly thereafter. He next proceeded to allogeneic CAR-T with axicabtagene-ciloleucel (CD3zeta/CD28), complicated by grade 1 cytokine release syndrome without neurotoxicity. Three weeks post-CAR-T, he developed diplopia due to a cranial nerve palsy. Brain MRI showed new pontine T2 changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for lymphoma and infection, but notable for T-cell predominance. One month postCAR-T, PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response (CMR). Repeat brain MRI was unchanged. Two months later, he developed dizziness and intractable nausea, and repeat brain MRI showed a new lesion in the inferior cerebellar vermis, with resolution of previous pontine change. Evaluation of the CSF and peripheral blood revealed no CAR T-cell persistence, and PET/CT confirmed disease relapse in the cerebellum and mediastinum. Patient then received focal radiation (24 Gy) to his cerebellar lesion along with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, after which his neurologic symptoms resolved. MRI one day after radiation showed near-complete resolution of enhancing vermis lesion. After 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, PET/CT showed a CMR, with no active disease on brain MRI. Three months into PD1-inhibition therapy, his disease remains in CMR, without GVHD nor treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion(s): This case illustrates the efficacy of allogeneic CAR-T after failure of autologous CAR-T and aSCT. Furthermore, PD1 inhibition can be used safely after allogeneic CAR-T, underscoring the need for prospective clinical studies. Copyright Â© 2018",Excluded

1524,"Frequent occurrence of therapeutically reversible CMV-associated encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain. BACKGROUND: Neurological decline during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain is often attributed to disease progression or side effects of radiotherapy. Diagnosis of opportunistic neurotropic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections is uncommon, even though high-grade gliomas and some brain metastases are known to contain CMV particles. We prospectively examined the frequency of CMV encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain.METHODS: Fifty patients requiring whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases (n = 27) or local radio(chemo)therapy of the brain for high-grade gliomas (n = 23) were observed in the prospective observational GLIO-CMV-01 study. MRIs and blood samples were obtained before, halfway through, and at the end of radiotherapy. MRIs were screened for disease progression or increased intracranial pressure. Blood was tested for anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M, anti-CMV IgG, and CMV DNA.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 50 (64%) patients were positive for anti-CMV IgG before radio(chemo)therapy. Fifteen of those 32 (48%) developed viremia during or up to 28 days after treatment. Thirteen of those 15 (87%) required treatment for CMV-associated encephalopathy. MRIs were negative for disease progression, edema, or bleeding. None of the patients negative for anti-CMV IgG developed viremia, suggesting a reactivation rather than a primary infection. In the group at risk consisting of anti-CMV IgG+ patients, age >65 (P = .004) and the amount of dexamethasone taken during radio(chemo)therapy (P = .004) were associated with an increased risk for CMV-associated encephalopathy. One hundred and fifty days after the start of radio(chemo)therapy, survival was 74% (14/19) (no encephalopathy) versus 54% (7/13) (encephalopathy) (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.03-1.86; P = .25).CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation frequently causes encephalopathy during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain.

1353,"Neurotransmitter receptors in brain regions of acrylamide-treated rats. II: Effects of extended exposure to acrylamide. Acrylamide was administered orally to 6 week old male rats in ten doses, spread over a two week period. At the two lower doses (5 and 10 mg/kg, total dose 50 and 100 mg/kg) effects on neurotransmitter receptor sites appeared confirmed to the striatum where both the dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exhibited enhanced binding twenty four hours after the last acrylamide dose. Other receptor sites within the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were not significantly altered. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg, given ten times), increases were also found for frontal cortical serotonin, medullary glycine, and cerebellar GABA receptor sites. The only unaffected receptor found was the cortical site for benzodiazepene. One week after the final acrylamide dose, the intensity of all ligands studied was not significantly different in treated and control groups. Thus, effects appeared reversible. Since striatal membrane protein concentration was reduced by treatment with rats with acrylamide, the observed increase in activity of muscarinic receptors could be best accounted for in terms of loss of striatal non-receptor protein rather than increased binding. However, the magnitude of increased striatal <sup>3</sup>H-spiroperidol binding in treated animals suggested an increase in overall binding capacity. An effect on dopamine neutrons was also suggested by a decreased responsiveness to apomorphine in rats treated with acrylamide at 10 mg/kg for 10 successive days; however, the effect had dissipated by 8 days after the final injection of acrylamide.",Excluded
1240,"Susceptibility-weighted imaging of the venous networks around the brain stem. Introduction: The venous network of the brainstem is complex and significant. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a practical technique which is sensitive to veins, especially tiny veins. Our purpose of this study was to evaluate the visualization of the venous network of brainstem by using SWI at 3.0 T. Method(s): The occurrence rate of each superficial veins of brainstem was evaluated by using SWI on a 3 T MR imaging system in 60 volunteers. The diameter of the lateral mesencephalic vein and peduncular vein were measured by SWI using the reconstructed mIP images in the sagittal view. And the outflow of the veins of brainstem were studied and described according to the reconstructed images. Result(s): The median anterior pontomesencephalic vein, median anterior medullary vein, peduncular vein, right vein of the pontomesencephalic sulcus, and right lateral anterior pontomesencephalic vein were detected in all the subjects (100 %). The outer diameter of peduncular vein was 1.38 +/- 0.26 mm (range 0.8-1.8 mm).

Barlow proposed that absolute visual threshold is limited by photon-like noise events in the rod photoreceptors, and he later extended the idea to explain the elevation of threshold following bright bleaching lights in terms of increased noise in the photoreceptors. Rushton, on the other hand, has proposed that the threshold elevation during dark adaptation involves changes not within the photoreceptors themselves but rather in the gain of a subsequent 'pool'. I report here measurements of outer segment current in individual rod photoreceptors which demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations occur at a greatly increased rate following bleaches of around 1%, and that these fluctuations have the form expected for random occurrences of the single photon events. This is consistent with Barlow's ideas but does not indicate whether a gain change subsequent to the receptors also occurs.",Excluded

Low-power, near-infra-red laser irradiation has been used to relieve patients from various kinds of pain, though the precise mechanisms of such biological actions of the laser have not yet been resolved. To investigate the cellular mechanisms by near-infra-red laser on the nervous system, we examined the effect of 830-nm laser irradiation on the energy metabolism of the rat brain. The diode laser was applied for 15 min with an irradiance of 4.8 W/cm(2). Tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content of the irradiated area in the cerebral cortex was 19% higher than that of the non-treated area, whereas the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content showed no significant difference. Laser irradiation at another wavelength (652 nm) had no effect on either ATP or ADP contents. The temperature of the tissue was increased by 4.4-4.7 degrees C during the irradiation of both wavelengths. These results suggest that the increase in tissue ATP content did not result from the thermal effect, but from a specific effect of the laser operated at the 830-nm wavelength.",Excluded
1189,"Radiotherapy for oligometastatic lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically presents at an advanced stage, which is often felt to be incurable, and such patients are usually treated with a palliative approach. Accumulating retrospective and prospective clinical evidence, including a recently completed randomized trial, support the existence of an oligometastatic disease state wherein select individuals with advanced NSCLC may experience historically unprecedented prolonged survival with aggressive local treatments, consisting of radiotherapy and/or surgery, to limited sites of metastatic disease. This is reflected in the most recent AJCC staging subcategorizing metastatic disease into intra-thoracic (M1a), a single extra thoracic site (M1b), and more diffuse metastases (M1c). In the field of radiation oncology, recent technological advances have allowed for the delivery of very high, potentially ablative, doses of radiotherapy to both intra- and extra-cranial disease sites, referred to as stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy (or SABR), in much shorter time periods compared to conventional radiation and with minimal associated toxicity. At the same time, significant improvements in systemic therapy, including platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, molecular agents targeting oncogene-addicted NSCLC, and immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibitors, have led to improved control of micro-metastatic disease and extended survival sparking newfound interest in combining these agents with ablative local therapies to provide additive, and in the case of radiation and immunotherapy, potentially synergistic, effects in order to further improve progression-free and overall survival. Currently, despite the tantalizing potential associated with aggressive local therapy in the setting of oligometastatic NSCLC, well-designed prospective randomized controlled trials sufficiently powered to detect and measure the possible added benefit afforded by this approach are desperately needed.

488,"Time course of photo-induced Egr-1 expression in the hypothalamus of a seasonally breeding songbird. Many seasonally-breeding species use daylength to time reproduction. Light-induced release of progonadal hormones involves a complex cascade of responses both inside and outside the brain. In this study, we used induction of early growth response 1 (Egr-1), the protein product of an immediate early gene, to evaluate the time course of such responses in male white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) exposed to a single long day. Induction of Egr-1 in the pars tuberalis began ~11h after dawn. This response was followed ~6h later by dramatic induction in the tuberal hypothalamus, including in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. At approximately the same time, Egr-1 was induced in dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus and in dopaminergic neurons of the premammillary nucleus. We noted no induction in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons until 2h after dawn the following morning. Overall, our results indicate that Egr-1 responses in GnRH neurons occur rather late during photostimulation, compared with responses in other cell populations, and that such induction may reflect new synthesis related to GnRH depletion rather than stimulation by light cues.",Excluded
3260,"Predictors of trigeminal neuropathy after radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas. Purpose To analyze the relationship between dosimetric characteristics and symptoms related to trigeminal neuropathy (TN) observed after radiosurgery (RS) for vestibular schwannomas (VS); to propose guidelines to optimize planification in VS RS regarding TN preservation; and to detail the mechanism of TN impairment after VS RS. Methods and Materials One hundred seventy-nine patients treated between 2011 and 2013 for VS RS and without trigeminal impairment before RS were included in a retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of TN among characteristics of the patients, the dosimetry, and the VS. Results There were 20 Koos grade 1, 99 grade 2, 57 grade 3, and 3 grade 4. Fourteen patients (7.8%) presented a transitory or permanent TN. Between the patients with and without TN after VS RS, there was no significant difference regarding dosimetry or VS volume itself. Significant differences (univariate analysis P<.05, Mann-Whitney test) were found for parameters related to the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve: total integrated dose, maximum dose, mean dose, volume of the Vth nerve (Vol<inf>v</inf>), and volume of the Vth nerve receiving at least 11 Gy (Vol<inf>Vcist>11Gy</inf>), but also for maximal dose to the Vth nerve nucleus and intra-axial portion (Dose max<inf>Vax</inf>). After multivariate analysis, the best model predicting TN included Vol<inf>Vcist>11Gy</inf> (P=.0045), Dose max<inf>Vax</inf> (P=.0006), and Vol<inf>v</inf> (P=.0058). The negative predictive value of this model was 97%.

3050,"Predictive biomarkers for improving radiation therapy. Radiotherapy is an important treatment modality for millions of patients with cancer worldwide. Current treatment decisions do not take into account individual patients' or cohorts of patients' sensitivities to this treatment modality. As such, patients treated with radiation therapy experience a large variation in normal tissue toxicity that results in doselimiting acute and irreversible progressive side effects. Important examples of these adverse effects include mucositis, pneumonitis, and cognitive damage, respectively representing acute, intermediate, and late effects. Stratification of patients based on radiation sensitivities will allow delivery of suitable alternative treatments to high-risk patients and dose escalation to tumors in less sensitive patients. Current focus on radiation biomarkers/biodosimeters appears to be primarily to assess radiation doses after catastrophic accidental radiation exposure. Recent advances have brought together several cross-disciplinary areas such as biological assays, analytical platforms, and algorithms to rapidly assess dose to individuals. These technologies are at different maturation levels. This immense progress is also an opportunity to use them to predict heterogeneity of radiation sensitivities among cancer patients to improve radiation therapy outcome and their quality of life. This talk will emphasize the need for discovery, development, and validation of predictive biomarkers, provide some examples of biomarkers, and discuss the translational challenges involved in leveraging advances in radiation-specific biomarker research to radiotherapy, which for the foreseeable future likely to remain a cornerstone of cancer treatment.",Excluded
3592,"Neuromagnetic responses to chords are modified by preceding musical scale. Previous psychological studies have shown that musical chords primed by Western musical scale in a tonal and modal schema are perceived in a hierarchy of stability. We investigated such priming effects on auditory magnetic responses to tonic-major and submediant-minor chords preceded by major scales and tonic-minor and submediant-major chords preceded by minor scales. Musically trained subjects participated in the experiment. During MEG recordings, subjects judged perceptual stability of the chords. The tonic chords were judged to be stable, whereas the submediant chords were judged to be unstable. Dipole moments of N1m response originating in the auditory cortex were larger in the left hemisphere for the submediant chords than for the tonic chords preceded by the major but not minor scales. No difference in the N1m or P2m moment was found for the chords presented without preceding scales. These results suggest priming effects of the tonal schema, interacting with contextual modality, on neural activity of the auditory cortex as well as perceptual stability of the chords. It is inferred that modulation of the auditory cortical activity is associated with attention induced by tonal instability and modality shift, which characterize the submediant chords.",Excluded
3148,"Patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells transfer mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes in tumor organoids. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer and its relapse after surgery, chemo and radiotherapy appears to be led by GBM stem cells (GSCs). Also, tumor networking and intercellular communication play a major role in driving GBM therapy-resistance. Tunneling Nanotubes (TNTs), thin membranous open-ended channels connecting distant cells, have been observed in several types of cancer, where they emerge to drive a more malignant phenotype. Here, we investigated whether GBM cells are capable to intercommunicate by TNTs. Two GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs) were obtained from the external and infiltrative zone of one GBM from one patient. We show, for the first time, that both GSLCs, grown in classical 2D culture and in 3D-tumor organoids, formed functional TNTs which allowed mitochondria transfer. In the organoid model, recapitulative of several tumor's features, we observed the formation of a network between cells constituted of both Tumor Microtubes (TMs), previously observed in vivo, and TNTs. In addition, the two GSLCs exhibited different responses to irradiation in terms of TNT induction and mitochondria transfer, although the correlation with the disease progression and therapy-resistance needs to be further addressed. Thus, TNT-based communication is active in different GSLCs derived from the external tumoral areas associated to GBM relapse, and we propose that they participate together with TMs in tumor networking.",Excluded
305,"Multiple myeloma with extramedullary dissemination to lung: A rare cause of pancoast syndrome. Introduction: Extramedullary plasmacytomas constitute 3% of plasma cell malignancies, and majority of which primarily occur in the head and neck. The occurrence of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma is less common. We report a case of multiple myeloma which presented as Pancoast syndrome due to extramedullary dissemination to lung. Case report: A 76-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with worsening of right shoulder pain for 2 days. He gave a 6 month history of sharp, persistent, right shoulder pain, radiating to medial aspect of arm and forearm associated with numbness and tingling. He subsequently underwent carpal tunnel release and ulnar nerve reposition surgeries. Examination revealed a hard, non mobile mass in the right supraclavicular fossa. Chest radiograph revealed a soft tissue density in the right lung apex and an extrapulmonary mass along the right lower chest wall (Image 1a). CT chest (Image 1b) and MRI spine (Image 1c) revealed multiple masses adjacent to the pleura on the right side and a large right apical lung mass involving the supraclavicular fossa, right posterior cervical space, prevertebral musculature with osseous and epidural invasion. A ultrasound guided biopsy of supraclavicular portion of the lung mass demonstrated neoplastic plasma cells (Image 2a). Serum and urine electrophoresis revealed monoclonal spike with IgG Lambda chains. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed multiple myeloma (Image 2b) and he was diagnosed with an unusual case of Pancoast syndrome caused by multiple myeloma with extramedullary dissemination to lung. He completed a course of palliative radiation to the right lung mass and is currently on bortezomib and prednisone. Discussion(s): Pancoast tumors are primarily non-small cell lung cancers. Multiple myeloma presenting as Pancoast syndrome is less common. The prognosis of these patients is poor. The typical thoracic manifestation of multiple myeloma is bony involvement of the thoracic cage. Other manifestations are pneumonia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, reticulonodular shadows, interstitial pattern and intrapulmonary calcification. Pancoast tumors, by their close vicinity to neurovascular structures like brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, often present with musculoskeletal pain and distal neurologic symptoms resulting in referral to orthopedicians or physiotherapists. Patients are initially treated for arthritis and bursitis of shoulder and a delay of 6-9 months have been reported in many cases before the tumor was discovered. We are reporting this case to emphasize the importance of including multiple myeloma in the work up of Pancoast syndrome. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

2354,"Lipoic and dihydrolipoic acids as antioxidants. A critical evaluation. A detailed evaluation of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of lipoic acid (LA) and dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) was performed. Both compounds are powerful scavengers of hypochlorous acid, able to protect alpha 1-antiproteinase against inactivation by HOCl. LA was a powerful scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (OH.) and could inhibit both iron-dependent OH. generation and peroxidation of ox-brain phospholipid liposomes in the presence of FeCl3-ascorbate, presumably by binding iron ions and rendering them redox-inactive. By contrast, DHLA accelerated iron-dependent OH. generation and lipid peroxidation, probably by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. LA inhibited this pro-oxidant action of DHLA. However, DHLA did not accelerate DNA degradation by a ferric bleomycin complex and slightly inhibited peroxidation of arachidonic acid by the myoglobin-H2O2 system. Under certain circumstances, DHLA accelerated the loss of activity of alpha-antiproteinase exposed to ionizing radiation under a N2O/O2 atmosphere and also the loss of creatine kinase activity in human plasma exposed to gas-phase cigarette smoke. Neither LA nor DHLA reacted with superoxide radical (O.2-) or H2O2 at significant rates, but both were good scavengers of trichloromethylperoxyl radical (CCl3O2.). We conclude that LA and DHLA have powerful antioxidant properties. However, DHLA can also exert pro-oxidant properties, both by its iron ion-reducing ability and probably by its ability to generate reactive sulphur-containing radicals that can damage certain proteins, such as alpha 1-antiproteinase and creatine kinase.",Excluded

The brains of wild-type (WT), untreated K3 and NIr-treated K3 mice, aged five months (thus after the onset of parkinsonian signs and neuropathology), were labelled immunohistochemically for the oxidative stress markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), hyperphosphorylated tau (using the AT8 antibody) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The average intensity and area of 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 immunoreactivity were measured using the MetaMorph software and TH+ cell number was estimated using stereology. Our results showed immunoreactivity for 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 within the SNc was increased in K3 mice compared to WT, and that this increase was mitigated by NIr. Results further showed that TH+ cell number was lower in K3 mice than in WT, and that this loss was mitigated by NIr. In summary, NIr treatment reduced the oxidative stress caused by the tau transgene in the SNc of K3 mice and saved SNc cells from degeneration. Our results, when taken together with those in other models, strengthen the notion that NIr treatment saves dopaminergic cells in the parkinsonian condition.",Excluded
71,"Rapid separation and quantitation of combined neutral and polar lipid classes by high-performance liquid chromatography and evaporative light-scattering mass detection. Modifications are described for an innovative and widely used high-performance liquid chromatography technique that resolves a very broad spectrum of lipids for quantitation by evaporative light-scattering detection. Substitution of acetone for 2-propanol in a portion of the solvent gradient program yields consistent resolution of diacylglycerol and cholesterol without sacrificing baseline resolution of the remaining major lipid classes. Moreover, previously noted instabilities in triacylglycerol retention time are eliminated. The introduction of acetone also enables a 20% reduction in flow-rate without an increase in total run time. As a further modification of the mobile phase composition, acetic acid and ethanolamine are substituted for the serine-ethylamine combination that was originally shown to improve column performance. The combination of acetic acid and ethanolamine yields the same result but the increased volatility of these solutes over serine results in decreased baseline noise. Finally, 1,2-hexadecanediol is introduced as an internal standard that is well suited for this method. The chromatographic performance obtained with these modifications is demonstrated in compositional analyses of lipid extracts from rat liver, heart, kidney and brain.",Excluded

749,"Late effects of intracranial radiation induces resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy that is partially reversible with CSF-1R inhibition. Primary and metastatic CNS malignancies remain incurable despite aggressive therapy with surgery and radiation. Immunotherapy has shown promise in many solid and hematologic malignancies, however, results have been disappointing in recurrent primary CNS tumors. Additionally, while upfront immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) has shown equal efficacy intracranially and extracranially, these responses are abrogated in previously irradiated brain lesions. Together, we hypothesize that radiation modulates the brain microenvironment to permit tumor growth and suppress anti-tumor immunity. As such, we developed a mouse model whereby orthotopic transplantation of murine gliomas into previously irradiated normal brain results in a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, the ICB-sensitive glioma cell line, GL261, is resistant to ICB therapy when implanted into a previously irradiated brain microenvironment. Immunophenotyping revealed a decreased ratio of CD8:CD4 T cells within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from previously irradiated mice though the relative frequency of neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells was slightly increased and no difference in PD-1 expression was observed. Alternatively, the frequency of microglia and tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was increased following irradiation suggesting a potential role for these myeloid cells in the immunosuppressive effects noted. Consistently, the administration of a CSF-1R inhibitor, which has been shown to reduce the number of microglia and block MDSCs, partially resensitizes GL261 cells to ICB therapy. In summary, we have developed a model that recapitulates the late effects of radiation on immunotherapy-resistance in CNS tumors. Preliminary results suggest that these late radiation effects are mediated through an increased myeloid population, and that inhibition of these cell subsets via the CSF-1R pathway can partially restore efficacy of ICB therapy. Furthermore, this model may provide further insight into additional therapeutic strategies that can be used to overcome these mechanisms of resistance induced by radiation therapy in the CNS.",Excluded
2801,"A preliminary comparative treatment planning study for radiotherapy of age-related maculopathy. PURPOSE: We present a comparative planning of different approaches for external radiotherapy in age-related maculopathies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calculated dose distributions and dose-volume histograms for (a) bilateral irradiation with 6 MV photons, (b) a single lateral-oblique beam using either photons, electrons or protons and (c) an anterior circular proton beam.RESULTS: For lateral photon or electron beams the dose to the lens is usually lower than 10% of the dose to the macula. The entrance doses for bilateral photon beams are about 50% which increase up to 100% at the orbital bone. About 5 mm of optic nerves are irradiated at the maximal dose while the optic chiasma is spared. A single photon beam gives 50% of the dose to the fellow eye. The electron beam spares the fellow eye but gives a rather inhomogeneous dose to the target volume. For a lateral proton beam, 4 mm of optic nerve receives 90% of the dose, the skin dose is at least 70% of the dose to the macula and the lens and the fellow eye are spared. An anterior proton beam gives 90% of the dose to 1 mm of optic nerve and the 50% isodose approaches the periphery of the lens.CONCLUSION: Doses to the critical structures can be dramatically diminished for all the techniques by reducing the beam size, but only if very precise set-up techniques are used. Proton beams are an attractive solution, but the impact of such a choice on the use of proton facilities and on the national health system should be carefully evaluated, as well as the risk of radio-induced secondary neoplasias.",Excluded

Materials/Methods: This is a single institution, retrospective review of 23 high risk medulloblastoma patients who were over 3 years old, had posterior fossa tumors, and had M+ disease. Six patients had M1 disease, 6 patients had M2 disease, and 11 patients had M3 disease. The median age at diagnosis of the 23 patients was 8 years (range, 3 - 15 years). The male/female patient ratio was 15:8. Patients were treated with concurrent chemotherapy and cranial spinal irradiation (3600 cGy), followed by boosts to gross disease or primary disease site of between 900 cGy to 1980 cGy. After radiation therapy patients were to be treated with chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 7.4 years (range, 0 - 15.2 years).

To further characterize and quantify a possible radiosensitization by BRAF inhibitors, blood samples of 35 melanoma patients were used for individual radiosensitivity testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization of chromosomal breaks after ex vivo irradiation.RESULTS: With radiotherapy and concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy the rate of acute radiodermatitis >=2degree was 36% and follicular cystic proliferation was seen in 13% of all radiotherapies. Non-skin toxicities included hearing disorders (4%) and dysphagia (2%). Following whole-brain radiotherapy, rates of radiodermatitis >=2degree were 44% and 8% (P < 0.001) for patients with and without BRAF inhibitor therapy, respectively. Concomitant treatment with vemurafenib induced acute radiodermatitis >=2degree more frequently than treatment with dabrafenib (40% versus 26%, P = 0.07). In line with these findings, analysis of chromosomal breaks ex vivo indicated significantly increased radiosensitivity for patients under vemurafenib (P = 0.004) and for patients switched from vemurafenib to dabrafenib (P = 0.002), but not for patients on dabrafenib only.

Electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal (GP) nerve (which innervates taste buds on the caudal 1/3 of the tongue) were recorded from single cells in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation was delivered as single pulses (n=55), paired-pulses (n=15) and tetanic trains (n=11). NTS cells with GP-evoked responses were also tested for responsivity to taste stimuli (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M quinine HCl). Fifty-five neurons were studied: 49 cells showed GP-evoked (mean latency+/-SEM=18.0+/-1.32 ms); seven of these were taste-responsive. Spontaneous rate of these cells was low (mean+/-SEM=1.4+/-0.3 spikes per second; median=0.21 spikes per second) and many cells showed no spontaneous activity. Paired-pulse stimulation of the GP nerve in 13 rats produced both paired-pulse suppression (n=11) and paired-pulse enhancement (n=4); tetanic stimulation (25 Hz, 1.0 s) produced sustained (>20 s) increases or decreases in firing rate in 7 of 11 cells tested. Histological data suggested that GP-evoked responses recorded in the most rostral NTS were likely the result of polysynaptic connections. Cells with GP-evoked responses formed a heterogeneous group in terms of their response properties and differed from cells with evoked responses to chorda tympani (CT; which innervates taste buds on the rostral 1/3 of the tongue) nerve stimulation.

Cox proportional hazard models were used to perform univariate (UVA) and multivariate analyses (MVA). Cause specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were plotted using cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meir curves, respectively.RESULTS: Of the 91% patients that presented with impaired voice, 73% noted significant improvement. Chronic laryngeal edema and dysphagia were noted in 18% and 7%, respectively.

2230,"Wirelessly powered endoscopically implantable devices into the submucosa as the possible treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a rather common disease with a prevalence reaching up to 10 or 20% in the western world. The most specific symptoms which point to the diagnosis of GERD are feelings of heartburn and the regurgitation of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus. However, a certain number of patients do not respond to standard therapy, and in these cases, it is necessary to resort to other treatment methods, such as laparoscopic fundoplication or electrostimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The aim of our work was to design and manufacture a miniature, battery-less stimulator to provide electric stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which could be implanted deep into the submucosa of the distal esophagus. The main goal was to provide a battery-less system as opposed to traditional battery neurostimulators to reduce the size and weight of the device. An electronic prototype of a wirelessly powered implantable device was developed. We used animal models for the experiments. The device is designed to treat GERD via electrical stimulation of the muscularis propria. It is implanted into the submucosal pocket by the lower esophageal sphincter with an endoscope. This method of implantation is superior to esophageal stimulators used today because of very low invasiveness of the surgery. Bipolar neurostimulation via two gold-plated leads is provided. The device does not have any source of energy; it is powered wirelessly which reduces the risk of potential battery leakage and reduces the overall dimensions. Copyright Â© 2019 J. Hajer et al.

Such conditions and eventual CNS changes might compromise the success of missions and the ability to cope with unexpected events and may lead to individual and long-term impairments.

945,"Exposure to different wavelengths of light and the development of structural and functional asymmetries in the chicken. The thalamofugal visual projections of the chick are known to develop in response to stimulation by light prior to hatching, and asymmetry in the number of projections develops as a consequence of the embryo being oriented in the egg so that it occuludes its left eye. The right eye only is stimulated by light and this causes the visual projections connected to the right eye to develop in advance of those connected to the left. We have now found that exposure of embryos, from day 19 of incubation to hatching, to red (peak transmission at 670 nm) or green (peak at 500 nm) light is as effective as broad-spectrum (white) light in establishing asymmetry in these projections. The intensities of the light to which the embryos were exposed in each case were equivalent, achieved in part by removing the air sac end of the egg shell. The thalamofugal visual projections, therefore, develop in response to light stimulation but appear to have no wavelength specificity. This result is consistent with the apparent lack of involvement of the thalamofugal visual pathway in colour vision. However, functional asymmetry, tested as left-right eye differences in categorising grain from pebbles, was found to be less marked in the chicks that had been exposed to green light compared to those that had been exposed to 'while' light, and it was absent in those exposed to red light or incubated in the dark. Thus, there is wavelength specificity for the development of the behavioural asymmetry, which suggests involvement of colour-coded neurons outside the thalamofugal visual pathway, probably in the tectofugal pathway. Exposure of the embryos to red and green light alternating at 30 min intervals is as effective as ""white' light for establishing both the structural and functional asymmetry.",Excluded
30,"Results of gamma knife radiosurgical treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. [French]. Gamma Knife treatments of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are performed for about 40 years. This article presents the results of 123 patients treated for a brain AVM at the Gamma Knife Center ULB-Hopital Erasme. Radiosurgical treatment is proposed following multidisciplinary discussion of the best therapeutic strategy based on specific parameters of the AVM. Gamma Knife irradiation was achieved for an AVM residue after endovascular embolization for 84 % of patients, after microsurgery for 7 % of patients, or after previous radiosurgical irradiation for 6 % of patients. The whole volume of the nidus was irradiated in a single session for all patients. A mean margin dose of 22.3 Gy was delivered to the nidus, which had a mean volume of 3.3 cc. The maximum dose ranged from 30 Gy to 50 Gy (mean 44.1 Gy). All patients were prospectively followed after treatment with serial angio-MR and/or conventional angiography. A retrospective analysis shows complete obliteration of the AVM for 109 patients (89 %) after 6 to 52 months (mean 32 months). For 14 patients the nidus was only partially obliterated from the radiosurgical procedure; for 9 patients a second irradiation was performed with subsequent complete occlusion of the AVM in all cases. So, 118 of 123 patients (96 %) irradiated by Gamma Knife in 1 or 2 sessions were cured. Four patients bled after irradiation and before complete occlusion of the AVM, with neurological deficit for 2 patients. Transient neurological symptoms develop after treatment for 12 patients (10 %), associated with postradic edema treated with corticoids. Permanent neurological worsening occurred in5 patients (4 %). Gamma Knife treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations is a highly efficient and low-risk therapy when used by a multidisciplinary team.",Excluded
262,"The natural history and radiation treatment of growing acoustic neuromas. Introduction: It is well known that a significant proportion of newly diagnosed acoustic neuromas (ANs) do not seem to change much on scans. There are less data on what happens to ANs that have initially been shown to grow on scans if left untreated. Radiation treatments can arrest growth of newly diagnosed ANs, but again, data are sparse that look specifically at the subset of ANs that have shown documented growth before radiation treatments. We reviewed our local experience with growing ANs, both what happens if left untreated and the control rate with radiation treatments. Result(s): Of those ANs that have been documented to have grown, 65% continued to grow, 30% stopped growing, and 5% decreased in size. After a mean follow-up of 60 months, 17% of the growing ANs treated with radiation continued to grow, 24% remained stable, and 59% reduced in size. Conclusion(s): There appears to be a subset of ANs that, despite showing initial growth, can stabilize in follow-up, and that radiation treatment does work but much less effectively when only those tumors that have documented prior growth are reviewed. There may be some support for the idea that radiation may be taking credit for what, in part, is the natural history of these tumors.",Excluded
315,The effect of laser hemotherapy on the acid glycosaminoglycan content of the liver and blood plasma in rats in the dynamics of an alcoholic coma. [Russian]. The aim of the study was determination of the content of acid glycosaminoglicans (GAG) in hepatic tissue and blood plasma of rats in the course of alcoholic coma and in response to laser irradiation of venous blood. The alcoholic intoxication was achieved by introduction of 40% ethanol through a metal probe into the stomach. The content of acid GAG was defined according to Diche. Alcoholic coma caused reduction of GAG levels in hepatic tissue and an increase in blood plasma which were correlated with the severity of neurological state. Laser irradiation of venous blood promoted a trend to normalization of GAG content in the investigated tissues. A relative reduction in GAG plasma levels after laser hemotherapy indicates effectiveness of the conducted therapy.,Excluded
3522,"Range modulation in proton therapy planning: a simple method for mitigating effects of increased relative biological effectiveness at the end-of-range of clinical proton beams. BACKGROUND: The increase in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of proton beams at the distal edge of the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) is a well-known phenomenon that is difficult to quantify accurately in vivo. For purposes of treatment planning, disallowing the distal SOBP to fall within vulnerable tissues hampers sparing to the extent possible with proton beam therapy (PBT). We propose the distal RBE uncertainty may be straightforwardly mitigated with a technique we call ""range modulation"". With range modulation, the distal falloff is smeared, reducing both the dose and average RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP.METHODS: One patient plan was selected to serve as an example for direct comparison of image-guided radiotherapy plans using non-range modulation PBT (NRMPBT), and range-modulation PBT (RMPBT). An additional plan using RMPBT was created to represent a re-treatment scenario (RMPBTrt) using a vertex beam. Planning statistics regarding dose, volume of the planning targets, and color images of the plans are shown.RESULTS: The three plans generated for this patient reveal that in all cases dosimetric and device manufacturing advantages are able to be achieved using RMPBT. Organ at risk (OAR) doses to critical structures such as the cochleae, optic apparatus, hypothalamus, and temporal lobes can be selectively spared using this method. Concerns about the location of the RBE that did significantly impact beam selection and treatment planning no longer have the same impact on the process, allowing these structures to be spared dose and subsequent associated issues.CONCLUSIONS: This present study has illustrated that RMPBT can improve OAR sparing while giving equivalent coverage to target volumes relative to traditional PBT methods while avoiding the increased RBE at the end of the beam. It has proven easy to design and implement and robust in our planning process. The method underscores the need to optimize treatment plans in PBT for both traditional energy dose in gray (Gy) and biologic dose (RBE).",Excluded
2395,"Characterization of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) brain-type fatty acid binding protein (fabp7) genes reveals the fates of teleost fabp7 genes following whole genome duplications. Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes. The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals, one (3R) at the base of the teleost radiation and another (4R) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids. We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein (fabp) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs. As previously described for zebrafish, we identified two copies (fabp7a and fabp7b) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt, but there was only a single transcript in northern pike, the closest relative of the salmonids, and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and grayling. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt, and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids. This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes. There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions. Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike. However, only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII, like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish, was expressed in the liver. A comparison of ~ 2000 bp upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62 bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII. The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver.

846,"Radiosurgical Lesionectomy For Cavernomas Associated With Drug Resistant Epilepsy. Purpose/Objective(s): Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain which cause hemorrhage and repetitive neurological deficits but the most frequent presenting symptom is epilepsy and is due to deposition of iron and blood products at the margin of the lesion. Microsurgical excision is preferred for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of SRS in seizure cessation for drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs. Materials/Methods: This retrospective single center study where in 11 patients with cortical or subcortical CMs located in highly functional areas with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these SRS procedures was 6yrs (+/-2.4) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 5 /month (+/-12). The mean marginal radiation dose was 18.5 Gy. Result(s): At median follow-up of 38mo, 54% were seizure free (Engel's class I), including 5 in class IA and 1 of the patients with occasional auras. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for 27% pts (class IIB). The remaining 19% patients showed little or no improvement. Outcomes were better for patients with simple partial seizures than for those with complex partial seizures. Location in the mesio-temporal region was associated with a poor outcome (2 of 11 patients), whereas location in the latero-temporal region was associated with a good outcome (5 of 11 patients). Location in the central region was also associated with an excellent outcome. Radiologically, 6 patients presented major reactional edema during the first year after SRS. In 2 of these patients, neuroradiological alterations were associated with clinical manifestations which included severe hemiparesis and speech impairment, but both patients fully recovered during the follow-up period with steroids. Post reactional edema correlates well with the response to the therapy. Conclusion(s): While radiosurgery role in controlling the bleeding in CM is controversial, it is a promising modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome.

1889,"Numerical evaluation of temporal focusing characteristics in transparent and scattering media. Temporal focusing is a simple approach for achieving tight, optically sectioned excitation in nonlinear microscopy and multiphoton photo-manipulation. Key applications and advantages of temporal focusing involve propagation through scattering media, but the progressive broadening of the temporal focus has not been characterized. By combining a detailed geometrical optics model with Monte-Carlo scattering simulations we introduce and validate a simulation strategy for predicting temporal focusing characteristics in scattering and non-scattering media. The broadening of the temporal focus width with increasing depth in brain tissue is studied using both simulations and experiments for several key optical geometries, and an analytical approximation is found for the dependence of this broadening on the microscope's parameters in a transparent medium. Our results indicate that a multiphoton temporal focus has radically different broadening characteristics in deep tissue than those of a spatial focus.",Excluded
2040,"Cranial nerve preservation and outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for jugular foramen schwannomas. OBJECTIVE: Jugular foramen region schwannomas are rare intracranial tumors that usually present with multiple lower cranial nerve deficits. For some patients, complete surgical resection is possible but may be associated with significant morbidity. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive alternative or adjunct to microsurgery for such tumors. We reviewed our clinical and imaging outcomes after patients underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for management of jugular foramen schwannomas.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with 35 tumors (one patient had bilateral tumors) underwent radiosurgery between May 1990 and December 2005. Twenty-two patients had previous microsurgical resection and all patients experienced various cranial neuropathies. A median of six isocenters were used. Median marginal and maximum doses were 14 and 28 Gy, respectively.RESULTS: None of the patients were lost to evaluation and the mean duration of follow-up was 83 months. Tumors regressed in 17 patients, remained stable in 16, and progressed in two. Five- and 10-year actuarial control rates were 97 and 94%, respectively. Preexisting cranial neuropathies improved in 20% and remained stable in 77% after radiosurgery. One patient worsened. The function of all previous intact nerves was preserved after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery proved to be a safe and effective management for newly diagnosed or residual jugular foramen schwannomas. Long-term tumor control rates and stability or improvement in cranial nerve function was confirmed.",Excluded

The Gamma Knife Icon (Elekta AB, Stockholm) is a cobalt-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) unit to support the use of a thermoplastic mask in lieu of a rigid frame, using an onboard cone-beam CT (CBCT) and an intrafraction motion management system (IFMM). We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients treated with Gamma Knife SRS from January 2018 to December 2019 at our institution using a mask-based immobilization system. Patient and treatment characteristics were collected and summarized as well as interfraction shifts and treatment-related outcomes. This dataset includes 124 patients with an associated 358 intracranial tumors. Twenty-four patients presented with primary brain tumors, which included 14 meningiomas and 10 other histologies, with 100 patients having brain metastases. Sixty tumors were post-operative, while 298 were intact. The median dose for primary tumors was 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter. Median patient follow-up was 6.28 months. 91% of patients with metastases maintained local control. Our early clinical experience has demonstrated limited toxicity profiles and high patient tolerance, which suggests that mask-based Gamma Knife SRS provides a safe alternative option for frameless SRS. Patients with large target volumes where fractionation is preferred or with small target volumes in non-eloquent areas can be considered for this approach. Response rates are encouraging, and continued follow-up is necessary to investigate long-term control and survival. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3385,"Vestibular adaptation to centrifugation does not transfer across planes of head rotation. Out-of-plane head movements performed during fast rotation produce non-compensatory nystagmus, sensations of illusory motion, and often motion sickness. Adaptation to this cross-coupled Coriolis stimulus has previously been demonstrated for head turns made in the yaw (transverse) plane of motion, during supine head-on-axis rotation. An open question, however, is if adaptation to head movements in one plane of motion transfers to head movements performed in a new, unpracticed plane of motion. Evidence of transfer would imply the brain builds up a generalized model of the vestibular sensory-motor system, instead of learning a variety of individual input/output relations separately. To investigate, over two days 9 subjects performed pitch head turns (sagittal plane) while rotating, before and after a series of yaw head turns while rotating. A Control Group of 10 subjects performed only the pitch movements. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and sensations of illusory motion were recorded in the dark for all movements. Upon comparing the two groups we failed to find any evidence of transfer from the yaw plane to the pitch plane, suggesting that adaptation to cross-coupled stimuli is specific to the particular plane of head movement. The findings have applications for the use of centrifugation as a possible countermeasure for long duration spaceflight. Adapting astronauts to unconstrained head movements while rotating will likely require exposure to head movements in all planes and directions. Â© 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

3536,"High-frequency afferent stimulation induces long-term potentiation of field potentials in the ventral tegmental area. Excitatory synapses on dopamine neurons in the VTA can undergo both long-term potentiation and depression. Additionally, drug-induced plasticity has been found at VTA synapses, and is proposed to play a role in reward-related learning and addiction by modifying dopamine cell firing. LTP at these synapses is difficult to generate experimentally in that it requires an undisturbed intracellular milieu and is often small in magnitude. Here, we demonstrate the induction of LTP as a property of evoked field potentials within the VTA. Excitatory field potentials were recorded extracellularly from VTA neurons in acute horizontal midbrain slices. Using extracellular and intracellular recording techniques, we found that evoked field potentials originate within the VTA itself and are largely composed of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSPs and action potentials triggered by activation of glutamatergic synapses on both dopamine and GABA neurons. High-frequency afferent stimulation (HFS) induced LTP of the field potential. The induction of this LTP was blocked by application of the NMDAR antagonist, d-APV, prior to HFS. As reported previously, glutamatergic synapses on GABA neurons did not express LTP while those on dopamine neurons did. We conclude that the potentiation of glutamatergic synapses on dopamine neurons is a major contributor to NMDA receptor-dependent LTP of the field potential. Field potential recordings may provide a convenient approach to explore the basic electrophysiological properties of VTA neurons and the development of addiction-related processes in this brain region.",Excluded
2187,"Effect of tumour depth on thermal neutron distribution in brain tissue. Neutron capture therapy in the treatment of brain tumors is a procedure consisting of localization within the tumor of a suitable nuclide having high thermal neutron cross section. When the tumor is irradiated by thermal neutrons which selectively interact with the localized nuclide, the ionizing radiation resulting from the reaction dissipates its energy within the tumor and destroys it, leaving normal tissue relatively unharmed. Ten minutes post injection of Boron 10 differential concentration between tumor and normal brain tissue was obtained as reported by Farr (1951). The differential concentration was found to be 3.3:1. In the present work a simulated tumor contained <sup>10</sup>B in a concentration of 50 mug/g tissue and the brain tissue bulk that fills up the skull in a concentration of 15 mug/g tissue. The dose imparted to the tumors was nearly 2.6 times that imparted to the ordinary brain tissue. The tumor was located first between 1-3.5 cm from the skull surface; secondly, it was located between 3.6-6 cm from skull surface. In each case it was observed that there was a sharp fall of neutron flux where the tumor was fixed. Such a sharp fall of neutron flux is anticipated due to the high boron content in the tumor. Gold foils were used as detectors for measuring neutron flux; after exposure in the neutron beam for some time the activity of <sup>198</sup>Au was measured on a Geiger Muller counter.",Excluded

Although it can be curative, the pre-transplant conditioning regimen can be associated with neurotoxicity. In this prospective study, we examined white matter (WM) integrity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological functioning before and one year after HSCT in twenty-two patients with hematologic disorders and ten healthy controls evaluated at similar intervals. Eighteen patients received conditioning treatment with high-dose (HD) chemotherapy, and four had full dose total body irradiation (fTBI) and HD chemotherapy prior to undergoing an allogeneic or autologous HSCT. The results showed a significant decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in diffuse WM regions one year after HSCT (p-corrected <0.05) in the patient group compared to healthy controls. At baseline, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had higher MD and AD in the left hemisphere WM than autologous HSCT patients (p-corrected <0.05). One year post-transplant, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere and left frontal WM compared to patients treated with autologous HSCT (p-corrected <0.05). There were modest but significant correlations between MD values and cognitive test scores, and these were greatest for timed tests and in projection tracts. Patients showed a trend toward a decline in working memory, and had lower cognitive test scores than healthy controls at the one-year assessment. The findings suggest a relatively diffuse pattern of alterations in WM integrity in adult survivors of HSCT.",Excluded

Analyses of the data by the method of cumulants and by a method for approximating the particle size distributions directly are presented. The latter method made possible unambiguous comparisons that revealed small but systematic dependences of vesicle size on composition in vesicles containing mixtures of egg phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, egg phosphatidylcholine and beef brain sphingomyelin, and in single lipid vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, and beef brain sphingomyelin.

3196,"Focused ultrasound-mediated suppression of chemically-induced acute epileptic EEG activity. BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is attributed to uncontrollable abnormal hyper-excitability of neurons. We investigated the feasibility of using low-intensity, pulsed radiation of focused ultrasound (FUS) to non-invasively suppress epileptic activity in an animal model (rat), which was induced by the intraperitonial injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ).RESULTS: After the onset of induced seizures, FUS was transcranially administered to the brain twice for three minutes each while undergoing electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. An air-backed, spherical segment ultrasound transducer (diameter: 6 cm; radius-of-curvature: 7 cm) operating at a fundamental frequency of 690 KHz was used to deliver a train of 0.5 msec-long pulses of sonication at a repetitive rate of 100 Hz to the thalamic areas of the brain. The acoustic intensity (130 mW/cm2) used in the experiment was sufficiently within the range of safety guidelines for the clinical ultrasound imaging. The occurrence of epileptic EEG bursts from epilepsy-induced rats significantly decreased after sonication when it was compared to the pre-sonication epileptic state. The PTZ-induced control group that did not receive any sonication showed a sustained number of epileptic EEG signal bursts. The animals that underwent sonication also showed less severe epileptic behavior, as assessed by the Racine score. Histological analysis confirmed that the sonication did not cause any damage to the brain tissue.CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that low-intensity, pulsed FUS sonication suppressed the number of epileptic signal bursts using acute epilepsy model in animal. Due to its non-invasiveness and spatial selectivity, FUS may offer new perspectives for a possible non-invasive treatment of epilepsy.",Excluded
3591,"High resolution dual-tracer brain SPECT with a new highperformance CdTe detector. Aims: Simultaneous dual-tracer brain imaging has the potential to shorten patient pathways in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, but the poor spectral resolution of conventional gamma cameras limits the utility of this technique. Solid state detectors offer improved capability to distinguish between two radioisotopes, and this has been exploited clinically in the field of nuclear cardiology. However, the technology has yet to be fully evaluated in the field of scintigraphic neuroimaging. We present imaging results for a new small-pixel CdTe detector in simultaneous dual-radioisotope scintigraphy of a brain phantom. Method(s): We have developed a new high-performance CdTe detector with an array of 80x80 pixels on a 250mum pitch, capable of imaging x-rays and gamma rays up to 200keV. The detector is fully spectroscopic, recording the energy of every interaction in each pixel of the detector, and the small pixel size affords very high spatial- and spectral- resolution. The detector has a wide range of applications in medical imaging, including x-ray diffraction tomography, x-ray k-edge subtraction and highresolution nuclear medicine imaging. The new detector has been characterised for radionuclide imaging. Using pinhole collimation, images have been acquired of a brain phantom containing both I-123 and Tc-99m. The hyperspectral dataset was subjected to corrections for inter-pixel charge sharing, variations in energy and uniformity response, and bad pixel interpolation. Images were created by applying energy windows to the spectral data. Images and spectra of the same phantom were also acquired with a conventional clinical gamma camera for comparison. For each image, the contrast and cross-talk between the two energy windows were quantified using regions of interest. Result(s): The CdTe system exhibits improved scatter rejection and greatly reduced cross-talk between the energy windows for the two radioisotopes, resulting in enhanced image contrast. These characteristics will allow for better accuracy for quantitative imaging in a dual-tracer setting, which has particular importance in brain imaging. We also demonstrate the ability of the detector to resolve low-energy fluorescence x-rays from the radioactive source. The system has a high efficiency for detection of these low-energy photons, and incorporating these events into image reconstruction may boost the sensitivity, reducing image noise. Conclusion(s): Small-pixel CdTe detectors are a promising prospect in multi-tracer SPECT imaging. We present future plans to develop the instrument, with a tiled array of detectors with minimal dead-space to increase the field of view and improved collimators to further increase the sensitivity of the system.",Excluded

Planarians have robust regenerative ability dependent on X-ray-sensitive pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts. Here, we report that planarians can regenerate dopaminergic neurons after selective degeneration of these neurons caused by treatment with a dopaminergic neurotoxin (6-hydroxydopamine; 6-OHDA). This suggests that planarians have a system to sense the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and to recruit stem cells to produce dopaminergic neurons to recover brain morphology and function. We confirmed that X-ray-irradiated planarians do not regenerate brain dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA-induced lesioning, suggesting that newly generated dopaminergic neurons are indeed derived from pluripotent stem cells. However, we found that the majority of regenerated dopaminergic neurons were 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-negative cells. Therefore, we carefully analyzed when proliferating stem cells became committed to become dopaminergic neurons during regeneration by a combination of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, immunostaining/in situ hybridization, and 5-fluorouracil treatment. The results strongly suggested that G(2) -phase stem cells become committed to dopaminergic neurons in the mesenchymal space around the brain, after migration from the trunk region following S-phase.

2166,"Achieving sub cm CTV-PTV margin in pelvic treatments: Radiographers learning curve. Aims: Image guidance is not always feasible or available for standard/ conformal treatments and so, offline portal image measurements help define population based CTV-PTV margins. Reproducibility in pelvis is aided by the use of ankle- and/or knee-indexed supports available in standard sizes generally suiting the needs of taller western patients. Radiographers need to be convinced of the importance for use of one/more positional devices as this adds to setup effort and time. Different permutations of aligning the pelvis and positional aids, resident supervised or not are reported for patients treated for cancer of the cervix/endometrium. Method(s): Patients were aligned using lasers/field lights to either anterior field center (conventional alignment) or to mid line tattoo over mons pubis keeping constant 10 cm table top to vertical height for all setups using either standard ankle or knee plus ankle positioning device. Localization CT scanbased digitally reconstructed radiographs were used as reference to compare with portal imaging acquired generally in pattern of 3 in 1st week and weekly thereafter. The van Herk formula was used to compute CTV-PTV margin from anterior and lateral image projections to give mediolateral (ML), cranio-caudal (CC) and antero-posterior (AP) margins. Result(s): The initial pelvic alignment were done in the presence of a resident doctor using ankle positioning by two different alignment methods: conventional and setup (4 cm cranial offset from reference tattoo at mons pubis). The corresponding PTV margin in ML direction was 1.6 cm versus 0.9 cm, CC 1.2 cm versus 1.1 cm respectively and in AP was identical at 0.7 cm. Subsequently, with radiographers by themselves, PTV margins were 1.1 cm versus 0.9 cm for ML, 1.1 cm versus 1.5 cm, CC and 1.0 cm versus 0.9 cm in AP direction for conventional and setup alignment respectively. An increase in CC margin was seen for setup arm. The radiographers were given feedback and setup reproducibility was assessed for next 13 patients treated with a similar setup protocol. The PTV margins for this group in CC showed improvement to 1.1 cm, ML was 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm in AP directions. A knee-positioning device was introduced with ankle for patient alignment with setup protocol. An increase in PTV margin to 1.4 cm was calculated for ML with modest decrease in CC at 0.8 cm and 0.9 cm for AP direction with use of two devices. The standard knee device was abandoned as use of two devices was perceived as cumbersome and unsuitable in height for patients.

The 17 patients with reductions of more than 50% in brain edema volume had single metastases. Edema volume in the nine patients with two brain metastases remained stable in five patients (volume change <10%, 0-2 cc) and increased in four patients (by >10%, 2-14 cc). In a subanalysis of eight metastases with baseline edema volume greater than 40 cc, edema volume decreased from 77.27+/-37.21 cc to 24.84+/-35.6 cc (p=0.034). Reductions in brain edema were greater in metastases for which non-small-cell lung carcinoma and breast cancers were the primary diseases. Overall, symptoms improved in most patients. No patients who were without symptoms or who had no signs of increased intracranial pressure at baseline developed signs of intracranial pressure following LINAC radiosurgery. In this series, LINAC stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic brain lesions resulted in early reduction in brain edema volume in single metastasis patients and those with large edema volumes, and reduced the need for steroids.",Excluded

209,"Accurate event-driven motion compensation in high-resolution PET incorporating scattered and random events. With continuing improvements in spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, small patient movements during PET imaging become a significant source of resolution degradation. This work develops and investigates a comprehensive formalism for accurate motion-compensated reconstruction which at the same time is very feasible in the context of high-resolution PET. In particular, this paper proposes an effective method to incorporate presence of scattered and random coincidences in the context of motion (which is similarly applicable to various other motion correction schemes). The overall reconstruction framework takes into consideration missing projection data which are not detected due to motion, and additionally, incorporates information from all detected events, including those which fall outside the field-of-view following motion correction. The proposed approach has been extensively validated using phantom experiments as well as realistic simulations of a new mathematical brain phantom developed in this work, and the results for a dynamic patient study are also presented.",Excluded

The mainstay of treatment is high dose irradiation. Complications from radiotherapy are not uncommon especially to those nearby structures such as vertebrae and spinal cord. A 57 year-old gentleman with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who was treated with chemo-radiation (total of 35 fractions,70Gy) presented to us 6 months post therapy with bilateral nasal discharge and progressive neck stiffness. Nasoendoscopy showed inflamed nasophayngeal mucosa and Computed Tomography (CT) brain and cervical spine showed retropharyngeal and anterior epidural collection with extension into atlantoaxial bone and spinal cord compression. Histopathological specimen revealed features of chronic inflammations with multiple actinomycetes colonies. Our patient suffered severe neck stiffness and loss of sensations on both upper limbs. He was treated conservatively with Halo vest and intravenous antibiotics for 8 weeks and recovered fully. Irradiation in NPC is known to cause devastating complications to cervical spine such as osteoradionecrosis, osteomyelitis. It also renders tissues hypoxic and risk of getting rare infection like actinomycosis. This report can represent a great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with differentials of tumor recurrence, osteoradionecrosis or osteomyelitis.

399,"Percutaneous fixation of thoracolumbar fractures. Does index level fixation help in fracture reduction and stability?. Introduction: Thoracolumbar burst fractures are caused by compression injury with subsequent loss of vertebral height and development of local kyphotic deformity. The application of pedicle screws in the fractured vertebrae i.e. index level fixation, had been proven to help in reduction and correction of the local kyphotic deformity and anterior vertebral height loss with their maintenance in short segment fixation. Recently, percutaneous pedicle screws are introduced and used in the thoracolumbar fracture fixation with the proposed advantage of the less soft tissue dissection, muscle disruption and atrophy and assumed less wound related complications. Controversy remains about the ability of the percutaneous instrumentation to reduce and maintain the correction of local kyphosis and lost vertebral height caused by the fracture compared to the open instrumentation. Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective study, thirty-eight neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (T11-L2) type A3 and A4 according to AOSpine classification were treated between 2012 and 2015 with posterior pedicle screw fixation. The patients were divided into two groups, group 1 included 18 patients treated with percutaneous pedicle screws (PPS) while group 2 included 20 patients treated by standard open posterior approach with pedicle screws fixation (OPS). The operative data (blood loss, radiation exposure, operative time, and cost of implants) were compared between the two groups. The patients' radiographs were assessed for local kyphotic angle (LKA) and anterior vertebral body height (AVH) compression and compared for correction and maintenance. The patients' visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain and treatment related complications were reported. Result(s): The blood loss was the only operative parameter that was significantly less in the PPS group and although the operative time decreased in the PPS group by the increase in learning curve, the other operative data show significant difference in favor of the OPS group. Post-operative correction of the local vertebral compression assessed radiologically with LKA and AVH significantly improved in both groups compared to the pre-operative degree and was maintained till the end of follow up. No major wound related complication was found in both groups. VAS of back pain was significantly reduced in PPS group in the early postoperative follow up than the OPS, but both groups at the end showed a significant improvement between early post-operative and late follow up. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is a good minimally invasive modality in the management of thoracolumbar fractures and the application of screw in the fractured vertebrae improves the correction and maintenance of local kyphosis in short segment fixation. Cost effectiveness of this technique must be evaluated thoroughly with the final and late outcome of this management. More randomized controlled and multicenter studies are needed to support these findings.",Excluded

128,"Anxiety and cognition in histamine H3 receptor-/- mice. Histamine H(3) receptors (H3Rs) were first characterized as autoreceptors modulating histamine release and synthesis via negative feedback. Acute H3R stimulation or blockade with selective agonists and antagonists suggests a role for H3R in anxiety and cognition. However, little is known about the long-term effects of H3R blockade on brain function. In the current study, mice lacking H3 receptors (H3R(-/-)) were used to investigate the role of H3R-mediated signalling in anxiety and cognition. H3R(-/-) mice showed enhanced spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze. In addition, H3R(-/-) mice showed reduced measures of anxiety in the elevated plus and zero mazes involving exploratory behaviour and avoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli, but enhanced acoustic startle responses involving unavoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli. These behavioural alterations were associated with higher arginine vasopressin levels in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. These findings support a role for H3Rs in mediating histamine effects on spatial learning and memory and measures of anxiety.",Excluded

365,"Nitric oxide and its influence on oscillations of collicular responses in developing rats. We investigated the influence of modulating NO synthesis on oscillatory components of ON and OFF evoked field potentials in developing rat superior colliculus. Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in neuronal transmission by adjusting neurotransmitter release in adults and in stabilizing synaptic connections in developing brains. NO synthesis was decreased by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with an acute microinjection of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME); whereas NO synthesis was augmented by an acute microinjection of L-arginine (L-ARG). The study is focused on rhythmic activity by analyzing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Collicular responses were recorded in anesthetized rats, at post-natal days (PND) 13-19 and adults. This time window was chosen because it is centered on eye opening. NO down- and upregulation resulted in a dual effect depending on age and response-type. NO synthesis inhibition decreased the magnitude of oscillations in ON responses in the youngest animals (PND13-PND14), whereas oscillations of frequencies higher than 20 Hz in OFF responses were increased in all age groups of developing rats. In adults NO downregulation increased oscillations in ON responses and decreased oscillations in OFF responses. L-arginine application produced effects opposite to those seen with L-NAME. Our data together with results reported in the literature suggest that the temporal patterns of the evoked activity are NO-dependent. This sculpting action of the evoked firing may play a role in the synchronization of action potentials in afferent axons which in turn contributes to synaptic stabilization.",Excluded
903,"Carotid ultrasound identifies high risk subclinical atherosclerosis in adults with low framingham risk scores. BACKGROUND: Worldwide, cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality. Although effective in predicting CV risk in select populations, the Framingham risk score (FRS) fails to identify many young individuals who experience premature CV events. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or plaque, a marker of atherosclerosis and predictor of CV events, in young asymptomatic individuals with low and intermediate FRS (<2% annualized event rate) using the carotid ultrasound protocol recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Vascular Medicine.METHODS: Individuals aged < or = 65 years not taking statins and without diabetes mellitus or histories of coronary artery disease underwent CIMT and plaque examination for primary prevention. Clinical variables including lipid values, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and FRS and subsequent pharmacotherapy recommendations were retrospectively collected for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Of 441 subjects (mean age, 49.7 + or - 7.9 years), 184 (42%; 95% confidence interval, 37.3%-46.5%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (CIMT > or = 75th percentile adjusted for age, gender, and race or presence of plaque). Of those with the lowest FRS of < or =5% (n = 336) (mean age, 48.0 + or - 7.6 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), 127 (38%; 95% confidence interval, 32.6%-43.0%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings. For individuals with FRS < or = 5% and high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (n = 127; mean age, 47.3 + or - 8.1 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), lipid-lowering therapy was recommended by their treating physicians in 77 (61%).CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-eight percent of asymptomatic young to middle-aged individuals with FRS < or = 5% have abnormal carotid ultrasound findings associated with increased risk for CV events. Pharmacologic therapy for CV prevention was recommended in the majority of these individuals. The lack of radiation exposure, relatively low cost, and ability to detect early-stage atherosclerosis suggest that carotid ultrasound for CIMT and plaque detection should continue to be explored as a primary tool for CV risk stratification in young to middle-aged adults with low FRS.",Excluded
1404,"Habituation of steady-state visual evoked potentials in response to high-frequency polychromatic foveal visual stimulation. In an attempt to develop safe and robust methods for monitoring migraineurs' brain states, we explores the feasibility of using white, red, green and blue LED lights flickering around their critical flicker fusion (CFF) frequencies as foveal visual stimuli for inducing steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and causing discernible habituation trends. After comparing the habituation indices, the multi-scale entropies and the time dependent intrinsic correlations of their SSVEP signals, we reached a tentative conclusion that sharp red and white light pulses flickering barely above their CFF frequencies can replace commonly used 13Hz stimuli to effectively cause SSVEP habituation among normal subjects. Empirical results showed that consecutive short bursts of light can produce more consistent responses than a single prolonged stimulation. Since these high frequency stimuli do not run the risk of triggering migraine or seizure attacks, further tests of these stimuli on migraine patients are warranted in order to verify their effectiveness.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The present study was performed to investigate the effect of crocin on blue light- and white light-induced rod and cone death in primary retinal cell cultures.METHODS: Primary retinal cell cultures were prepared from primate and bovine retinas. Fifteen-day-old cultures were exposed to blue actinic light or to white fluorescent light for 24 hours. Cultures were treated by the addition of different concentrations of crocin for 24 hours before light exposure or for 8 hours after light exposure. Cultures kept in the dark were used as controls. Green nucleic acid stain assay was used to evaluate cell death. Rods and cones were immunolabeled with specific antibodies and counted. TUNEL labeling was used to detect fragmented DNA in fixed cells after light exposure.RESULTS: Primary retinal cell cultures contained a mixture of retinal cells enriched in photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Muller cells. Twenty-four-hour exposure to blue and white light induced death in 70% to 80% of the photoreceptors in bovine and primate retinal cell cultures. Crocin protected the photoreceptors against blue light- or white light-mediated damage in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of approximately 30 microM. TUNEL assays confirmed that crocin protected photoreceptors from light damage.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that blue and white light selectively induce rod and cone cell death in an in vitro model.

2278,"Acid-induced unfolding of brain-derived neurotrophic factor results in the formation of a monomeric ""a state"". Recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor in acid undergoes a slow loss of tertiary structure as monitored by both near-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence, and appears to retain some secondary structure, as monitored by far-UV circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This loss of tertiary structure parallels a decrease in the weight average molecular weight, from dimer to monomer, when examined using light scattering. Increasing the temperature accelerates this slow reaction. This process may be described most simply as N2 in equilibrium with 2D where N and D are the native and denatured forms of the protein, respectively. However, the acid denaturation strongly depends on the protein concentration, with higher concentration resulting in a lower rate and extent of denaturation. This suggests that the more complicated mechanism N2 in equilibrium with 2N in equilibrium with 2D more accurately describes the denaturation, where the dissociation into a native monomer is the rate-limiting step, and the conversion of N to D occurs relatively rapidly. Size-exclusion chromatography (at neutral pH) at several points during denaturation further demonstrated that the amount of tertiary structure remaining paralleled the dimer concentration and also that the monomer form was long-lived, remaining as monomer during the course of the chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity determination indicated that the acid-denatured form is a compact molecule. On the basis of the above data, the acid-denatured form may be considered to be a monomeric compact intermediate A state with no tertiary structure but considerable secondary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

Although protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is important for hippocampus-dependent learning, its role in cerebellum-dependent learning remains unclear.

In the present study, we generated PTPMEG-knockout (KO) mice, and addressed whether PTPMEG is involved in cerebellar plasticity and cerebellum-dependent learning. The structure of the cerebellum in PTPMEG-KO mice appeared grossly normal. However, we found that PTPMEG-KO mice showed severe impairment in the accelerated rotarod test. These mice also exhibited impairment in rapid acquisition of the cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, in which conditioned stimulus (450-ms tone) and unconditioned stimulus (100-ms periorbital electrical shock) were co-terminated. Moreover, long-term depression at parallel fiber-PC synapses was significantly attenuated in these mice. Developmental elimination of surplus climbing fibers and the physiological properties of excitatory synaptic inputs to PCs appeared normal in PTPMEG-KO mice. These results suggest that tyrosine dephosphorylation events regulated by PTPMEG are important for both motor learning and cerebellar synaptic plasticity.",Excluded

The previously reported increased sensitivity to painful stimuli subsequent to medial forebrain bundle lesions or para-chlorophenylalanine administration, therefore, does not appear to be due exclusively to disruption of ascending 5-HT fibers originating in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei.

PURPOSE: Although gene expression profiling provides critical information, knowledge remains limited regarding the differential effects of molecular subtype on clinical course. This study evaluated the impact of molecular status on long-term patterns of failure in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We analyzed data from 1181 individuals with invasive breast cancer undergoing surgery plus PORT from 2003 to 2011. Molecular subtypes were defined as luminal A (LA), luminal B (LB)-HER2(-), LB-HER2(+), HER2, and triple-negative (TN) based on the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus criteria. Competing risks analysis and baseline hazard rate function plots were used to explore subtype-specific recurrence patterns.RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival rates of LA, LB-HER2(-), LB-HER2(+), HER2, and TN groups were 96, 93, 94, 84, and 85%, respectively (P < 0.001). Distant metastatic events differed significantly according to molecular subtype (P < 0.001). In competing risks regression analysis, initial development of distant metastasis was the highest with TN tumors, followed by HER2, LB-HER2(-), and LB-HER2(+) subtypes (P = 0.005). Regarding preferential sites of distant metastasis, the risk of initial brain metastasis was significantly higher with HER2 tumors, followed by TN tumors (P = 0.001). A low-level but sustained metastatic risk increment was observed in luminal tumors, whereas TN and HER2 subtypes showed a short-term risk surge within 5 years.CONCLUSION: From the significant impact of molecular profile on distant metastasis, subtype-specific individualization of systemic treatment and close surveillance are suggested. The preferential and long-term risk of brain metastasis in the HER2 subtype underlines the importance of alternative anti-HER2 therapies.",Excluded

OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in treating patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Preliminary results of this study were previously reported. The updated results are reported in this paper.METHODS: Ninety seven patients with TN refractory to medical or surgical management underwent GKS between September 1998 and October 2005. Fifteen patients had multiple sclerosis (MS). The radiation dose was escalated from 70 to 99 Gy. The Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Scale (BNIPS) was used to assess pain before and after GKS. Eighty-four patients were available for evaluation with a mean follow up of 8.9 months. The overall response and complete response rates were 70.2% and 36.9%, respectively. At 12 months, there was a greater improvement in BNIPS scores for patients who were treated with two isocenters compared with those treated with a single isocenter. The mean percentage of pain decrease was 56.26% compared with 11.53% (p < 0.001). Patients treated with two isocenters rather than one and patients receiving greater than 85 Gy compared with lower doses had a longer duration of response. Only nine patients (11%) had mild numbness attributable to the GKS. Five of the nine patients experienced complete resolution of facial numbness on follow up. Patients with MS have a shorter duration of response compared with those without MS (p = 0.35).CONCLUSIONS: These updated results show that GKS continues to be an effective therapy for TN. It appears there is an enhanced response with doses 85 Gy or more and with two isocenters without increased complications.",Excluded

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to various tissues. There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage.

390,"A novel LITT treatment planning system to optimize laser ablation delivery to brain targets. Purpose: Laser interstitial thermal therapy, or LITT, is a minimally invasive stereotactic tumor ablative technique. One application is treating intracranial targets. LITT systems use a laser energy probe that can be inserted into the patient, emitting near infrared laser radiation that induces necrosis in clinical targets while providing thermal damage updates via MR thermometry. The rigid laser probes range two and three mm in diameter, through which the thermal energy efficiently emits along straight-line pathways. The systems allow for varying dwell times and rates of energy deposition to assist in the ability to maximize the thermal damage to the target tissues while minimizing the damage to normal tissues. For targets that cannot be treated along a linear trajectory, multiple trajectories are necessary. However, planning systems, like those available in ionizing radiation delivery, are all but absent from the clinical setting. The goals of this project aim to provide a planning system to allow the optimization of the laser trajectory. Method(s): Twelve patients who underwent LITT therapy using traditional approaches, where the surgeon decided on laser trajectory by inspection of orthogonal radiology images were post procedure planned using a rudimentary system of LITT planning. Starting with a stereotactic planning system, a thermal dose kernel was developed. This effort has provided a rudimentary tool that yields first estimates for optimized LITT. Result(s): A conformal index was developed and evaluated for each planning technique. The average index for the simple inspection of orthogonal images based on thermal dose threshold lines was 88.4% while the conformal index of the planning system were 46.2%. Conclusion(s): As with ionizing radiation, it is anticipated that this increase in thermal optimization will translate into better tumor control and lower complications.

2180,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded
2074,"Non tumor perfusion changes following stereotactic radiosurgery to brain metastases. Purpose: To evaluate early perfusion changes in normal tissue following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): Nineteen patients harboring twenty-two brain metastases treated with SRS were imaged with dynamic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (DSC MRI) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month post SRS. Relative cerebral blood volume and flow (rCBV and rCBF) ratios were evaluated outside of tumor within a combined region of interest (ROI) and separately within gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) ROIs. Threedimensional dose distribution from each SRS plan was divided into six regions: (1) <2 Gy; (2) 2-5 Gy; (3) 5-10 Gy; (4) 10-12 Gy; (5) 12-16 Gy; and (6) >16 Gy. rCBV and rCBF ratio differences between baseline, 1 week and 1 month were compared. Best linear fit plots quantified normal tissue dose-dependency. Result(s): Significant rCBV ratio increases were present between baseline and 1 month for all ROIs and dose ranges except for WM ROI receiving <2 Gy. rCBV ratio for all ROIs was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month with the greatest changes occurring within the 5-10 Gy dose range (53.1%). rCBF ratio was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month for all ROIs within the 5-10 Gy dose range (33.9-45.0%). Both rCBV and rCBF ratios were most elevated within GM ROIs. A weak, positive but not significant association between dose, rCBV and rCBF ratio was demonstrated. Progressive rCBV and rCBF ratio increased with dose up to 10 Gy at 1 month. Conclusion(s): Normal tissue response following SRS can be characterized by dose, tissue, and time specific increases in rCBV and rCBF ratio. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2014.",Excluded
1681,"Multivariate analysis of factors affecting brainstem integral dose in stereotactic-treated patients. The dose contributed to the brainstem (B.S.) in stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) is an essential part of treatment plan evaluation. Yet, there is a lack of a stratifying schema for the lesions near the brain stem, based on doses and volume irradiated. We investigated the possible determining factors affecting brain stem integral dose (BSID). Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment plans of 141 patients treated by SRS or SRT were reviewed selection for this analysis was based upon lesions within 4 cm radius from the center of brain stem in all directions. Thirty-two patients were eligible. Out of 32 patients, 2 were treated with SRS and 6 with SRT. Lesions were stratified into five groups according to P-P distance (periphery of lesion to periphery of brain stem): group I (-1.5-0 cm) constituted lesions overlapping or interfacing brain stem; group II (0.1-0.9 cm); group III (1-1.9 cm); group IV (2-2.9 cm); group V (3-4 cm). Conformity index (PITV) volume of brain stem receiving the mean dose and BSID were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to correlate BSID with its determinants, namely PITV, P-P distance, C-P distance (center of lesion to periphery of brain stem), and mean collimator size. Result(s): The highest mean BSID was observed in group I and the least in group V; 1 patient in group I with BSID of 16.8 Gy/cc developed brain stem injury. In univariate analysis, all the determinant factors for BSID (P-P distance, C-P distance, collimator size, and PITV) were shown to impact its value, but on multivariate analysis only P-P distance was the significant factor (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Utilization of the P-P distance as a stratification method for lesions within 4 cm radius from the center of the brain stem is valuable in determining the brain stem integral dose. This schema may suggest that lesions in group I with P-P distance (-1.5-0.0 cm) are better treated with fractionated SRT rather than single-fraction SRS. In addition, plans requiring collimator size 730 mm with PITV > 1.5 should also be considered for fractionated regimens.",Excluded
1481,"Paraventricular hypothalamic influences on spinal nociceptive processing. Oxytocin properties have been studied in different experimental models in order to obtain evidence for its analgesic properties. The analgesic effect of an oxytocinergic pathway descending from the hypothalamus reaching the dorsal horn of the spinal cord has been studied. In anesthetized rats, we recorded single units at the L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn level and stimulated the peripheral receptive field. The evoked responses were classified according to their latencies in A-beta, A-delta, C fibers, and postdischarge. We used these responses to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus (PV) of the hypothalamus. We observed a selective blockage of A-delta and C fibers related to the duration of the train stimulus duration. Similar effects were observed when oxytocin (OT) was applied directly on the spinal cord. The effects of OT and of PV electrical stimulation were reversed in a dose-dependent manner by application of the specific OT antagonist (OTA). These effects were observed in cells with reduced wind-up and cells displaying a clear wind-up response to peripheral stimulation. Superficial and deeper cells in the dorsal spinal cord were involved. The recorded cells were marked by pontamine blue iontophoretic injection after each cell recording, and their histological locations were specified. In order to obtain a behavioral correlation, we used rats with a loose ligature of the sciatic nerve and a chronic intrathecal catheter reaching the L4-L5 spinal cord level. We tested the hyperalgesia and allodynia of these animals using von Frey filaments and the application of acetone to the hind paws. Our results show a significant reduction in the mechanical and thermal test after the administration of 15 microl of 10(-6) M OT. Our electrophysiological, pharmacological, and behavioral results point out a clear OT antialgesic effect. The results are discussed on the basis of a previous work showing an OT blockage of glutamate activation.

549,"Gold Nanorod-assisted Optical Stimulation of Neuronal Cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that nerves can be stimulated in a variety of ways by the transient heating associated with the absorption of infrared light by water in neuronal tissue. This technique holds great potential for replacing or complementing standard stimulation techniques, due to the potential for increased localization of the stimulus and minimization of mechanical contact with the tissue. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Moreover, thermal modelling suggests that cumulative heating effects might be potentially hazardous when multiple stimulus sites or high laser repetition rates are used. The protocol outlined below describes an enhanced approach to the infrared stimulation of neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism is based on the transient heating associated with the optical absorption of gold nanorods, which can cause triggering of neuronal cell differentiation and increased levels of intracellular calcium activity. These results demonstrate that nanoparticle absorbers can enhance and/or replace the process of infrared neural stimulation based on water absorption, with potential for future applications in neural prostheses and cell therapies.",Excluded

The first schedule did not interfere with the development of normally oriented and arborizing Purkinje cells. The second schedule led to the growth of twisted and entwined stem dendrites even when, in association, with the recovered granule cells, parallel fibers were present in the molecular layer together with Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. Evidence was presented that the alignment of Purkinje cell perikarya in a monolayer does not guarantee the normal growth of Purkinje cell stem dendrites which may be dependent on the presence of basket cells.

PURPOSE: After a spinal cord injury (SCI), which was complete, deafferentation of the body representation caudal to the lesion height results in drastic changes in the cortical representation. The underlaying processes are poorly understood.METHODS: We investigated cortical representation sites of upper limb muscles using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in five patients suffering from thoracic complete SCI and one with an incomplete SCI in the height of L1.RESULTS: In comparison to healthy controls fMRI demonstrated a displacement of elbow movement representations in the precentral gyrus in patients with complete SCI into the direction of the deafferented cortical thoracic representation. Changes increased with time after the incidence of SCI. TMS revealed reduced excitability and prolonged silent periods for muscles more distant to the deafferented area.CONCLUSIONS: Whereas fMRI demonstrated changes in representation sites adjacent to the deafferented area, TMS excitability changes were also observed more distant to the deafferented area and silent periods were prolonged in comparison to healthy controls. TMS changes might depend on both: the distance to the deafferented area and the time of persistence of deafferentation.",Excluded
1504,"[PET-CT for neuroendocrine tumors and nuclear medicine therapy options]. Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are defined by biochemical characteristics and structures which can be specifically addressed by radioligands for diagnostic imaging as well as radionuclide therapy in nuclear medicine. Somatostatin receptor imaging has been shown to be an important part of the diagnostic process in the management of NET for a long time. In recent years a number of tracers enabling PET-based imaging of somatostatin receptors and amine precursor uptake have been developed. By combining the specific functional information of the PET signal with anatomical information by CT imaging using PET-CT hybrid scanners, primary tumors and metastases can be detected with high resolution and high sensitivity. Compared with conventional indium-111 octreotide scintigraphy PET-CT has a higher resolution and also a lower radiation exposure. In addition, quantification of the tracer uptake allows therapy monitoring. By labelling with therapeutic beta-emitters, such as lutetium-177 or yttrium-90, a systemic internal radiotherapy with somotostatin analogues (peptide radionuclide radiation therapy, PRRT) can be provided as a therapeutic option for patients with unresectable and metastasized neuroendocrine tumors.

1671,"Radiosurgery for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas - Indications for limitations for gamma knife treatment. [Japanese]. We summarize the results of gamma knife treatment for dural arterivenous fistula (DAVF), are report our study. Since the early 1990s, DAVFs have been treated in the same manner as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), i.e., by radiosurgery, performed with or without embolization. DAVFs in the cavernous sinus, transverse-sigmoid sinus, and cerebellar tent were treated with a marginal dose of 18 to 20 Gy. The current obliteration rates of DAVF reported in literature are not low when compared with those of AVM. Excellent DAVF obliteration rates were observed in our study, which were similar to those reported in the literature. In fact, complete response (CR) was observed in 9 cases, partial response (PR) in 9 cases, and partical obliteration in 6 cases during the mean follow-up of 27 months. Moreover, considerable neurological improvements were noted, which apparently began at an early stage post radiosurgery. Bleeding was observed 2 cases associated with cortical reflux during the follow-up. In conclusion, radiosurgery for DAVF is very useful for both the obliteration of the fistula and for the improvement of clinical signs. However, prior to performing radiosurgery, the lesions with cortical reflux should be interrupted by initially treated with surgery or embolization.",Excluded
3596,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters. BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded
1702,"Intracavitary radioimmunotherapy to treat solid tumors. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) potentially is an attractive treatment for radiosensitive early-stage solid tumors and as an adjuvant to cytoreductive surgery. Topical administration of RIT may improve the efficacy because higher local concentrations are achieved. We reviewed the results of locally applied radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors. Intracavitary RIT in patients with ovarian cancer and glioma showed improved targeting after local administration, as compared to the intravenous administration. In addition, various studies showed the feasibility of locally applied RIT in these patients. In studies that included patients with small-volume disease, adjuvant RIT in ovarian cancer and glioma showed to be at least as effective as standard therapy. The information about RIT for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin is scarce, while results from preclinical data are promising. RIT may be applied for other, relatively unexplored indications. Studies on the application of radiolabeled antibodies in early urothelial cell cancer have been performed, showing that intracavitary RIT may hold a promise. Moreover, in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusion, RIT may play a role in the palliative treatment. Intracavitary RIT limits toxicity and improves tumor targeting. RIT is more effective in patients with small-volume disease of solid cancers. RIT may have potential for palliation in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusion. The future of RIT may, therefore, not only be in the inclusion in contemporary multimodality treatment, but also in the expansion to palliative treatment. Â© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2008.",Excluded
274,"ADC texture--an imaging biomarker for high-grade glioma?. PURPOSE: Survival for high-grade gliomas is poor, at least partly explained by intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to treatment resistance. Radiological evaluation of treatment response is in most cases limited to assessment of tumor size months after the initiation of therapy. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been widely investigated, as it reflects tumor cellularity and proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate texture analysis of ADC images in conjunction with multivariate image analysis as a means for identification of pretreatment imaging biomarkers.METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive high-grade glioma patients were treated with radiotherapy (2 Gy/60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. ADC maps and T1-weighted anatomical images with and without contrast enhancement were collected prior to treatment, and (residual) tumor contrast enhancement was delineated. A gray-level co-occurrence matrix analysis was performed on the ADC maps in a cuboid encapsulating the tumor in coronal, sagittal, and transversal planes, giving a total of 60 textural descriptors for each tumor. In addition, similar examinations and analyses were performed at day 1, week 2, and week 6 into treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality of the data, and the five largest components (scores) were used in subsequent analyses. MRI assessment three months after completion of radiochemotherapy was used for classifying tumor progression or regression.RESULTS: The score scatter plots revealed that the first, third, and fifth components of the pretreatment examinations exhibited a pattern that strongly correlated to survival. Two groups could be identified: one with a median survival after diagnosis of 1099 days and one with 345 days, p = 0.0001.CONCLUSIONS: By combining PCA and texture analysis, ADC texture characteristics were identified, which seems to hold pretreatment prognostic information, independent of known prognostic factors such as age, stage, and surgical procedure.

Purpose of the study: In order to investigate the role of radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of vestibular schwannomas, we have reviewed our own prospective cohort and the main series of the modern literature. Patients and Methods: Between July 14th 1992 and June 1st 2011, 2991 vestibular schwannomas were operated on the Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery Department of Timone University Hospital. All the patients have been evaluated prospectively, with a follow up longer than 3 years for 2336 patients, excluding patients suffering from type 2 neurofibromatosis (148 patients). In 7% of the patients, the vestibular schwannoma had previously been resected. According to Koos classification, in 17.6% of the patients, vestibular schwannomas were stage I, 51.8% stage II, 27% stage III and 3.6% stage IV. The mean tumour volume was 2.63 cm<sup>3</sup>. According to Garner Robertson classification, the hearing was still functional at the time of radiosurgery in 46% and subnormal in 20.9% of the patients. Result(s): Long term tumour control was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. A transient facial palsy was observed in 0.5% of the cases. The rate of trigeminal injury was 0.5%. Useful hearing was preserved at 3 years in 78%. This rate reached 95% in patients with no past history of sudden hearing loss. Other predictors of functional hearing preservation are the young age, the small size of the lesion and a dose to the modiulus of the cochlea lower than 4. Gy. We observed no radio-induced tumour. Only large, Koos IV vestibular schwannomas are contraindicated for upfront radiosurgery. In these patients, we propose a combined approach with a deliberately partial microsurgical removal, followed by a radiosurgery of the residue. Conclusion(s): This cohort is unique by the size of the population and the length of the follow up and results demonstrate the efficacy of radiosurgery and its safety, especially its high rate of hearing preservation.

1034,"Fractional anisotropy dose-response relationship of the corpus callosum. Purpose or Objective: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive modality for determination of water diffusion properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA) quantifies the extent of directionality of water diffusion. We investigated absorbed dose as a predictor of FA change in the corpus callosum (CC) following radiation therapy for high grade glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with high-grade glioma underwent DTI scans before, and ten months after radiation therapy to 59.4-60 Gy. Diffusion data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Using an automated white matter fiber tracking technique, 23 fiber tracts were segmented on the baseline and follow-up DTI images. The CT images used for treatment planning and both DTI image sets were aligned using non-linear registration. This way, the baseline FA, the follow-up FA, and the absorbed dose could be determined for each voxel in all 15 patients. For each voxel in the CC, we calculated the FA change as FA follow-up /FA baseline and dichotomized the data into a binary outcome variable using 0.5 as cutoff. For all 15 patients, logistic regression was used to determine dose-response curve parameters (D50 and g50) and their confidence intervals (CIs). We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminative ability of the voxel dose. Then, we estimated dose-response curve parameters and calculated the AUC for each patient individually. Result(s): The median age was 59 (range: 40-85) years. The average CC volume and average CC mean absorbed dose was 62+/-8 cm3 and 26+/-14 Gy (1 SD), respectively. Using data from 99 691 voxels, the estimated parameters for the doseresponse curve for all patients (upper panel in Figure 1) were D50=88.0+/-0.1 Gy and gamma50=0.80+/-0.01 (95% CIs). The AUC was 0.71 indicating good discriminative ability. For nine out of 15 patients, the individual AUC was >=0.60, indicating that higher absorbed dose is associated with higher probability of FA change >=0.5. Dose -response curves for those patients are shown in the lower panel in Figure 1 and their estimated parameter values in Table 1. Individual D50s varied between 41.3 and 125.9 Gy. Conclusion(s): Absorbed dose was a significant predictor of FA change in the CC. This was the case both when all patients were pooled for analysis, and in nine out of 15 patients when analyzed separately. More detailed analyses are needed to better understand the effect radiation has on water diffusion in brain white matter. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
953,"Tolerances on MLC leaf position accuracy for IMRT delivery with a dynamic MLC. The objective determination of performance standards for radiation therapy equipment requires, ideally, establishing the quantitative relationship between performance deviations and clinical outcome or some acceptable surrogate. In this simulation study the authors analyzed the dosimetric impact of random (leaf by leaf) and systematic (entire leaf bank) errors in the position of the MLC leaves on seven clinical prostate and seven clinical head and neck IMRT plans delivered using a dynamic MLC. In-house software was developed to incorporate normally distributed errors of up to +/- 2 mm in individual leaf position or systematic errors (+/- 1 and +/- 0.5 mm in all leaves of both leaf banks or +1 mm in one bank only) into the 14 plans, thus simulating treatment delivery using a suboptimally performing MLC. The dosimetric consequences of suboptimal MLC performance were quantified using the equivalent uniform doses (EUDs) of the clinical target volumes and important organs at risk (OARs). The deviation of the EUDs of the selected structures as the performance of the MLC deteriorated was used as the objective surrogate of clinical outcome. Random errors of 2 mm resulted in negligible changes for all structures of interest in both sites. In contrast, systematic errors can lead to potentially significant dosimetric changes that may compromise clinical outcome. If a 2% change in EUD of the target and 2 Gy for the OARs were adopted as acceptable levels of deviation in dose due to MLC effects alone, then systematic errors in leaf position will need to be limited to 0.3 mm. This study provides guidance, based on a dosimetric surrogate of clinical outcome, for the development of one component, leaf position accuracy of performance standards for multileaf collimators.",Excluded

A level of tool penetration force during cutting of bones has been the prime concern to surgeons, since it can produce unnecessary mechanical damage to surrounding tissues. Research in this area has been undertaken for many decades to find ways to minimise the cutting force. Cutting of bone with ultrasonic tools is a relatively new technique replacing conventional procedures in neuro-, dental and orthopaedic surgeries, due to its precision and safety. In this article, the level of forces produced during a chisel-like tool penetration in a fresh cortical bone is studied. The obtained force data are analysed for both conventional cutting and ultrasonically assisted cutting. Through a series of experiments, it was demonstrated that the depth of cut and parameters of ultrasonic oscillations affected the level of cutting force, the former being the main factor in both types of cutting. It was found that the tool penetration force was decreased with an increase in the ultrasonic frequency or amplitude and was not affected by the cutting speed. The rise in bone temperature was measured and was found to be insensitive to the level of cutting speed within the range used in this study.",Excluded
1762,"Prescription ISO-energy is a strong predictor of symptomatic adverse radiation effect in stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastases. Purpose/Objective(s): In this study, we aim to 1) determine whether a new parameter named prescription iso-energy (PIE) correlates with the development of symptomatic adverse radiation effect (ARE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases and 2) compare PIE with known dosimetric prognostic parameters for ARE such as the 10 and 12-Gy isodose volume. Materials/Methods: The PIE is simply defined as the product of the prescription dose in Gy (joule/kg, equivalent to mJ/mL of tissue) and the prescription isodose volume in mL. The senior radiation oncologist of the study (PKS) had previously reviewed and scored outcome (no failure/ no ARE, failure, asymptomatic vs symptomatic ARE, and indeterminate cases of lesion enlargement) after SRS at our institution from 1998-2009 for 2,200 brain metastases with at least 3 months of imaging follow-up. For this analysis, we considered the 1,640 metastases treated with SRS alone, or SRS after previous whole-brain radiation therapy, for which there was no coalescence of 50% of prescription dose-volume with that of any nearby metastasis. A logistic regression model was then developed to correlate the incidence of symptomatic ARE with a series of parameters that included PIE and peripheral isodose volumes such as 8-Gy to 12-Gy isodose volume, scoring symptomatic ARE as 2, indeterminate cases as 1, and remaining outcomes as 0 (no failure and no ARE, failure, or asymptomatic ARE). Result(s): There were 50 cases of symptomatic ARE in this subset. Marginal levels of significance were achieved when correlating the incidence of symptomatic ARE with peripheral isodose volumes. For example, using 12-Gy isodose volume, the logistically regressed slope was 0.828 +/- 0.429 (P =.082) with a 95% confidence interval of -0.127-1.782, in which the zero slope value cannot be directly rejected from the model. In contrast, PIE (in the units of mJ or Gy-mL) was found to be highly significant in correlating with the incidence of symptomatic ARE, yielding a positive slope value of 1.264 +/- 0.275 (P =.0003) with a 95% confidence interval of 0.681-1.848. The adjusted R2 and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were also significantly improved for PIE versus 12-Gy isodose volume (R2 = 0.88 vs 0.77 and jBICj = 33 vs 21, respectively). Based on the PIE results, functional curves were derived that enable a user to evaluate risk of symptomatic ARE when prescribing a dose to various target volumes. Conclusion(s): Analysis of >1,500 brain metastases treated with SRS has demonstrated that PIE is strongly predicative of developing symptomatic ARE, correlating more strongly with risk of ARE than 10 or 12-Gy volume.",Excluded

Median marginal prescription dose was 20 Gy. The local tumor control rates were 96.4% at 6 months and 89.9% at 1 year. There was no statistically significant difference between ovarian and uterine cancers. Higher prescription dose and smaller tumor volume were significantly correlated with local tumor control. Median overall survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and solitary brain metastasis were significantly correlated with satisfactory overall survival. Median activities of daily living (ADL) preservation survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and higher Karnofsky Performance Status score were significantly correlated with better ADL preservation.

1417,"Neuroimaging and quality-of-life outcomes in patients with brain metastasis and peritumoral edema who undergo Gamma Knife surgery. OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been shown to be effective for treating many patients with brain metastasis. Some brain metastases demonstrate significant peritumoral edema; radiation may induce cerebral edema or worsening preexisting edema. This study was conducted to evaluate the imaging and neurobehavioral outcomes in patients with preexisting peritumoral edema who then undergo GKS.METHODS: Between August 2003 and January 2008, 63 cases of brain metastasis with significant peritumoral edema (> 20 cm(3)) were prospectively studied. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a single metastatic lesion with significant edema (perilesional edema signal volume on FLAIR > 20 cm(3)); and 2) inclusion of only 1 lesion > 20 cm(3) in the study (in cases of multiple lesions noted on FLAIR images). All patients received MR imaging with pulse sequences including T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR with or without contrast and T2-weighted imaging at an interval of 3 months. A neurological assessment and Brain Cancer Module (BCM-20) questionnaire were obtained every 2-3 months. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival.",Excluded
3586,"Oxidative modulation of the transient potassium current IA by intracellular arachidonic acid in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons. Oxidative stress affects cellular membrane lipids and proteins. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording we demonstrate differential oxidative inhibition of voltage-gated transient (IA) and delayed rectifier [IK(V)] K+ currents by arachidonic acid (AA) and H2O2 in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slice. We show that intracellular application of 1 pm AA or its non-metabolizable analog eicosatetraynoic acid (100 pm) reduced IA by approximately 42% but did not affect IK(V). AA shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of IA by 12 mV to more negative potentials whereas the rate of inactivation was unchanged. Surprisingly, intracellular glutathione (GSH, 20 mm) enhanced the effect of AA on maximal IA (-62%) and with AA slowed inactivation of IA. The combination of GSH and extracellular ascorbate (0.4 mm) prevented reduction of IA by AA. Intracellular Trolox (a vitamin E analog, 10 microm) reduced IA by 61%and IK(V) by 39%. Like AA, intracellular Trolox caused a 10-mV left shift of IA steady-state inactivation but Trolox and AA did not cause a shift when coapplied. Extracellular Trolox (100 microm) had no effects on IA. H2O2 (80 microm) reduced both IA and IK(V) in a GSH- and ascorbate-sensitive manner and slowed the rate of inactivation of IA by a factor of 2. Coapplication of H2O2 with GSH and extracellular ascorbate caused approximately 22 mV negative shifts of both steady-state inactivation and activation. We conclude that AA is extremely potent in affecting IA by oxidative modifications. Antioxidants can augment these effects, probably by catalysis of the underlying reactions between oxidants and IA channel proteins.",Excluded
1190,"Synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held under in vivo like activity levels. One of the hallmarks of auditory neurons in vivo is spontaneous activity that occurs even in the absence of any sensory stimuli. Sound-evoked bursts of discharges are thus embedded within this background of random firing. The calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) has been characterized in vitro as a fast relay that reliably fires at high stimulus frequencies (< or =800 Hz). However, inherently due to the preparation method, spontaneous activity is absent in studies using brain stem slices. Here we first determine in vivo spontaneous firing rates of MNTB principal cells from Mongolian gerbils and then reintroduce this random firing to in vitro gerbil brain stem synapses at near-physiological temperature. After conditioning synapses with afferent fiber stimulation for 2 min at Poisson averaged rates of 20, 40, and 60 Hz, we observed a number of differences in the properties of synaptic transmission between conditioned and unconditioned synapses. Foremost, we observed reduced steady-state EPSC amplitudes that depressed even further during an embedded short-stimulation train of 100, 300, or 600 Hz (a protocol that thus simulates in vitro what probably occurs at the in vivo MNTB after a short sound stimulus in a silent background). Accordingly, current-clamp, dynamic-clamp, and loose-patch recordings revealed a number of action potential failures at the postsynaptic cell during high-frequency-stimulation trains, although the initial onset of evoked activity was still transmitted with higher fidelity. We thus propose that some in vivo auditory synapses are in a tonic state of reduced EPSC amplitudes as a consequence of high spontaneous spiking and this in vivo-like conditioning has important consequences for the encoding of signals throughout the auditory pathway.",Excluded
847,"Rapid activation of presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by nerve-released transmitter. Nicotine's ability to enhance neurotransmitter release has implicated presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in synaptic modulation, but there aze few examples where presynaptic nAChRs are known to be activated by nerve-released transmitter. We searched for endogenous activation of presynaptic nAChRs in the calyceal nerve terminals of the chick ciliary ganglion by imaging presynaptic calcium transients using dextran-coupled indicator dyes. The amplitude of Ca(+)signals recorded in individual nerve terminals was frequency dependent over 2-50 Hz. Calcium transients evoked by stimulation of the preganglionic nerve were significantly reduced (approximately 10-15%) by the nonspecific nAChR antagonist d-tubocurarine (d-TC; 100 microM) and the alpha7-specific antagonist methyllycaconitine (20-50 nM) but were not affected by 10 microM dihydro-beta-erythroidine, which should inhibit several non-alpha7 nAChRs. Feedback was rapid and did not require a stimulation-dependent build-up of transmitter, as d-TC and MLA reduced the amplitude of the first calcium transient in a 2-Hz train. Choline is an agonist at alpha7 nAChRs but is not the sole agonist in this system, as inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate failed to reduce calcium transients. These results show that nerve-released acetylcholine (ACh) feeds back onto presynaptic alpha7 nAChRs to enhance calcium signals within the terminal. This feedback may help maintain the high rate of transmission at this cholinergic synapse.",Excluded

This observation is similar to that following ionizing radiation; however, the effect is slower following the chemical treatment. Recovery of the normal cells occurs 15-18 hours after treatment, whereas the ataxia telangiectasia lines do not attain normal levels of DNA synthesis during the entire 24-hour observation period. Similar differences were not observed following treatment with mitomycin C, a bifunctional alkylating agent, indicating a specific effect of bleomycin on DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia cells.

3493,"Dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide in rat striatal slices. The present study explored the mechanisms underlying the dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide, a compound commonly used as a 5-HT3 receptor agonist. Phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, enhanced the outflow of radioactivity from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [3H]dopamine. The presence of the dopamine uptake blocker nomifensin prevented the increase in outflow. The effect of phenylbiguanide was not antagonized by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, did not require the presence of Ca2+ in the superfusion buffer, and also occurred in reserpinized preparations with depleted dopamine stores. Phenylbiguanide caused a greater shift in the distribution of superfusate radioactivity from DOPAC to dopamine than did nomifensin. All these results are in agreement with an exchange mechanism by which phenylbiguanide promotes the efflux of dopamine by operation of the uptake carrier in the reversed direction. In consonance, phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, inhibited the binding of [3H]CFT to dopamine uptake sites, although the rank order for promoting outflow, serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide greater than 2-methyl-serotonin, differed from that for inhibiting [3H]CFT binding to dopamine uptake sites, 2-methylserotonin approximately serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide. The present results raised the possibility that phenylbiguanide has an additional activity in releasing vesicular dopamine into the cytoplasmic pool.",Excluded
2959,"Quantitative characterization of nuclear overhauser enhancement and amide proton transfer effects in the human brain at 7 tesla. PURPOSE: This study aimed to quantitatively investigate two main magnetization transfer effects at low B1: the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) and amide proton transfer in the human brain at 7 T.METHODS: The magnetization transfer effects in the human brain were characterized using a four-pool proton model, which consisted of bulk water, macromolecules, an amide group of mobile proteins and peptides, and NOE-related protons resonating upfield. The pool sizes, exchange rates, and relaxation times of these proton pools were investigated quantitatively by fitting, and the net signals of amide proton transfer and NOE were simulated based on the fitted parameters.RESULTS: The results showed that the four-pool model fitted the experimental data quite well, and the NOE effects in human brain at 7 T had a broad spectrum distribution. The NOE effects peaked at a B1 of ~ 1-1.4 muT and were significantly stronger in the white matter than in the gray matter, corresponding to a pool-size ratio ~ 2:1. As the amide proton transfer effect was relatively small compared with the NOE effects, magnetization transfer asymmetry analysis yielded an NOE-dominated contrast in the healthy human brain in this range of B1.CONCLUSION: These findings are important to identify the source of NOE effects and to quantify amide proton transfer effects in human brain at 7 T.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective: To evaluate a commercial plastic scintillation detector (PSD) versus a commercial diamond detector (DD) for the dosimetric pre-treatment quality assurance (QA) of stereotactic radiosurgery cranial treatments delivered with Dynamic Conformal Arcs (DCA). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 15 patients plans and 79 DCA generated in iPlan (BrainLAB, AG, Germany) with a mean equivalent MLC field size of 16.6 mm (range 7.5-32.7mm) were tested. Plans were delivered on a Novalis TX, using the 6XSRS energy mode with a D/R of 1000 MU/min and a HDMLC multileaf collimator (2.5 mm leaf size at isocenter). Using a Lucy 3D QA Phantom (Standard Imaging, Inc., USA), dose distributions were recalculated for each plan and the absolute isocenter dose was checked for each treatment field in the phantom, both with a DD (PTW 60003 Diamond Detector PTW, Freiburg, Germany) and with a PSD (Exradin W1 scintillator, Standard Imaging, Inc., USA). The detectors were positioned in the same way in the phantom, each with its specific insert, both with their longitudinal axis parallel the radiation beam when the gantry is at zero angle (see figure). This position was used to acquire the CT images of the phantom, define the isocenter location and the setup measurements. The figure shows also that the DD creates artifacts in the CT scan caused by the metallic connectors of the detector which lead to dose under-dosage estimation for table position 0degree (the artifact represents a region of density higher than the acrylic material of the phantom which at table position zero falls on the beam path with a consequent larger than real radiation absorption and therefore lowers the dose calculated at isocenter). This effect is not present for the PSD. The DD, because of its small detector volume, is being used as our gold standard for fixed dose rates treatments. Furthermore our DD presents a well centered sensitive detector volume, as measured on X-ray images, of about 0.002 cc against 0.0024 cc of the PSD. Result(s): The mean dose ratio (measured/expected) over all arcs for the DD and PSD was 1.020 (SD 0.035) and 1.020 (SD 0.025) respectively. Excluding DCA with table rotations at 0degree (5 arcs) the mean dose ratio was 1.014 (SD 0.022) and 1.021 (SD 0.026) respectively for the DD and PSD. The mean ratio PSD/DD of the dose readings distribution over all arcs and excluding zero table positions was 1.001 (SD 0.026) and 1.006 (SD 0.014) respectively. Conclusion(s): The Exradin W1 Scintillator seems to be suitable for pretreatment QA of typical clinical MLC based stereotactic radio surgery plans, with equivalent MLC field sizes starting from 7.5 mm. Furthermore, the Exradin W1 Scintillator because of its water equivalence does not cause any dose perturbations. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
3016,"Effects of exposure of the ear to GSM microwaves: in vivo and in vitro experimental studies. The effects of mobile phone (GSM) microwaves on the ears of guinea pigs were investigated in two in vivo experiments and one in vitro experiment. In the first experiment, three groups of eight guinea pigs had their left ear exposed for 1 h/day, 5 days/week, for 2 months, to GSM microwaves (900 MHz. GSM modulated) at specific absorption rates (SARs) of 1, 2 and 4 W/kg respectively, and a fourth group was sham-exposed. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured for each ear before exposure, at the end of the 2-month exposure period, and 2 months later. In the second experiment, the same protocol was applied to eight sham-exposed and 16 exposed guinea pigs at 4W/kg, but the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were monitored. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed no difference in DPOAE amplitudes or in ABR thresholds between the exposed and non-exposed ears and between the sham-exposed and exposed groups In the course of the second experiment, acute effects were also investigated by measuring once, in all animals, ABR thresholds just before and just after the 1-h exposure: no statistically significant difference was observed. In vitro, the two organs of Corti (OCs) of newborn rats (n=15) were isolated and placed in culture. For each animal, one OC was exposed for 24-48 h to 1 W/kg GSM microwaves, and the other was sham-exposed. After 2-3 days of culture, all OCs were observed under light microscopy. They all appeared normal to naive observers at this stage of development.

207,"Neuronal activity in vivo enhances functional myelin repair. In demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), demyelination of neuronal fibers impairs impulse conduction and causes axon degeneration. While neuronal activity stimulates oligodendrocyte production and myelination in normal conditions, it remains unclear whether the activity of demyelinated axons restores their loss-of-function in a harmful environment. To investigate this question, we established a model to induce a moderate optogenetic stimulation of demyelinated axons in the corpus callosum at the level of the motor cortex in which cortical circuit activation and locomotor effects were reduced in adult freely moving mice. We demonstrate that a moderate activation of demyelinated axons enhances the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells onto mature oligodendrocytes, but only under a repeated stimulation paradigm. This activity-dependent increase in the oligodendrocyte pool promotes an extensive remyelination and functional restoration of conduction, as revealed by ultrastructural analyses and compound action potential recordings. Our findings reveal the need of preserving an appropriate neuronal activity in the damaged tissue to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination, likely by enhancing axon-oligodendroglia interactions. Our results provide new perspectives for translational research using neuromodulation in demyelinating diseases.",Excluded

2594,"Octopamine modulates photoreceptor function in the Limulus lateral eye. Activity at night in efferent nerve fibers from a central circadian clock produces changes in photoreceptor function in the lateral compound eye of Limulus: the response to light is increased; membrane potential fluctuations (bumps) occurring in the dark are suppressed; and the duration of bumps occurring both in the dark and under dim illumination is increased (Barlow et al., 1977; Kaplan & Barlow, 1980; Barlow, 1983; Barlow et al., 1985). Efferent nerve terminals release octopamine when activated (Battelle et al., 1982; Battelle & Evans, 1984, 1986); exogenous octopamine in vitro produces some of the changes resulting from efferent nerve activity in vivo (Kass et al., 1988). We report here that the increase in both on-transient and steady-state response to light induced by octopamine in the lateral eye in vitro are concentration dependent with threshold at or below 100 nM, saturation at or above 100 microM, and half-maximal increase in the range 1-10 microM. Octopamine also reduces bump activity in the dark in a concentration-dependent way. Unlike the increase in light response, the dependence of this effect on octopamine concentration is extremely variable from specimen to specimen. The effects of exogenous octopamine on light response and bump activity can sometimes be reversed by removing octopamine from the medium bathing the in vitro preparation. Octopamine also increases bump duration, apparently in a concentration-dependent manner. We have not succeeded in reversing this increase in bump duration. The concentration dependence of changes in photoreceptor response described here agrees qualitatively with the dependence of cAMP levels on octopamine in Limulus photoreceptors (Kaupp et al., 1982), lending further support to the idea that cAMP acts as a second messenger in the circadian control of photoreceptor function. Our results also suggest that the changes induced in the transient and steady-state response to light by both efferent nerve activity and exogenous octopamine have a common origin, which may differ from that responsible for the modulation of bump activity.",Excluded

967,"Other dementias. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of degenerative dementia in elderly people after Alzheimer's disease (AD), with approximately 10-15% of dementia cases at autopsy demonstrating the presence of Lewy body pathology [1]. In Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia is a common outcome in up to 80% of patients with PD who will eventually develop dementia as their disease progresses [2, 3]. DLB and PD can be grouped under the umbrella term of Lewy body disease (LBD) due to the overlap in symptom profile, similar response to treatment and the common underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation neuropathology [4]. Together DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) represent an important disease group in older age, with significant health and social impacts. LBD patients display marked deficits in executive and visuo-spatial/visuo-perceptual function, as well as marked variations in their level of arousal and attention which are known as cognitive fluctuations [5-8]. LBD clinical features also include spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism [6], and nonmotor manifestations including symptoms such as visual hallucinations, autonomic dysfunction, syncope, repeated falls, REM sleep behaviour disorder, delusions and depression [6]. However, there are a number of important diagnostic challenges. For example, the differentiation of DLB from Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be difficult, particularly in the early stages of disease when core DLB symptoms may be less evident [9]. Similarly, discrimination between PD, PD or DLB with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, MCI-DLB) and PDD can be problematic as the development of cognitive impairment is often insidious and appears at a variable time after PD diagnosis [10]. There are also a number of treatment challenges. Profound cholinergic deficits occur in the LBDs, even more than in AD [11]. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors may have cognitive and neuropsychiatric benefits including improvements in global cognitive function, attentional function and activities of daily living [12]. However, there are frequently variations in treatment response [13]. The development of novel therapeutics is required, but this process has been hampered by the lack of LBD biomarkers which are sensitive to treatment response. In summary, therefore, there is a clear need to develop LBD biomarkers in order to facilitate early and differential diagnosis (during the prodromal phase of disease); improve our understanding of disease progression; provide a means to monitor therapeutic response; pave the way for early disease-modifying interventions. Existing biomarkers include a range of clinical, biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and, in particular, neuroimaging biomarkers [17, 18]. Generally the utility of these biomarkers has only been supported in a research context aside from dopamine transporter imaging, which due to its high specificity in differentiating LBD from AD [19] is now considered the gold standard for in vivo differential diagnosis between LBD and AD. However FP-CIT remains expensive, has a radioactive exposure and provides little or no information on the disease progression, prognosis, or correlation with cognitive/behavioural symptom severity. Biomarkers should ideally be inexpensive, non-invasive, simple to use and technically validated [20]. In this regard, neurophysiological measures, and in particular electroencephalography (EEG), are currently undergoing a renaissance as potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease.",Excluded
2284,"[Radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of vestibular schwannoma]. Management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) should always be interdisciplinary and results better than the natural course. Particularly in small VS, either microsurgical resection or radiosurgery (RS) can be employed. RS is a special method (initially only possible stereotactically) for delivering high-precision radiation from many directions to the target point (the isocenter) in a single high dose. With the development of three different systems-Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), special linear accelerators, and CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)-the options were extended to 1-5 fractions for RS and multisession RS (msRS), and to up to 6 weeks of conventional fractionation as stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Whereas RS uses high ablative single doses, SRT is based on the well-known radiobiological effects of multiple fractions comprising lower single doses up to a required much higher total dose. Evaluation showed that RS and SRT achieve similarly high rates of tumor control of around 90% and low rates of side effects (1-7%). Therefore, SRT is unnecessary for small but clearly progressing VS, which has made RS a very comfortable, effective treatment option. In addition to SRT, larger VS can be treated comparably effectively with CyberKnife-based msRS. Since modern MRI frequently discovers small VS as ""incidental findings"", the initial biding strategy (wait and scan) is of particular importance. Only with increasing symptoms and detectable tumor growth is the treatment indication established, at which time the decision for surgery and RS/SRT should be taken interdisciplinary under consideration of the patient's wishes.",Excluded

The importance of POU proteins as developmental regulators and tumor-promoting agents is due to linker flexibility, which allows them to adapt to a considerable variety of DNA targets. However, because of this flexibility, it has not been possible to determine the Oct-1/Pit-1 linker structure in crystallographic POU/DNA complexes. We have previously shown that the neuronal POU protein N-Oct-3 linker contains a structured region. Here, we have used a combination of hydrodynamic methods, DNA footprinting experiments, molecular modeling and small angle X-ray scattering to (i) structurally interpret the N-Oct-3-binding site within the HLA DRalpha gene promoter and deduce from this a novel POU domain allosteric conformation and (ii) analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in conformational transitions. We conclude that there might exist a continuum running from free to 'pre-bound' N-Oct-3 POU conformations and that regulatory DNA regions likely select pre-existing conformers, in addition to molding the appropriate DBD structure. Finally, we suggest that a specific pair of glycine residues in the linker might act as a major conformational switch. Â© 2007 The Author(s).",Excluded

1321,"Principles of radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis. Neoplastic meningosis can be a complication of a tumor originating in the brain or the meninges, or it can be a complication of a solid tumor elsewhere that has metastasized to the leptomeninges. The therapeutic dilemma for a radiation oncologist is that neoplastic meningosis involves the entire neuraxis and, as a consequence, ideally, the entire neuraxis should be radiated. However, delivering the necessary radiation dose to the entire neuraxis may be associated with considerable neurologic or bone marrow toxicity. Radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis can be performed by external beam radiation or by intrathecal injection of radioactive nuclides or radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Intrathecal radiation has the theoretical advantage that treatment is directed towards the entire neuraxis with limited irradiation outside the neuraxis. In practice, intrathecal radiation is still under investigation and subject to some limitations and toxicities. Indications and techniques for external beam radiation may range from either therapeutic or elective cranial or craniospinal radiation to palliative involved-field radiation. Patients with neoplastic meningosis are frequently treated with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy, and/or may have been irradiated to the nervous system in the past. Both are well known risk factors for radiation damage to the nervous system. In general, current treatment protocols focus on the development of combination chemotherapy programs and reduction of the radiation dose to minimize toxicity and/or to improve tumor control.",Excluded
2115,Effects of prenatal ionizing irradiation on the development of the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina. Prenatal exposure to ionizing irradiation has been shown to be an effective method to eliminate selectively certain neuronal population. This investigation studied the effects on the ganglion cell layer of the retinae of adult mice exposed to a gamma source (total dose = 3 Gy) at 16 days gestation. There was a significant reduction in the total number of neurons (displaced amacrine + ganglion cells) in the ganglion cell layer (33%) that was mainly caused by a pronounced loss (59%) of displaced amacrine cells. The diameters of the surviving retinal ganglion cells were consistently larger than those of the controls. Prenatal irradiation is the first experimental approach that partially eliminates displaced amacrine cells. It is suggested that the morphogenesis of retinal ganglion cells may be affected by displaced amacrine cells. Â© 2001 ISDN.,Excluded
2730,"Results of a randomized, global, multi-center study of whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) plus veliparib or placebo in patients (pts) with brain metastases (BM) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Background: Veliparib (V) is a potent, orally bioavailable PARP inhibitor that crosses the blood brain barrier. Phase 2 trials in BRCA pts as monotherapy or in unselected pts in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy have demonstrated evidence of efficacy. V plus radiation has shown promising efficacy in preclinical models and clinically in combination with WBRT. Method(s): Pts were randomized 1:1:1 to WBRT plus V 50 mg BID (V50), V 200 mg BID (V200), or P BID. Treatment began within 28 days (d) of diagnosis. Pts received 30 Gray WBRT in 10 fractions. V50, V200, or P BID was self-administered starting on d 1 of WBRT and continuing until 1 d after completion. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Survival was assessed at 2 month (m) intervals for 6 m then every 3 m (>=36 m). Pts who received >=1 dose were included in the safety analyses; AEs were compared across arms using Fisher's exact test. Result(s): 307 pts were randomized. OS, intracranial response rate, and time to clinical or radiographic progression were not statistically significantly different between any of the V arms and the P arm. There were no differences in all grade adverse drug reactions (ADRs) across arms and a modest improvement in grade 3/4 AEs in the V arms. Conclusion(s): Although preclinical and early clinical data suggested that V might synergize with radiotherapy, there was no difference in multiple study endpoints between V50 or V200 and P in this setting. Safety parameters observed in the V arms were generally similar to the P arm; no new safety signals of V were identified. (Table Presented).",Excluded

Chemotherapy is able to convert macroscopic to microscopic disease permitting a dose reduction to the tumor site and possibly the ventricular system and is investigated in prospective trials. Chemotherapy alone cannot replace radiotherapy as sole treatment. Whole-ventricular radiotherapy followed by a boost to tumor site without chemotherapy might be feasible.

631,"Measurement of cerebral ventricular sizes and parenchymal abnormalities on bedside by ultrasound sonography in patients with craniectomy: Comparison with CCT. Introduction: In patients with craniectomy ventricular size and parenchymal abnormalities are reliably estimated by CCT or MRI. Both techniques are time consuming; CCT involves frequent radiation exposure. Measurement of ventricular sizes or parenchymal abnormalities by ultrasound sonography is rarely performed. Aim of the study: To compare data of measurements of the ventricular size and anatomic structures by ultrasound sonography and CCT in patients (n = 62) with craniectomy following traumatic or vascular accidents. Method(s): Transcranial Duplex sonography (Hitachi-EUB 5000+C; 5-2/Abdominal probe; 1.4 MHz) over the craniectomized hemisphere. Documentation of land marks such as alteration of parenchymal structure, extravascular blood accumulation, hygroma, ventricular diameter, midline shift. Data of ventricular diameter were correlated with measurements obtained by CCT. Result(s): Sonography of the brain's structures and vessels by ultrasound sonography provide sharp outlined pictures which can be compared to CCT imaging with high reliability. Aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter were identified in some cases. The correlation of the diameter of the ventricles of the craniectomized and the contralateral side between ultrasound measurement and CCT was high (correlation coeffizient 0.826 for the first and 0.959 for subsequent measurements). In repetitive studies of the ultrasound measurements over a few days (without repetitive CCT), the stability of the diameter was high. Alteration of the horizontal body position between zero and 45 degrees did not affect the diameter of the ventricles. Midline shifts were detected with high reliability. Quantitative measurement of the blood flow velocity in the large intracerebral vessels using the Doppler modus was possible. Summary: B-mode ultrasound measurements of the ventricular size, the parenchyma and of the blood flow velocity in patients with craniectomy deliver reliable quantitative results for clinical neurosurgical and neurological decisions and may economize indication for frequent CCT.",Excluded
2198,"How different is the cancer patient in the management of spinal analgesia? Update in decision algorithm regarding device selection. Intrathecal drug delivery (ITDD or IDD) represents a technique able to provide satisfactory analgesia by continuous infusion of drugs into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The technique is based on the concept that the drug, by direct delivery into the CSF within the intrathecal space, avoids crossing the blood-brain barrier and therefore it is possible to use a dosage lower than oral, intravenous, transdermal or epidural administration. A further advantage of administering the drug directly into the CSF involves the possibility of using small doses capable of binding to the specific receptors, with a consequent reduction in systemic side effects and a more rapid and effective response. There are many receptors at the level of the spinal cord that can be used for the management of pain: opioid receptors (mu, kappa and delta), GABA, alpha-2, dopaminergic and NMDA receptors, as well as sodium and calcium channels. In patients suffering from chronic cancer or noncancer pain and who complain of intolerable side effects as a result of their current therapeutic options, intrathecal analgesia has become a technique of choice whereas all other treatment options have been exhausted. Some studies have suggested that ITDD is effective in providing pain relief in 60-80% of patients with chronic malignant pain(1, 2). Pain is often regarded as the most feared symptom among cancer patients and can appear at any time during the course of the disease. Very frequently pain is also the first sign of cancer; pain is also associated with cancer treatment, and may present itself as acute or chronic. In addition, the worsening of the disease can result in pain worsening. It is common opinion that, before implanting a patient with an intrathecal pump, it could be useful a trial test as it could simulate the system which is then implanted. Recently, the group of experts of Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference 2012 (3) considered the trial questionable in the case of patients with cancer pain. In fact they believe that a trial (single-shot or continuous infusion for 72-96 hours) can hardly predict an Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia or pain modification in the event of cancer disease progression. There are numerous options for intrathecal administration ranging from tunneled external catheter connected to an external pump to a fully implanted system. The choice of device depends on several factors, including life expectancy, the cost, the availability of professional skills, the patient's wishes and the level of comfort. The percutaneous approach is favored because the catheter is easily positioned with the aid of fluoroscopy and is suitable for patients with limited life expectancy. Nonetheless, it is generally considered to be only a temporary option due to limitations such as a possible infection or catheter migration. Fully implanted drug delivery systems (intrathecal pumps) are suitable for long term use. Patient's daily life is not particularly limited by these systems. Patients will obviously need for subsequent assessments provided by a specialist multi-professional infrastructure that allows adequate follow-up and pump refill. The pump may consist of a non programmable and programmable device with the possibility to modify the administration rate via a wireless remote control. Obviously nonprogrammable (continuous rate) pumps are less expensive than programmable ones but lack of flexibility in the ability to vary the flow of the drug according to the needs of the patient. When deciding the type of pump to be implanted, we must assess the patient's needs and the adequacy of the system with respect to drugs administered. Programmable devices such as Medtronic SynchroMed II or Codman MEDSTREAM are able to administer a specific amount of drug in a variable manner; the dosage of drugs can be modified in a non invasive manner using the programmer. Moreover the technology developed by Medtronic,the so-called Patient Therapy Manager , proved to be of crucial importance, allowing to treat break through pain by programmable intrathecal bolus, offerin to patients a decisive better pain treatment . In case of a suspected or actual malfunction, the programmable pump can be interrogated and / or switched off without the need to empty it. However, the battery that drives these systems generally has a duration of 5-8 years, so requiring a revision surgery to substitute it. Although the cost of treatment is an important consideration for any therapeutic area, the quality of life of cancer patients is important, and no patient should suffer when there is availability of effective treatments. In reality, the pain is associated with considerable social and economic costs worldwide. The lack of treatment or an unsuccessful treatment of pain is associated with a poor quality of life. Although the costs incurred at the time of pump implantation are significant, the long-term administration of opioids for intrathecal route is less expensive than treatment with oral opioid. The cost analysis showed that intrathecal administration is the most convenient way of opioids administration for patients who require long-term management of cancer pain (>= 3-6 months).In cancer patients the placement of the pump should be planned to avoid in the future its exposure to any radiotherapeutic treatment. If a pump, especially the programmable ones, was implanted in the field of radiation, it might be advisable to consider a possible relocation. Obviously, the battery life of a programmable pump can be reduced if the pump is close to the radiation field, whereas if the pump is directly in the field of radiotherapeutic treatment may happen that the battery discharges completely or malfunctions occur.Pain has always been associated with a poor prognosis, but it is unclear whether the prognosis was related to pain or disease that causes pain. ITDD reduces the pain, toxicity drugs-related and has been associated with improved survival in patients with cancer pain refractory as it reduces the immune system depression (4,5). ITDDs also causes a statistically significant reduction in the level of fatigue and decreased consciousness, allowing a better preservation of the social function and a greater desire to live. ( 6,7).The selection of cancer pain patients considered suitable for ITDD thus may not be based only on single items, but, of course, a multifactorial consideration could help in the development of a patient-centered regimen treatment.",Excluded

Strong task-specific effects (all P < 0.006) were consistent with previously published results. Direct comparisons of task-specific effects between the two sessions (magnetic field on or off) remained insignificance for all paradigms (RT: all P > 0.196; AC: all P > 0.17; no corrections for multiple comparisons).CONCLUSION: The results did not indicate any apparent safety concerns with respect to cognitive performance in a static magnetic field of a typical whole-body magnet.

1627,"Bnct combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas. INTRODUCTION: Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control. We have often treated RMGs using tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN, we herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT, and evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. METHOD(S): Two cohorts were included. The first and second cohorts were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, and between August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. They were followed by successive BV treatments. The first cohort was composed of 7 patients with RMGs (4 grade 4 and 3 grade 3 cases). The second cohort was composed of 6 patients with RMGs (5 grade 4 and 1 grade 3 cases). They were followed-up to April 2018. RESULT(S): Median OS and PFS after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively in the 1st cohort. Those in the second cohort were not reached. The OS data was compared with RPA classification for RMG as advocated by Carson et al. in a 2007 article in JCO. In both cohorts no symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred if BV could be continued. CTCAE grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Totally 11cases' OS in both cohorts were compared using JCO's RPA classification. Nine out of 11 cases showed longer OS in comparison with corresponding JCO's RPA classes. CONCLUSION(S): BNCT followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.",Excluded

595,"Solution X-ray scattering evidence for agonist- and antagonist-induced modulation of cleft closure in a glutamate receptor ligand-binding domain. Agonist-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of glutamate receptor ion channels provide the driving force for molecular rearrangements that mediate channel opening and subsequent desensitization. The resulting regulated transmembrane ion fluxes form the basis for most excitatory neuronal signaling in the brain. Crystallographic analysis of the GluR2 LBD core has revealed a ligand-binding cleft located between two lobes. Channel antagonists stabilize an open cleft, whereas agonists stabilize a closed cleft. The crystal structure of the apo form is similar to the antagonist-bound, open state. To understand the conformational behavior of the LBD in the absence of crystal lattice constraints, and thus better to appreciate the thermodynamic constraints on ligand binding, we have undertaken a solution x-ray scattering study using two different constructs encoding either the core or an extended LBD. In agreement with the GluR2 crystal structures, the LBD is more compact in the presence of agonist than it is in the presence of antagonist. However, the time-averaged conformation of the ligand-free core in solution is intermediate between the open, antagonist-bound state and the closed, agonist-bound state, suggesting a conformational equilibrium. Addition of peptide moieties that connect the core domain to the other functional domains in each channel subunit appears to constrain the conformational equilibrium in favor of the open state.",Excluded

1978,"Evaluation of absorbed dose in respiratory-gated radiotherapy using a phantom system that simulates patient respiration. [Japanese]. Respiratory-gated (RG) radiotherapy is useful for minimizing the irradiated volume of normal tissues resulting from the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. In this technique, although improvement in the dose distribution of the target can be expected, the actual absorbed dose distribution is not clearly determined. Therefore, it is important to clarify the absorbed dose at the tumor and at the evaluation points according to the patient's respiration. We have developed a phantom system that simulates patient respiration (TNK Co., Ltd.), to evaluate the absorbed dose and ensure precise RG radiotherapy. Actual patient respiratory signals were obtained using a respiratory synchronization and gating system (AZ-733V, Anzai Medical). The acquired data were then transferred to a phantom system driven by a ball screw to simulate the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. We measured the absorbed dose using a micro-ionization chamber dosimeter and the dose distribution using the film method for RG irradiation at expiratory phase by using Linac (PRIMUS, Toshiba Medical Systems Corp.) X-rays. When the distance of phantom movement was set to the average patient respiratory movement distance of 1.5 cm, we first compared absorbed dose with RG irradiation with a gating signal of 50% or less, and without RG irradiation. The absorbed dose at the iso-center was improved by 6.0% and 4.4% at a field size of 4x4 cm2, and by 1.3% and 0.7% at a field size of 5x5 cm2 with an X-ray energy of 6 MV and 10 MV, respectively. There was, however, no dose change at a field size of 10x10 cm2 and 15x15 cm2. When the gating signal was reduced to 25% and 10%, absorbed dose was also improved. With regard to the flatness of the dose profile, no changes in dose distribution were observed in the lateral direction, e.g., beam flatness was within 1.4% and 1.6% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively, with an X-ray energy of 6 MV. In the cranial-caudal direction, the dose profile was relatively large even if a gating signal of 50% was applied, i.e., 8.1% and 10.4% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. Beam flatness without RG was much worse, i.e., 37.8% and 38.2%, at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. In both cases, the dose was insufficient in the expiratory direction. Although RG radiotherapy is quite useful, the margins in the inspiratory and expiratory phases should be considered based on the level of gating signal and field size in order to formulate appropriate radiotherapy planning in terms of the shifting of internal structures. To ensure accurate radiotherapy, the characteristics of the RG irradiation technique and the radiotherapy equipment must be clearly understood when this technique is to be employed in clinical practice.",Excluded
423,"Phase I/II trial of simultaneous whole-brain irradiation and dose-escalating topotecan for brain metastases. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Topotecan penetrates the blood-brain barrier and sensitizes tumor cells against radiation. A phase I/II dose-escalating trial of repetitive daily i. v. topotecan application simultaneously with whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) was conducted to estimate toxicity, maximum tolerated dose and survival in patients with inoperable brain metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 47 patients suffering from previously untreated brain metastases, topotecan was applied on a daily i. v. schedule simultaneously with WBRT (36 Gy/3-Gy fractions). The infusion schedule started at the beginning of WBRT and was discontinued during weekends. Each infusion was completed within 1-2 h before irradiation. In a dose-finding study, topotecan was escalated from 5 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 8 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) to 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2).RESULTS: Altogether, 38/47 patients (81%) completed the prescribed schedule. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were dose-limiting. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 5/32 chemonaive patients (16%) and 7/15 patients (47%) with previous chemotherapy. At 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2), 2/4 patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia/thrombopenia. Nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild to moderate and unrelated to topotecan. Response evaluation was possible in 26/47 patients, overall response rate was 58% (CR [complete remission] 5/26, PR [partial remission] 10/26, NC [no change] 8/26). Median survival amounted to 5.1 months. In 15/42 patients (36%), brain metastases were the dominant cause of death.CONCLUSION: For a daily topotecan schedule simultaneous to WBRT, the maximum tolerated dose is 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) in chemonaive patients. For chemo-pretreated patients, daily doses should be reduced to 0.4 mg/m(2).

Limitations are seen in its inability to identify small calcifications and to distinguish clearly perifocal oedema and tumour especially in malignant lesions. Relatively thick slices of 5-10 mm make the detection of microadenomas very difficult, mainly because of partial volume effects.

The clinical and neuroimaging history, tumor histology, and follow-up studies were reviewed for all patients. Evidence as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging criteria and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology of carcinomatous meningitis was evaluated. The data were then analyzed to identify potential risk factors for the development of CSF dissemination.CONCLUSIONS: It appears that carcinomatous meningitis is exclusively identified in patients with adenocarcinoma, in particular with primary lung cancer. Furthermore, the incidence is higher if surgery is performed and the interval to subsequent GKS is prolonged.",Excluded

2363,"Orientation illusions in spaceflight. Investigations of spontaneous illusory reactions were carried out during space-flights of various durations by ANKETA questionnaires (104 cosmonauts). From a total of 104 cosmonauts, 24, in addition, used a dictaphone to record a verbal description of the illusions and their sensations on tape. Analysis of data generated by ANKETA and the tapes thus recorded have shown that during adaptation to weightlessness, 98% of cosmonauts have noted the occurrence of various illusions of orientation (coordinate and kinetic): illusions pertaining to their position or illusions of self- and surround-motion. The development of spatial orientation illusions during and after flight is not limited to certain individuals, but is a general response of the sensory system to microgravity. These responses differ to some extent among individuals in severity, nature, time and duration of occurrence, and the dynamics of the process. Perceptual disorders may occur even if the cosmonaut feels well and experiences no anomalous autonomic reactions. The nature of spatial illusions was determined by the role and relative contribution of various types of sensory input to spatial orientation. After completion of the initial stage of adaptation to weightlessness, the perceptual disorders disappear. However, spontaneous illusory reactions were often observed after 50 days of exposure to weightlessness. The adaptation process during long-term spaceflight had an undulating course, in which adaptation and de-adaptation alternated. A classification of weightlessness illusions is proposed.",Excluded
120,"Implementation of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index as a quantitative evaluation tool for dose distribution error detection. PURPOSE: To apply an imaging metric of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index to the radiotherapy dose verification field and evaluate its capability to reveal the different types of errors between two dose distributions.METHOD: The SSIM index consists of three sub-indices: luminance, contrast, and structure. Given two images, luminance analysis compares the local mean result, contrast analysis compares the local standard deviation, and the structure index represents the local Pearson correlation. Three test error patterns (absolute dose error, dose gradient error, and dose structure error) were designed to characterize the response of SSIM and its sub-indices and establish the correlation between the indices and different dose error types. After establishing the correlation, four radiotherapy plans (one MLC picket-fence test plan, one brain stereotactic radiotherapy plan, and two head-and-neck plans) were tested by computing each index and compared with the gamma analysis results to determine their similarities and differences.RESULTS: Among the three test error patterns, the luminance index decreased from 1 to 0.1 when the absolute dose agreement fell from 100% to 5%, the contrast index decreased from 1 to 0.36 when the dose gradient agreement fell from 100% to 10%, and the structure index decreased from 1 to 0.23 when the periodical dose pattern shifted (leading to a lower correlation). Thus, the luminance, contrast and structure index can detect the absolute dose error, gradient discrepancy, and dose structure error, respectively. For the four clinical cases, the sub-indices can reveal the type of error when gamma analysis only provided limited information.CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the subcomponents of the SSIM index and the error types of the dose distribution were established. The SSIM index provides additional error information compared to that provided by gamma analysis.",Excluded
2979,"Effects of lesions in some basal ganglia nuclei and efferent projections on tremorine-induced limb rigidity in rats. A mechanical apparatus was used to measure in rats the effects of some unilateral basal ganglia lesions on the hind-limb rigidity produced by the cholinomimetic compound, tremorine. A globus pallidus lesion reduced the resting tone and greatly increased rigidity in the contralateral leg. Lesions in the entopeduncular, subthalamic, and accumbens nuclei had no effects on rigidity, although the entopeduncular nucleus lesion reduced resting limb tone. The role of the globus pallidus in rigidity is significant in relation to work in which striatal lesions abolished tremorine-induced rigidity. Some brain regions that receive basal ganglia efferent fibers received a lesion unilaterally. Lesions in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, or pedunculopontine nucleus had no effect on tremorine-induced rigidity. A habenular lesion significantly reduced rigidity in both hind legs. Very pronounced reductions in rigidity occurred after midbrain lesions involving the central periaqueductal grey region and the superior colliculus. The basal ganglia output pathways that may mediate tremorine rigidity are discussed, together with the possibility that the superior colliculus, which has many muscarinic receptors, may be influenced directly by tremorine.",Excluded

Introduction: The applicability of ""Rubidium Chloride, <sup>82</sup>Rb from Generator"" radiopharmaceutical for brain tumors (BT) diagnostics is demonstrated on the basis of the application experience of the radiopharmaceutical in neurooncology. Experimental: A total of 21 patients with various brain tumors and nonneoplastic abnormal brain masses were investigated. Results and Discussions: The results of the imaging and differential diagnostics of malignant and benign tumors, nonneoplastic abnormal brain masses and lesions revealed the prevalence of high uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the malignant tumors in comparison with benign glioma and arteriovenous malformations in which <sup>82</sup>Rb-chloride accumulates in the vascular phase but does not linger further. The ultra-short half-life of radionuclide <sup>82</sup>Rb (76 s) along with a low absorbed radiation dose with <sup>82</sup>Rb-chloride by intravenous administration create a new possibility of successive use of two or more radiopharmaceuticals for the examination of the same patient.

This study was performed to find out the effect of mobile phone frequency on male Wistar rats. Animals were divided into two groups (n=6 in each group). Group one was considered as control and group two (experimental group) was exposed to microwave radiation (2100MHz) for 4 hours/day (5 days/week) for 3 months. Exposure of microwave radiation frequency showed significant alterations in cholinesterase activity, muscular strength, learning ability and anxiety. MWR exposure was also associated with significant alteration in the oxidative defense system and hippocampus degeneration. Histopathological observations clearly depicted the neural degeneration. Thus, it can be concluded that MWR significantly affects the central nervous system and may lead to many severe illnesses.

1596,"Myelomatous involvement of the dura mater: A rare complication of multiple myeloma. A case of myelomatous involvement of the dura mater is reported. The patient presented with blurring of vision in the right visual field and left sided facial numbness. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head revealed extensive infiltration of the dura mater. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no plasmacytosis and although there was a raised CSF protein concentration, no paraprotein band was detected, despite the presence of serum paraprotein. The infiltration of the dura mater is likely to have arisen by spread from contiguous bone lesions, contrasting with the pattern of spread seen in myelomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, which probably occurs through haematogenous seeding of the meninges. Leptomeningeal involvement is associated with a very poor prognosis; however, this patient had a favourable response to combined chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy, suggesting that myelomatous involvement of the dura mater should be considered as a distinct complication of myeloma.",Excluded
435,"Toward improved target conformity for two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems using dynamic collimation. Purpose: To quantify improvement in target conformity in brain and head and neck tumor treatments resulting from the use of a dynamic collimation system (DCS) with two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems (universal nozzle, UN, and dedicated nozzle, DN) with median spot sizes of 5.2 and 3.2 mm over a range of energies from 100 to 230 MeV. Method(s): Uncollimated and collimated plans were calculated with both UN and DN beam models implemented within our in-house treatment planning system for five brain and ten head and neck datasets in patients previously treated with spot scanning proton therapy. The prescription dose and beam angles from the clinical plans were used for both the UN and DN plans. The average reduction of the mean dose to the 10-mm ring surrounding the target between the uncollimated and collimated plans was calculated for the UN and the DN. Target conformity was analyzed using the mean dose to 1-mm thickness rings surrounding the target at increasing distances ranging from 1 to 10 mm. Result(s): The average reductions of the 10-mm ring mean dose for the UN and DN plans were 13.7% (95% CI: 11.6%-15.7%; p < 0.0001) and 11.5% (95% CI: 9.5%-13.5%; p < 0.0001) across all brain cases and 7.1% (95% CI: 4.4%-9.8%; p < 0.001) and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7%-9.0%; p < 0.001), respectively, across all head and neck cases. The collimated UN plans were either more conformal (all brain cases and 60% of the head and neck cases) than or equivalent (40% of the head and neck cases) to the uncollimated DN plans. The collimated DN plans offered the highest conformity. Conclusion(s): The DCS added either to the UN or DN improved the target conformity. The DCS may be of particular interest for sites with UN systems looking for a more economical solution than upgrading the nozzle to improve the target conformity of their spot scanning proton therapy system.

1695,"Gene expression signature to predict early development of brain metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma. Background: Advances in systemic treatment have substantially improved the overall survival of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients, and risk of brain metastases(BM) is higher. The survival of patients with symptomatic BM is poor. The identification of NSCLC patients with a high risk of developing BM would enable pre-emptive intervention to improve the outcome. Method(s): A total of 53 biopsies of primary lung tumor adenocarcinoma stage IV treatment-naive were analyzed for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST and were processed in R using Bioconductor libraries. All patients were evaluated with brain MRI at diagnosis with a 3-month follow-up for BM development. Patients were classified into two groups: early-BM( < 6 months) and late- BM( > 6 months). A second independent cohort of 55 patients was analyzed to validate the gene expression signature (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00862173 ). Result(s): Samples were classified as early-BM(17) and late-BM(6), the remainder 30 never developed BM. Significant changes in gene expression of about100 genes were found. Eleven highly significant genes (B-stat > 12) were associated with process of cell-migrationCNN3(down- reg.) and adhesionCDH10(up-reg); anti-apoptosisBAG1(up-reg); immunological evasionSSX2(up-reg) and RAET1E(up-reg); signaling pathways related to RAS gene RAB9A(up-reg) and RAPGEF5(down-reg); mRNA-tRNA translocationDUS2L(up-reg); methylation controlNOC2L(up-reg); and members of the EGFR family EPGN(up-reg) and IGFR, IGF2BP1(up-reg).

The functions of the diverse retinal ganglion cell types in primates and the parallel visual pathways they initiate remain poorly understood. Here, unusual physiological and computational properties of the ON and OFF smooth monostratified ganglion cells are explored. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings from 48 macaque retinas revealed that these cells exhibit irregular receptive field structure composed of spatially segregated hotspots, quite different from the classic center-surround model of retinal receptive fields. Surprisingly, visual stimulation of different hotspots in the same cell produced spikes with subtly different spatiotemporal voltage signatures, consistent with a dendritic contribution to hotspot structure. Targeted visual stimulation and computational inference demonstrated strong nonlinear subunit properties associated with each hotspot, supporting a model in which the hotspots apply nonlinearities at a larger spatial scale than bipolar cells. These findings reveal a previously unreported nonlinear mechanism in the output of the primate retina that contributes to signaling spatial information.",Excluded

1004,"Hepatic iron loading and oxidative stress in ataxia-telangiectasia mice. Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in a myriad of abnormalities including progressive neurodegeneration, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to ionising radiation. At a cellular level A-T is a disease of chronic oxidative stress (OS) resulting from reduced antioxidant defence capacity leading to the oxidative damage of proteins, lipids, and DNA. Transition metals such as Fe<sup>2/+</sup> act as pro-oxidative molecules, catalysing the conversion of weakly reactive oxygen species such as H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, causing significant oxidative damage. Cellular iron accumulation and the resultant OS has also been linked to the neurodegeneration seen in Alzheimer0s and Parkinson's diseases, lymphoid tumours (which occur in approximately 30% of A-T patients), and ionising radiation hypersensitivity. To investigate iron regulation in A-T, iron indices, iron regulatory gene expression, and markers of oxidative stress were studied in livers of wild-type and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) null mice on a control diet and when challenged with a high iron diet. At 10 weeks of age, Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a control diet had increased serum iron, hepatic iron and ferritin, with significantly up-regulated hepcidin (Hamp1) expression compared to wild-type mice. When challenged with the high iron diet Bone morphogenetic protein 6, Hfe, and Ferroportin were all significantly up-regulated in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> compared to wild-type mice. Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice also had significantly higher hepatic OS that increased disproportionately in animals fed the high iron diet. In summary, we have demonstrated that Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a propensity to accumulate iron in spite of the appropriate regulation of genes involved in iron homeostasis. The increased hepatic iron in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice is associated with a disproportionately large increase in hepatic OS. Our results suggest that increased iron status may contribute to the chronic OS seen in A-T patients.",Excluded
3505,"Autofluorescence spectroscopy as a proxy for chronic white matter pathology. Background: The balance of tissue injury and repair ultimately determines outcomes of chronic neurological disorders, such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the extent of pathology can be difficult to detect, particularly when it is insidious and/or offset by tissue regeneration. Objective(s): The objective of this research is to evaluate whether tissue autofluorescence-typically a source of contamination-provides a surrogate marker of white matter injury. Method(s): Tissue autofluorescence in autopsied specimens both experimental and clinical was characterized by spectral confocal microscopy and correlated to severity and chronicity as determined by standard histopathology. Result(s): Months after cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination, despite robust remyelination, autofluorescent deposits progressively accumulated in regions of prior pathology. Autofluorescent deposits (likely reflecting myelin debris remnants) were conspicuously localized to white matter, proportional to lesion severity, and displayed differential fluorescence over time. Strikingly, similar features were apparent also in autopsied MS tissue. Conclusion(s): Autofluorescence spectroscopy illuminates prior and ongoing white matter injury. The accumulation of autofluorescence in proportion to the extent of progressive atrophy, despite robust remyelination in the CPZ brain, provides important proof-of-concept of a phenomenon (insidious ongoing damage masked by mechanisms of tissue repair) that we hypothesize is highly relevant to the progressive phase of MS.

PURPOSE: To evaluate stochastic and deterministic risks associated with neurointerventional procedures for the patient.METHODS: Eight neurovascular interventional procedures were evaluated to determine the entrance skin dose and effective dose for the patient. Dosimetry was done with thermoluminescence dosimeters. The highest dose on the patient's head was recorded as the maximum entrance skin dose. The equivalent dose was obtained by conversion of the dose-area product using published conversion tables.RESULTS: The maximum entrance skin dose varied from 129 to 1335 mGy. The mean effective dose was 1.67 mSv with a range of 0.44 to 3.44 mSv. No deterministic effect has been encountered. Stochastic risk linked to the highest effective dose value was approximately one death by fatal cancer for every 6000 procedures, according to the new International Commission on Radiological Protection coefficient.CONCLUSIONS: Because no deterministic effect has been detected, and stochastic risks were very low, radiation hazard to the patient is a minor consideration in deciding whether to undertake a neurointerventional procedure.",Excluded

Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the sole imaging modality for patient modeling in radiation therapy (RT) is a challenging task due to the need to derive electron density information from MRI and construct a so-called pseudo-computed tomography (pCT) image. We have previously published a new method to derive pCT images from head T1-weighted (T1-w) MR images using a single-atlas propagation scheme followed by a post hoc correction of the mapped CT numbers using local intensity information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of our method with head zero echo time (ZTE) MR images. To evaluate results, the mean absolute error in bins of 20 HU was calculated with respect to the true planning CT scan of the patient. We demonstrated that applying our method using ZTE MR images instead of T1-w improved the correctness of the pCT in case of bone resection surgery prior to RT (that is, an example of large anatomical difference between the atlas and the patient).",Excluded

The temporal dynamics of the response of neurons in the outer retina were investigated by intracellular recording from cones, bipolar, and horizontal cells in the intact, light-adapted retina of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), with special emphasis on comparing the two major classes of bipolars cells, the ON depolarizing bipolars (Bd) and the OFF hyperpolarizing bipolars (Bh). Transfer functions were computed from impulse responses evoked by a brief light flash on a steady background of 20 cd/m(2). Phase delays ranged from about 89 ms for cones to 170 ms for Bd cells, yielding delays relative to that of cones of about 49 ms for Bh cells and 81 ms for Bd cells. The difference between Bd and Bh cells, which may be due to a delay introduced by the second messenger G-protein pathway unique to Bd cells, was further quantified by latency measurements and responses to white noise. The amplitude transfer functions of the outer retinal neurons varied with light adaptation in qualitative agreement with results for other vertebrates and human vision. The transfer functions at 20 cd/m(2) were predominantly low pass with 10-fold attenuation at about 13, 14, 9.1, and 7.7 Hz for cones, horizontal, Bh, and Bd cells, respectively. The transfer function from the cone voltage to the bipolar voltage response, as computed from the above measurements, was low pass and approximated by a cascade of three low pass RC filters (""leaky integrators""). These results for cone-->bipolar transmission are surprisingly similar to recent results for rod-->bipolar transmission in salamander slice preparations. These and other findings suggest that the rate of vesicle replenishment rather than the rate of release may be a common factor shaping synaptic signal transmission from rods and cones to bipolar cells.",Excluded

When occurring, CSF leaks can be shown by demonstrating a ""path"" from the cranial fossage into the nasal cavity. The present technique utilizes tampons placed in each nostril. A positive diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea is made by finding a tampon impregnated with at least twice the radioactivity of a control tampon from the opposite nostril (in the presence of an intact septum).

3217,"Variation in radiation sensitivity and repair kinetics in different parts of the spinal cord. BACKGROUND: The spinal cord, known for its strongly serial character and high sensitivity to radiation even when a small segment is irradiated, is one of the most critical organs at risk to be spared during radiation therapy. To compare the sensitivity of different parts of the spinal cord, data for radiation myelopathy have been used.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, the relative seriality model was fitted to two different datasets of clinical radiation myelitis concerning cervical spinal cord after treating 248 patients for head and neck cancer and thoracic spinal cord after treating 43 patients with lung carcinoma. The maximum likelihood method was applied to fit the clinical data. The model parameters and their 68% confidence intervals were calculated for each dataset. The alpha/beta ratio for the thoracic cord was also was also found to be 0.9 (0-3.0) Gy.RESULTS: The dose-response curve for the more sensitive cervical myelopathy is well described by the parameters D(50)=55.9 (54.8-57.1) Gy, gamma=6.9 (5.0-9.2), s=0.13 (0.07-0.24), whereas the thoracic myelopathy is described by the parameters D(50)=75.5 (70.5-80.8) Gy, gamma=1.1 (0.6-1.6), s=36 (3.3-infinity).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in radiation response between the cervical and thoracic region of spinal cord are thus observed: cervical myelopathy seems to be characterized by medium seriality, while thoracic spinal cord is characterized by a highly serial dose-response. The much steeper dose-response curve for cervical spinal cord myelopathy can be interpreted as a higher number of functional subunits consistent with a higher amount of white matter close to the brain.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Skin reactions and pain are commonly reported side effects of radiation therapy (RT).OBJECTIVE: To characterize RT-induced symptoms according to treatment site subgroups and identify skin symptoms that correlate with pain.METHODS: A self-report survey-adapted from the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and the McGill Pain Questionnaire--assessed RT-induced skin problems, pain, and specific skin symptoms. Wilcoxon Sign Ranked tests compared mean severity or pre- and post-RT pain and skin problems within each RT-site subgroup. Multiple linear regression (MLR) investigated associations between skin symptoms and pain.RESULTS: Survey respondents (N = 106) were 58% female and on average 64 years old. RT sites included lung, breast, lower abdomen, head/neck/brain, and upper abdomen. Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in treatment site pain and skin problems (P < or = .007). Patients receiving head/neck/brain RT reported increased skin problems (P < .0009). MLR showed that post-RT skin tenderness and tightness were most strongly associated with post-RT pain (P = .066 and P = .122, respectively).LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, exploratory analyses, and nonvalidated measure.CONCLUSIONS: Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in pain and skin problems at the RT site while patients receiving head/neck/brain RT had increased skin problems but not pain. These findings suggest that the severity of skin problems is not the only factor that contributes to pain and that interventions should be tailored to specifically target pain at the RT site, possibly by targeting tenderness and tightness. These findings should be confirmed in a larger sampling of RT patients.",Excluded

420,"Characterisation of GafchromicTM EBT3 dosimetric film for use at high dose levels in commissioning of radiosurgery. Aim: A robust tool is required for the dosimetric verification of high dose small fields associated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (SRT). The response characteristics of EBT3 have been determined for the high dose range. The application of the film in SRS/SRT quality assurance testing has been evaluated. Method(s): The response characteristics of EBT3 (Lot# 07221303) were examined using an Epson Expression 10000XL flatbed scanner in combination with ImageJ and RIT software. Red, green and blue channel responses were analysed for 0-40 Gy. Green channel inter and intra film uniformity, dose rate dependence and post exposure darkening were characterised at high doses. Film uniformity was compared using two films from the same batch, each divided into 16 equal pieces and irradiated with 15 Gy. The characterisation was complemented by verifying a cranial SRS treatment with the film positioned in a LucyTM phantom. Result(s): The dose response curves of the three colour channels were compared across a 0-40 Gy dose range. Green channel analysis was found to be optimal for doses above 10 Gy due to its wider dynamic range. The dose response curves of two 6 MV beams delivered at 1000 MU/min and 600 MU/min rep rate across a 0-40 Gy dose range were found to agree with a maximum variation of 1.3%. The postirradiation darkening of EBT3 for 10, 15 and 25 Gy was determined. The dose distribution of an iPlanTM SRS treatment was verified. Conclusion(s): The new generation EBT3 film is suitable for use with high doses up to the manufacturer's recommended limit of 40 Gy. Analysis with the green channel is recommended. Calibration at the dose rate used for delivery should be considered.",Excluded
3538,"A strategy for the use of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on linear accelerators and its impact on treatment margins for prostate cancer patients. Background and Purpose: In external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer, the consideration of various systematic error types leads to wide treatment margins compromising normal tissue tolerance. We investigated if systematic set-up errors can be reduced by a set of initial image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) sessions. Patients and Methods: 27 patients received daily IGRT resulting in a set of 882 cone-beam computed tomographies (CBCTs). After matching to bony structures, we analyzed the dimensions of remaining systematic errors from zero up to six initial IGRT sessions and aimed at a restriction of daily IGRT for 10% of all patients. For threshold definition, we determined the standard deviations (SD) of the shift corrections and selected patients out of this range for daily image guidance. To calculate total treatment margins, we demanded for a cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) coverage of at least 95% of the specified dose in 90% of all patients. Result(s): The gain of accuracy was largest during the first three IGRTs. In order to match precision and workload criteria, thresholds for the SD of the corrections of 3.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 4.5 mm in the left-right (L-R), cranial-caudal (C-C), and anterior-posterior (A-P) direction, respectively, were identified. Including all other error types, the total margins added to the CTV amounted to 8.6 mm in L-R, 10.4 mm in C-C, and 14.4 mm in A-P direction. Conclusion(s): Only initially performed IGRT might be helpful for eliminating gross systematic errors especially after virtual simulation. However, even with daily IGRT performance, a substantial PTV margin reduction is only achievable by matching internal markers instead of bony anatomical structures. Â© 2008 Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
1249,"Outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for arubaeligible patients. Introduction: The ARUBA trial is designed to determine whether medical management improves long-term outcomes in patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) compared to interventional therapy. Method(s): Retrospective review of 164 ARUBA-eligible patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) from 1990-2005 with more than two years of follow-up. The median patient age was 42.8 years. Sixty-five AVMs (40%) were Spetzler-Martin grade I-II; the median radiosurgery-based AVM score (RBAS) was 1.48. The median follow-up was 67.5 months; 44 patients (27%) had 10 or more years of follow-up. Result(s): Fifteen patients (9%) bled at a median of 21 months (range, 7-70) after SRS. Six patients (4%) had new deficits and 4 patients died (2%). The risk of stroke was 10% at 5-years and 11% at 10-years. Twelve additional patients (7%) had a Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) decline from either radiation-related complications (n=7) or subsequent resection (n=5). The risk of MRS decline was 13% at 5-years and 16% at 10-years. Factors associated with MRS decline were increasing AVM volume (P=0.002), higher AVM grade (P=0.01), and higher RBAS (P=0.002). The 5-year and 10-year risk of MRS decline for patients with Spetzler- Martin grade I-II AVMs or a RBAS less than 1.5 was 5%. Conclusion(s): Although the observed risk of stroke and MRS decline after SRS was similar to the expected risk in the medical management group of ARUBA at the planned follow-up interval of that trial (5-year risk, 5%-20%), younger patients with small, unruptured AVMs may benefit from SRS compared to medical management at longer follow-up periods.",Excluded

For intracerebral N29 tumors, single-fraction radiation therapy with 5 or 15 Gy had no significant effect on the survival time. Immunization with IFN-gamma-transfected N29 cells significantly increased the survival time by 61%. Single-fraction radiation therapy with 5 Gy combined with immunization increased the survival time significantly by 87% and complete remissions by 75% while with 15 Gy the survival time increased 45% with 38% complete remissions. For intracerebral N32 tumors, single-fraction radiation therapy with 15 Gy increased the survival time significantly by 20%. Immunization by itself had no significant effect with IFN-gamma-transfected N32 cells, but combined with 15 Gy single-fraction radiation therapy it increased survival time significantly by 40%, although there were no complete remissions.

1869,"Feasibility of setting up generic alert levels for maximum skin dose in fluoroscopically guided procedures. Purpose: The feasibility of setting-up generic, hospital-independent dose alert levels to initiate vigilance on possible skin injuries in interventional procedures was studied for three high-dose procedures (chemoembolization (TACE) of the liver, neuro-embolization (NE) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) in 9 European countries. Method(s): Gafchromic films and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the Maximum Skin Dose (MSD). Correlation of the online dose indicators (fluoroscopy time, kerma- or dose-area product (KAP or DAP) and cumulative air kerma at interventional reference point (K<inf>a,r</inf>)) with MSD was evaluated and used to establish the alert levels corresponding to a MSD of 2 Gy and 5 Gy. The uncertainties of alert levels in terms of DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf>, and uncertainty of MSD were calculated. Result(s): About 20-30% of all MSD values exceeded 2 Gy while only 2-6% exceeded 5 Gy. The correlations suggest that both DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf> can be used as a dose indicator for alert levels (Pearson correlation coefficient p mostly >0.8), while fluoroscopy time is not suitable (p mostly <0.6). Generic alert levels based on DAP (Gy cm<sup>2</sup>) were suggested for MSD of both 2 Gy and 5 Gy (for 5 Gy: TACE 750, PCI 250 and NE 400). The suggested levels are close to the lowest values published in several other studies. The uncertainty of the MSD was estimated to be around 10-15% and of hospital-specific skin dose alert levels about 20-30% (with coverage factor k = 1). Conclusion(s): The generic alert levels are feasible for some cases but should be used with caution, only as the first approximation, while hospital-specific alert levels are preferred as the final approach.

1207,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro. Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K+ conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow after hyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (5 microM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow after hyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca(2+)-spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow after hyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded

Cognitive toxicity induced by cranial radiation is one of the most important limitations of radiation therapy and has a significant impact on brain tumor survivors' quality of life. This review comprehends an up to date of recent studies including complete neuropsychological battery and/or advanced neuroimaging techniques. These studies identified critical anatomical and/or functional brain areas related to radiation-induced brain injury, thus improving clinical and radiological diagnosis. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive toxicity are complex and involve different cell lines and molecules. Although there is no currently therapeutic strategy that has a demonstrated efficacy, several studies including sparing of hippocampus or the use of memantine are quite promising. A better knowledge of the characteristics of cognitive toxicity induced by cranial radiation, will help us to identify patients who will benefit from treatment and also to examine new therapeutic targets in order to improve patients' quality of life.

1211,"Persistent calcium current in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons. The suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the primary circadian clock, and suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons exhibit a diurnal modulation of spontaneous firing rate. The present study examined the voltage-gated persistent Ca(2+) current, in acutely isolated rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons using a ramp-type voltage-clamp protocol. Slow triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -85 mV to +5 mV elicited inward current (100-400 pA) that was completely blocked by Cd(2+). This current showed little or no hysteresis, and was identified as persistent Ca(2+) current. The threshold for persistent Ca(2+) current ranged between -60 and -45 mV, and it was maximal at about -8 mV. Nifedipine at 10-20 microM blocked 80-100%. To assess the role of persistent Ca(2+) current in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in both acutely isolated and intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons, the effect of Cd(2+) and nifedipine on firing rate was studied using on-cell recording. Application of Cd(2+) exerted a weak excitatory effect and nifedipine had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing rate of isolated suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. In all intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations (n=15), Cd(2+) slowly inhibited spontaneous firing; in high-frequency firing cells (four of 15), a transient increase of firing rate preceded inhibition. No significant effect of nifedipine on firing rate of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons was found. Therefore, persistent Ca(2+) current itself (as carrier of charge) does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous firing of suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. A slowly developing inhibitory effect of Cd(2+) on spontaneous firing of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations may be due to penetration of Cd(2+) through Ca(2+) channels, and its subsequent effect on intracellular mechanisms, while the transient increase of firing rate in high-frequency firing neurons is probably due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current.",Excluded

Current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and its function for memory formation in the behaving animal is limited. NMDAR-independent LTP in the CA1 region is thought to require activity of postsynaptic L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Cav1.x), but the underlying channel isoform remains unknown. We evaluated the function of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel for spatial learning, synaptic plasticity, and triggering of learning-associated biochemical processes using a mouse line with an inactivation of the CACNA1C (Cav1.2) gene in the hippocampus and neocortex (Cav1.2(HCKO)). This model shows (1) a selective loss of protein synthesis-dependent NMDAR-independent Schaffer collateral/CA1 late-phase LTP (L-LTP), (2) a severe impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and (3) decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and reduced cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent transcription in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results provide strong evidence for a role of L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent, NMDAR-independent hippocampal L-LTP in the formation of spatial memory in the behaving animal and for a function of the MAPK/CREB (CRE-binding protein) signaling cascade in linking Cav1.2 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx to either process.",Excluded

Dose area product was analyzed in addition to surgical data. Once preoperative simulation was established, 66 cases (SIM cohort) were compared with 66 patients who had previously undergone MIS-HLIF without preoperative simulation (NO-SIM cohort).RESULTS: Dose area product was reduced considerably in the SIM cohort (320 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup> NO-SIM cohort: 470 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup>; P < 0.01).

1739,"Understanding and tackling differing vascular niches in glioma. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most belligerent adult brain tumor, which is defined by its aggressive growth due to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, diffuse infiltration and invasion, propensity for necrosis and hypoxia, and vigorous angiogenesis. Recurrence of these invasive tumors is inevitable despite advanced multimodal therapy with surgery followed by radiation and temozolomide treatment resulting in a dismal median survival of beyond one year. A recent milestone in glioma research has been the revelation that therapies targeting other cell types besides tumor cells; i.e., the cell constituents of the vascular niche can convey substantial improvements in radiographic response, progression-free survival, and quality of life. The changing perspective on the environment as a functional contributor represents a profound shift in the approach to biology and therapeutic decisions in GBM. Here, we describe paracrine signaling pathways of the differing vascular niches that regulate angiogenesis or tumor invasiveness and present therapeutic modalities to target those to more efficiently block diffuse and angiogenic GBM growth.",Excluded
1743,"PET imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease. In the past four decades, PET (positron emission tomography) imaging has been developed into a common diagnostic tool. After an i.v. injection of a small amount of radioactive probe, PET images are taken based on the decay of shortlived positron-emitting isotopes. The emitted positron collides with a neighboring electron to produce two 511 KeV gamma rays roughly 180 apart. It is based on this physical principal and the positron coincident signals that the point source of the gamma rays can be deduced by using a coincident circuit for detectors 180 apart. Currently, there are three FDA-approved imaging agents (Amyvid, NeuraCeq, and Vizamyl) available for mapping Abeta in the brain of patients suspected of having Alzheimer's disease. There is a strong interest in measuring tau deposition by PET imaging in a quantitative manner. Several useful Tau imaging agents have been tested in humans; however, they have not been fully validated as those of Abeta imaging agents.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical subgroups using an empirically identified psychoneurologic symptom cluster (depressed mood, cognitive disturbance, fatigue, insomnia, and pain) and to examine the differences among subgroups in the selected demographic and clinical variables, as well as in patient outcome (i.e., functional performance).DESIGN: Secondary analysis.SETTING: A university health science center in Salt Lake City, UT, and a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in Philadelphia, PA.SAMPLE: 282 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy.METHODS: Cluster analyses were conducted to identify subgroups. Multinomial logistic regression and one-way analyses of variance were used to examine the differences among subgroups.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Depressed mood, cognitive disturbance, fatigue, insomnia, pain, and functional performance.FINDINGS: Patients were classified into four distinct subgroups based on their symptom cluster experience: all low symptom, high fatigue and low pain, high pain, and all high symptom. Such patient classification patterns were consistent across the treatment trajectory, although group memberships were inconsistent. After initiating treatment, two additional subgroups emerged: high depressed mood and cognitive disturbance, and high fatigue and insomnia. Subgroups differed in physical performance status at baseline, symptom burden, and treatment modality in a relatively consistent pattern across time points. Patients in the all-high-symptom subgroup experienced the most serious limitations in activities across all time points.CONCLUSIONS: Patient subgroups exist that share the unique experience of psychoneurologic symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings are useful to determine who needs more intensive symptom management during cancer treatment.

Background: After each cycle of [<sup>177</sup>Lu]-DOTA-TATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) dosimetry is performed to enable precise calculation of the radiation-absorbed dose to tumors and normal organs. Absorbed doses are routinely calculated from three quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies corrected by computed tomography (CT) acquired at t<inf>1</inf> = 24 h, t<inf>2</inf> = 96 h, and t<inf>3</inf> = 168 h after the first cycle of treatment. After following cycles, a single SPECT/CT study is performed. The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility of a ""two time point"" quantitative SPECT/CT protocol after the first PRRT cycle and its impact on patient management. Quantitative SPECT/CT data of 25 consecutive patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors after PRRT were retrospectively analyzed. Radiation-absorbed doses calculated using the standard protocol with three SPECT/CT studies acquired at (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>2</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) were compared to those obtained from three different ""two time point"" protocols with SPECT/CT studies performed at (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>2</inf>), (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>), or (t<inf>2</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>). Result(s): The best agreement for the cumulative doses absorbed by the kidneys, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and tumors with the conventional protocol was obtained with the (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) protocol with mean relative differences of - 1.0% +/- 2.4%, 0.4% +/- 3.1%, - 0.9% +/- 4.0%, - 0.8% +/- 1.1%, and - 0.5% +/- 2.0%, respectively, and correlation coefficients of r = 0.99 for all. In all patients, there was no difference in the management decision of whether or not to stop PRRT because of unsafe absorbed dose to risk organs using either the standard protocol or the (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) protocol. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results demonstrate that dosimetry calculations using two quantitative SPECT/CT studies acquired at 24 and 168 h after the first PRRT cycle are feasible and are in good agreement with the standard imaging protocol with no change in patient management decisions, while enabling improved patient comfort and reduced scanner and staff time.

CONTEXT: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is established as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the radiation exposure and cost of computed tomography (CT) measurements limits its daily clinical use.OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to compare the degree of agreement between VAT measurements by a new dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) application and one of the standard methods, CT, in a population of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) before and after GH treatment. Furthermore, we tested whether VAT estimations by these two methods are equivalent in assessing the metabolic risk in this population.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Data from the Norwegian population of a multicenter study in adults with genetically proven PWS were used. Subjects with complete anthropometry, biochemical, and imagistic measurements at all study visits (baseline and after 12 and 24 months of GH treatment) (n = 14, six men) were included. VAT was quantified both using CT scans (GE Lightspeed 16 Pro) of the abdomen at L2-L3 level and a total body DXA scan (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy).RESULTS: VAT DXA was strongly associated with VAT CT at baseline (r = 0.97) and after 12 (r = 0.90) and 24 months (r = 0.89) of GH treatment (all P < .001). We found moderate to strong positive correlations between VAT by both methods, and blood pressure, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glucose metabolism, and other fat depots (arms, legs, android, trunk, total body) but no association with age, gender, blood lipids, and IGF-I. Adiponectin was negatively associated with the amount of VAT. At baseline, the highest correlation with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was found for VAT DXA (r = 0.76, P = .001) and VAT CT (r = 0.75, P = .002), respectively.CONCLUSION: VAT can be accurately estimated by DXA, in patients with PWS, and might contribute to the assessment of the metabolic risk.",Excluded

Details of surgical procedures, radiotherapy, symptoms at presentation and follow-up and neurological findings were recorded. Patients were reviewed at six or 12 monthly intervals for 2-19 years (median 9.5 years). Investigations included blood tests, chest X-ray, bone scan, neurophysiological studies, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and cerebrospinal fluid examination.RESULTS: Symptoms began from six months to 20 years after radiotherapy (median time 1.5 years). Progressive weakness was universal and resulted in loss of any useful hand function in all but three patients. The time taken to loss of useful hand function ranged from six weeks to five years (median 1.25 years). Three patterns of upper limb weakness were identified, distal limb weakness only (13 patients), global limb weakness that was more marked distally (11 patients), and completely flaccid arm (10 patients). Seventeen patients required long-term morphine to palliate pain. A chemical sympathectomy benefited three patients.CONCLUSIONS: Most patients developed symptoms within three years, but late presentations 8-20 years later were encountered. Symptoms were progressive in all patients, though the rate did vary. Pain was common and persisted indefinitely in all but one patient.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on the antioxidant enzymatic system (such as GPx, GR and SOD), GSH and selenium level in liver, kidney, muscle and brain of static magnetic field (SMF) exposed rats. Male adult rats were divided into control rats (n=6), SMF-exposed rats (128 mT; 1h/day for 5 days), selenium-treated rats (Na(2)SeO(3), 0.2mg/l, in drinking water for 4 weeks) and co-exposed rats (selenium for 4 weeks and SMF during the last 5 consecutive days). Sub-acute exposure to SMF induces a decrease of selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain. Our results also revealed a decrease of GPx activities in kidney and muscle. By contrast, SMF exposure increased total GSH levels and total SOD activities in liver, while glutathione reductase activity is unaffected. Selenium supplementation in SMF-exposed rats restored selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain and elevated the activities of GPx in kidney and muscle to those of control group. In the liver, selenium supplementation failed to bring down the elevated levels of total GSH and SOD activity.

PURPOSE: [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 is a selective, high-affinity positron emission tomography tracer for imaging neurofibrillary tangles, a key pathological signature that correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease. This report provides safety information from preclinical toxicology studies and first-in-human whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry studies of [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 for its potential application in human brain imaging studies.PROCEDURES: MK-6240 was administered intravenously (IV) in a 7-day rat toxicity study at x 50, x 100, and x 1000 dose margins relative to projected highest clinical dose of 0.333 mug/kg. The IV formulation of MK-6240 for clinical use and the formulation used in the 7-day rat toxicity study was tested for hemolysis potential in human and Wistar rat whole blood. Sequential whole-body positron emission tomography scans were performed in three healthy young subjects after IV bolus injection of 180 +/- 0.3 MBq [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 to characterize organ biodistribution and estimate whole-body radiation exposure (effective dose).RESULTS: MK-6240 administered IV in a 7-day rat toxicity study did not show any test article-related changes. The no-observed-adverse-effect level in rats was >= 333 mug/kg/day which provides a margin 1000-fold over an anticipated maximum clinical dose of 0.333 mug/kg. Additionally, the MK-6240 formulation was not hemolytic in human or Wistar rat blood. [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 activity was widely distributed to the brain and the rest of the body, with organ absorbed doses largest for the gall bladder (202 muGy/MBq). The average (+/-SD) effective dose was 29.4 +/- 0.6 muSv/MBq, which is in the typical range for F-18 radiolabeled ligands.CONCLUSIONS: Microdoses of [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 are safe for clinical positron emission tomography imaging studies. Single IV administration of 185 MBq (5 mCi) [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 is anticipated to result in a total human effective dose of 5.4 mSv and thus allows multiple positron emission tomography scans of the same subject per year.",Excluded
1020,"Outwitting the blood-brain barrier for therapeutic purposes: osmotic opening and other means. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews historical aspects of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and recent advances in mechanisms to deliver therapeutic agents across the BBB for the treatment of intracerebral tumors and other neurological diseases.METHODS: The development of the osmotic BBB disruption procedure as a clinically useful technique is described. Osmotic BBB disruption is contrasted with alternative methods for opening or bypassing the BBB, including pharmacological modification of the BBB with bradykinin and direct intracerebral infusion.RESULTS: Laboratory studies have played a fundamental role in advancing our understanding of the BBB and delivery of agents to brain. Preclinical animal studies will continue to serve an integral function in our efforts to improve the diagnosis and treatment of a number of neurological disorders. Techniques involving the modification of the BBB and/or blood-tumor barrier to increase delivery of therapeutic agents have been advanced to clinical trials in patients with brain tumors with very favorable results.CONCLUSION: Improving delivery of agents to the brain will play a major role in the therapeutic outcome of brain neoplasms. As techniques for gene therapy are advanced, manipulation of the BBB also may be important in the treatment of central nervous system genetic disorders. [References: 77]",Excluded

Adult AMES mice and male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to an artificial magnetic field, generated by Helmholtz coils. 3.5 hours after the onset of darkness the coils were activated for one hour resulting in an inversion of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field. The coils were activated and deactivated at 5 min intervals during the 1 hour exposure period. In both mice and rats, the levels of serotonin in the pineal were markedly increased by the exposure. In rats, an increase of pineal 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and a decrease of the activity of the pineal enzyme serotonin-N-acetyltransferase also was observed. However, pineal and serum melatonin levels were not altered. The results indicate that the metabolism of serotonin in the pineal is quickly affected by the exposure of animals to a magnetic field.",Excluded

Mobile phone usage has been increased in the last few years emitting electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which disturbs normal cellular processes via oxidative stress. L-cysteine, a glutathione precursor, prevents oxidative damage. Transdermal patches (TDPs) loaded with L-cysteine hydrochloride (L-CyS-HCL) were fabricated by dispersion of L-CyS-HCL 5% w/w and different concentrations of sorbitol as a plasticizer in room-temperature vulcanizable synthetic silicone matrices (RTV-Si). The effect of sorbitol on patch physicochemical parameters was assessed; in-vitro L-CyS-HCL release profiles and ex-vivo permeation were studied. Pharmacokinetic parameters of endogenous synthetized in-vivo glutathione, after receiving IV bolus dose of L-CyS-HCl and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs were studied in rat model. The influence of L-CyS-HCL-RTV-Si-TDPs against damaging effects of mobile phone EMR on rats' blood and brain tissues was studied. The results revealed that patch plasticity, intensity reflections, surface porosity, L-CyS-HCL release rate and skin permeation increased with increasing sorbitol concentration. Pharmacokinetic profile for IV dose and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs revealed that the L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs provided a sustained glutathione plasma concentration-time profile over entire patch application. High significant differences in biological parameters (blood and brain samples) were observed for radiated rats using the patch in study compared with positive control rats. Promising long-term strategy for protection against mobile phone hazards was obtained. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors",Excluded
1618,"Effect of microradiosurgical transections upon kainate seizure focus. Multiple subpial transections (MST) sever horizontal intracortical fibers involved in the propagation of seizures, while preserving vertical fibers which are essential for brain function. Less damaging to the brain than a traditional resection,MST still exposes patients to the risks of craniotomy. Microradiosurgery uses synchrotron generated sub-millimetric beams of radiation. Arrays of tightly spaced microbeams produce a lethal effect only to those cells directly in the beam path. Low energy x-rays used for microradiosurgery have a small tissue half-value layer making the technique ideal for treating superficial brain lesions. Video-EEG (VEEG) data was recorded immediately following kainate injected into sensorimotor cortex. Rats then underwent irradiation with an array of parallel microbeams delivered to the seizure focus.Subclinical electrographic ictal events remained frequent up to 10 hours post irradiation. More prolonged seizures exhibited typical rat complex partial seizure semiologies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recording VEEG before and after precise microbeam irradiation from a synchrotron source; demonstrating a methodology which will be useful for future experiments serving to optimize microbeam doses and configuration in preparation for the treatment of epilepsy in humans. The results show some promise that microradiosurgical MST can limit the spread of seizures without causing clinically evident neurological damage.",Excluded

The effects of Ga-Al-As diode laser (830 nm, 16.2 mW) irradiation on the distal portion of the processes of cultured murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons associated with C-fibers were studied by patch-clamp whole-cell recording of membrane potentials at the cell body. The chemical as well as laser light stimulations were limited to the processes of the neuron isolated from the cell body with a separator. The action potentials elicited by bradykinin (BK) in the cell body were reversibly suppressed by the irradiation of laser light. The laser irradiation may block the conduction of nociceptive signals in primary afferent neurons. The present experimental method offers a simple and easy to use procedure for studying the pain relief effects by laser irradiation.",Excluded

332,"Isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage in mild traumatic brain injury: is a repeat CT scan necessary? A single-institution retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage (iSAH) is a common finding in the emergency department. In many centers, a repeat CT scan is routinely performed 24 to72 h following the trauma to rule out further radiological progression. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical utility of the repeat CT scan in clinical practice.METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of all patients who presented to our institution with mild TBI (mTBI) and isolated SAH between January 2015 and October 2017. CT scan at admission and control after 24 to 72 h were examined for each patient in order to detect any possible change. Neurological deterioration, antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, coagulopathy, SAH location, associated injuries, and length of stay in hospital were analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 649 TBI patients, 106 patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-four patients were females and 52 were males with a mean age of 68.2 years. Radiological iSAH progression was found in 2 of 106 (1.89) patients, and one of them was under antiplatelet therapy. No neurological deterioration was observed. Ten of 106 (9.4%) patients were under anticoagulation therapy, and 28 of 106 (26.4%) were under antiplatelet therapy.CONCLUSION: ISAH in mTBI seems to be a radiological stable entity over 72 h with no neurological deterioration. The clinical utility of a repeat head CT in such patients is questionable, considering its radiation exposure and cost. Regardless of anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, neurologic observation and symptomatic treatment solely could be a reasonable alternative.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: There is no high-level evidence for the time of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. The aim of this study is to assess the appropriate timing of WBRT for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases (BM).METHODS: There were 78 patients diagnosed with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BM in Beijing Chest Hospital between August 2009 and May 2015. 48 untreated patients who received both WBRT and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy. Prognostic factors of intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were identified by Cox proportional hazards modeling.RESULTS: Intracranial objective response rate was 81.3% and disease control rate was 93.8%. Median intracranial PFS was 10 months. Median OS was 18 months. Multivariate analysis of intracranial PFS revealed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1 (HR=30.436, 95%CI: 4.721-196.211, P<0.001) and early WBRT (HR=3.663, 95%CI: 1.657-8.098, P=0.001) had a better intracranial PFS. Multivariate analysis of OS revealed that PS 0-1 (HR=57.607, 95%CI: 6.135-540.953, P<0.001), early WBRT (HR=2.757, 95%CI: 1.140-6.669, P=0.024), and stereotactic radiosurgery (HR=5.964, 95%CI: 1.895-18.767, P=0.002) were independent prognostic factors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: Early WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs can improve outcomes of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BM, but it needs to be confirmed by large-sample-size and multicenter prospective clinical trials.",Excluded
494,"Stereotactic irradiation of the postoperative resection cavity for brain metastasis: a frameless linear accelerator-based case series and review of the technique. PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard of care after resection of a brain metastasis. However, concern regarding possible neurocognitive effects and the lack of survival benefit with this approach has led to the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity in place of WBRT. We report our initial experience using an image-guided linear accelerator-based frameless stereotactic system and review the technical issues in applying this technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the setup accuracy, treatment outcome, and patterns of failure of the first 18 consecutive cases treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The target volume was the resection cavity without a margin excluding the surgical track.RESULTS: The median number of brain metastases per patient was 1 (range, 1-3). The median planning target volume was 3.49 mL. The median prescribed dose was 18 Gy (range, 15-18 Gy) with normalization ranging from 68% to 85%. In all cases, 99% of the planning target volume was covered by the prescribed dose. The median conformity index was 1.6 (range, 1.41-1.92). The SRS was delivered with submillimeter accuracy. At a median follow-up of 12.7 months, local control was achieved in 16/18 cavities treated. True local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. No marginal failures occurred. Distant recurrence occurred in 6/17 patients. Median time to any failure was 7.4 months. No Grade 3 or higher toxicity was recorded. A long interval between initial cancer diagnosis and the development of brain metastasis was the only factor that trended toward a significant association with the absence of recurrence (local or distant) (log-rank p = 0.097).CONCLUSIONS: Frameless stereotactic irradiation of the resection cavity after surgery for a brain metastasis is a safe and accurate technique that offers durable local control and defers the use of WBRT in select patients.

Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party. In patients with non-metastatic but inoperable non-small cell lung cancer that is locally too extensive for radical radiotherapy (RT), but who have good performance status, it is important to determine whether thoracic RT should be the minimum that is required to palliate thoracic symptoms or whether treatment should be more intensive, with the aim of prolonging survival. A total of 509 such patients from 11 centres in the UK between November 1989 and October 1992 were admitted to a trial comparing palliative versus more intensive RT with respect to survival and quality of life. They were allocated at random to receive thoracic RT with either 17 Gy in two fractions (F2) 1 week apart (255 patients) or 39 Gy in 13 fractions (F13) 5 days per week (254 patients). Survival was better in the F13 group, the median survival periods being 7 months in the F2 group compared with 9 months in the F13 group, and the survival rates 31% and 36% at one year and 9% and 12% at 2 years, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% CI0.69-0.99). There was a suggestion of a trend towards greater benefit in fitter patients. Metastases appeared earlier in the F2 group. As recorded by patients using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the commonest symptoms on admission were cough, shortness of breath, tiredness, lack of energy, worrying and chest pain. These were more rapidly palliated by the F2 regimen. Psychological distress was generally lower in the F13 group. Three patients (two F13, one F2) exhibited evidence of myelopathy. As recorded by patients using a diary card, 76% of the F2 compared with 81% of the F13 patients had dysphagia associated with their RT. This was transient, lasting for a median of 6.5 days in the F2 group compared with 14 days in the F13 group. In conclusion, the F2 regimen had a more rapid palliative effect. In the F13 group, although treatment-related dysphagia was worse, survival was longer.",Excluded
230,"Adenosine A2A receptors are essential for long-term potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. The physiological conditions under which adenosine A2A receptors modulate synaptic transmission are presently unclear. We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.",Excluded

Method(s): All patients (Pts) underwent maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant RT 60 Gy in 30 fractions. After 2004, pts underwent chemoradiation with daily Temozolomide TMZ) (75 mg/m2) and maintenance TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 D1-D5) for a total of six cycles. An event was described as death for overall survival, progression/ recurrence of disease, or neuro-deterioration for progression free survival. Log-rank test was used to compare event-free survival (EFS) distribution. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (range-19-77). 39 patients were male and 17 patients were female with a male: female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache was the commonest symptom seen in 56.4% patients followed by seizures (53.8%) and motor deficit (12.8%).Median duration of symptoms was 8.5 months. Frontal location was most common in 66% of the patients followed by temporal and parietal location (12.5% each). 46(82.1%) patients had pure anaplastic ODG histology while 10(17.9%) patients had mixed anaplastic oligodendroglial tumor. 29(51.8%) patients underwent a gross total excision while others underwent a subtotal resection or a biopsy only.

1733,"What is the role of combined chemoradiotherapy for grade III glioma in adults?. Classification, prognosis and treatment of grade III glioma is now determined predominantly by molecular biomarkers, with 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion conferring a clear prognostic benefit and also being associated with better response to chemotherapy. The importance of this molecular biomarker is reflected in the updated WHO classification of central nervous system tumours that was published in 2016. Long term data from two large, randomised trials have shown that patients with 1p19q co-deleted anaplastic oligodendrogliomas derive significant survival benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy. More recent data from the NOA-04 study indicate that primary chemotherapy is not superior to primary radiotherapy in any molecular subgroup of anaplastic glioma and hence do not support the concept of 'delayed radiotherapy' in these patients. Despite the documented association of chemosensitivity with 1p19q co-deletion, a recent planned interim analysis of the CATNON study revealed that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas with inatct 1p19q chromosomal regions also derive significant benefit from the addition of adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. It is not yet known whether the use of temozolomide concomitant with radiotherapy confers additional benefit; these hotly anticipated data are not expected to be available for at least two years. Hence, all patients with grade III gliomas appear to benefit from both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with maximum survival benefit being achieved by 'early' rather than 'delayed' treatment. A number of questions remain, including the optimum scheduling of these treatments and the optimum radiotherapy regime for the different molecular subtypes. The question of radiation dose and volume is particularly important for this group of patients in whom long term survival can be anticipated and the risks and potential impact of neurotoxicity are significant. Strategies to reduce the long term neurocognitive impact of radiotherapy in these patients should be developed and incorporated into future clinical trials.",Excluded

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) are responsible for the functional hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We studied HCN1-4 channel mRNA and protein expression and correlated these findings with I(h) functional properties in rat DRG neurons of different size. Quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) analysis demonstrated that HCN2 and HCN1 mRNAs were more abundantly expressed in large diameter (55-80 microm) neurons, while HCN3 mRNA was preferentially expressed in small diameter (20-30 microm) neurons. HCN4 mRNA expression was very low in neurons of all sizes. At the protein level, subunit-selective polyclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence indicated that HCN1 and HCN3 are present in large diameter neurons and small diameter neurons. Staining in small diameter neurons was in IB4-positive (non-peptidergic) and IB4-negative (peptidergic) cells. HCN2 immunofluorescent staining was heterogeneous and predominantly in large diameter neurons and in small diameter IB4-negative neurons. HCN4 was poorly expressed in all neurons. Functionally, I(h) amplitude and density were significantly larger, and activation kinetics faster, in large diameter neurons when compared with small neurons. I(h) activation rates in small and large diameter DRG neurons were consistent with the relative abundance of HCN subunits in the respective cell type, considering the reported HCN channel activation rates in heterologous systems (HCN1>HCN2 approximately HCN3>HCN4), suggesting exclusivity of roles of different HCN subunits contributing to the excitability of DRG neurons of different size.

1547,"The neurophysiology of vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be induced by a wide variety of stimuli such as pregnancy, space travel, raised intracranial pressure, radiation and cytotoxic drugs. The mechanisms by which all these diverse stimuli culminate in a final common act is unknown. From studies in the 1950s a model of the emetic reflex emerged consisting of a chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema and a vomiting centre in the brain stem. This concept has been reviewed and revised in the light of recent studies. Many discussions of emesis involve detailed descriptions of the gastrointestinal events associated with the act of vomiting only - nausea and retching receiving little attention. Here we have tried to give a broader view by considering the neurophysiology of such events and have included nausea and retching, phenomena that are usually inseparable from vomiting. The possible biological function of these events is also discussed. The involvement of visceral systems (such as the heart, airways and gut) is included, and particular attention is paid to vagal mechanisms underlying the changes in gut motor activity. Emesis has long been thought to be organized by a 'vomiting centre'; the possibility that this vomiting centre could be the parvcellular reticular formation is reviewed, as is the concept that the 'centre' is larger than an anatomically defined single group of cells. The mechanism of action of two clinically relevant emetic stimuli - radiation and cytotoxic drugs - is considered in detail. Recent studies of the antiemetic properties of novel 5-HT-3 receptor antagonists against radiation and cytotoxic drug-induced vomiting are discussed; these studies suggest that important advances will be made in the treatment of emesis induced by these and other related agents.",Excluded

The effect of light and cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) on a group of identified photosensitive neurons in Helix pomatia left parietal ganglion was examined.

The reversal potential (Erev) of the light induced current (IL) and its changes due to altered extracellular concentration of potassium support the assumption that (IL) is due to suppression of K+ conductance. Elevation of intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP by adding 8-bromo-cGMP into the bathing solution or by injecting the nucleotide into the cell mimics, in all cases, the effect of light: it produces an inward current accompanied by decrement of slope conductance. The effect of elevation of cAMP was inconsistent. The I-V relations of IL and IcGMP follow a similar course and have a common Erev. The assumption that 3',5'-cyclic GMP is increased by light is also supported by comparing the effect of light and the cyclic nucleotide on the action potential.

ATM-deficient and p53-deficient fibroblasts also exhibited abnormally increased levels of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) at later intervals after irradiation. In the clonogenic assay, ATM-deficient cells exhibited marked radiosensitivity and p53-deficient cells had varying degrees of radioresistance compared with normal fibroblasts.CONCLUSION: Regardless of whether ataxia telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts are DSB-repair deficient per se, it is apparent that p53 and ATM defects greatly influence the cellular phenotype as evidenced by the neutral comet and gamma-H2AX assays. Our data suggest that the gamma-H2AX levels observed at later intervals after irradiation may represent a reliable measure of the overall DSB rejoining capabilities of human fibroblasts. However, it appears that using this parameter as a predictor of radiosensitivity without knowledge of the cells' p53 status could lead to incorrect conclusions.",Excluded
3288,"Effects of millimeter waves on ionic currents of Lymnaea neurons. The effects of mm-waves 60.22-62.22 GHz and 75 GHz on A-type K+ currents and the effects of 61.22 GHz on Ca2+ currents of Lymnaea neurons were investigated using a whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. The open end of a rectangular waveguide covered with a thin Teflon film served as a radiator. Specific absorption rates at the waveguide outlet, inserted into physiological solution, were in the range of 0-2400 W/kg. Millimeter wave irradiation increased the peak amplitudes, activation rates, and inactivation rates of both ion currents. The changes in A-type K+ current were not dependent on the irradiation frequency. It was shown that the changes in the amplitudes and kinetics of both currents resulted from the temperature rise produced by irradiation. No additional effects of irradiation on A-type K+ current other than thermal were found when tested at the phase transition temperature or in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol reduced the thermal effect of irradiation. Millimeter waves had no effect on the steady-state activation and inactivation curves, suggesting that the membrane surface charge and binding of calcium ions to the membrane in the area of channel locations did not change.",Excluded
796,"New forms of radionuclide therapy with <sup>90</sup>Y in oncology. Background: Currently, there is growing interest in the use of the beta emitter <sup>90</sup>Y in systemic therapy in oncology. For successful therapy, an appropriate ligand is chosen to carry the isotope to the place of its action. As well as performing this function, the type of the ligand influences both the course and the side effects of the treatment. For RIT of lymphomas, bone marrow becomes the critical organ; in NET patients treated with labelled somatostatin analogues, increased kidney irradiation can occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate the side effects of therapy using <sup>90</sup>Y associated with different ligands, depending on the charge to critical organs after treatment in two groups of patients: those with neuroendocrine tumours and those with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Material(s) and Method(s): 32 patients with histopathologically confirmed NET treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq/m<sup>2</sup> cumulative dose) and 30 NHL patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (1200 MBq max dose) were enrolled in the study. The kidney function and changes of blood indices were assessed during the course of the therapy. Result(s): 59% of NET patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE displayed transient reduction of blood indices, the largest after cycles III and IV of therapy. After 5 months an increase in creatinine level was noticed, but no statistically important changes in creatinine level and GFR were observed. In the group of patients with NHL, the change of haematological indices after RIT concerned mainly PLT, ANC and WBC. The reduction of the average PLT and WBC values started in the first weeks after the treatment application, reaching nadir in the 6th week and 8th week, respectively. No life threatening infections were observed in either group of patients. Conclusion(s): After treatment with the use of the <sup>90</sup>Y radionuclide, no significant treatment toxicity, including disorders involving the critical organs for both types of therapies, was found in the groups of neuroendocrine tumour and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

3003,"Novel risk stratification score for predicting early distant brain failure and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases. BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate predictors of early distant brain failure (DBF) and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases and create a clinically relevant risk score to stratify patients' risk for these events. METHODS The records of 270 patients with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. Pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. The cumulative incidences of first DBF and salvage WBRT were calculated. Significant factors were used to create a score for stratifying early (6-month) DBF risk. RESULTS No prior WBRT, a total lesion volume < 1.3 cm<sup>3</sup>, primary breast cancer or malignant melanoma histology, and multiple metastases (>=2) were found to be significant predictors of early DBF. Each factor was ascribed 1 point because of similar hazard ratios. Scores of 0 to 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were considered to indicate low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. This correlated with 6-month cumulative incidences of DBF of 16.6%, 28.8%, and 54.4%, respectively (P < .001). For patients without prior WBRT, the 6-month cumulative incidence of salvage WBRT was 2%, 17.7%, and 25.7%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Early DBF after SRS requiring salvage WBRT remains a significant clinical problem. Patient stratification for early DBF can better inform the decision for the initial treatment strategy for brain metastases. The provided risk score may help to predict early DBF and subsequent salvage WBRT if SRS is initially used. External validation is needed before clinical implementation. Cancer 2015;121:3836-3843.

65,"Orientin protects neuronal cell line from hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage via up-regulating nrf2/keap1 redox signalling pathways. Introduction: Orientin is a water-soluble flavonoid C-glycoside which is isolable from Ocimum sanctum. It has been suggested to have antioxidant, antiviral, vasodilatation, cardioprotective, radiation protective effect, neuroprotective effect and to be able to cross blood-brain-barrier. Thus, it is a potential treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Furthermore, oxidative stress has been highly implicated in the progression of ND, hence, this leads to the study on Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway for the targeted effective therapies of ND in the future. Objective(s): To determine the effects of orientin on nitric oxide levels, intracellular calcium levels and the mechanism by which orientin protects SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage. Method(s): Orientin at pre-determined maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD), 20 muM and half MNTD (O MNTD), 10muM were subjected to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h, followed by 150 muM of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> oxidative induction for 24 h at 37degreeC. The Griess assay and Fluo-4 NW calcium assay were then performed to measure the NO levels and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by a microplate reader respectively. The regulation of Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway was analysed by Western blotting. Result(s): MNTD and O MNTD significantly reduced NO levels and significantly reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by 33.49% and 28.20% when compare to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment alone. The regulation of Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway was confirmed by Western blotting.

776,"Quantitative analysis of conebeam CT for delineating stents in stent-assisted coil embolization. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Innovative techniques and device-related advances have improved the outcomes of neuroendovascular treatment. 3D imaging has previously used 2 < 2 binning, but 1 < 1 binning has recently been made available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative ability of conebeam CT for stent delineation and to investigate its effectiveness in the clinical environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four acquisition groups of 3D MIP images acquired using conebeam CT with varying conditions (acquisition time, 10 or 20 seconds and binning, 1 < 1 or 2 < 2) were compared. Two methods of analysis were performed, a phantom study and an analysis of 28 randomly selected patients. The phantom study assessed the contrast-to-noise ratio and full width at half maximum values in conebeam CT images of intracranial stent struts. In the clinical subjects, we assessed contrast-to-noise ratio, full width at half maximum, and dose-area product. RESULT(S): In the phantom study, the contrast-to-noise ratio was not considerably different between 10- and 20-second acquisition times at equivalent binning settings. Additionally, the contrast-to-noise ratio at equivalent acquisition times did not differ considerably by binning setting. For the full width at half maximum results, equivalent acquisition times differed significantly by binning setting. In the clinical analyses, the 10-second/1 < 1 group (versus 20 second/2 < 2) showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio (P .05) and a dose-area product reduced by approximately 70% (P .05), but the difference in full width at half maximum was not significant (P<.20). CONCLUSION(S): For stent-assisted coil embolization, quantitative assessment of conebeam CT showed that 10 second/1 < 1 was equivalent to 20 second/2 < 2 for imaging deployed intracranial stents. Furthermore, the 10-second/1 < 1 settings resulted in a much smaller DAP. Copyright Â© 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2485,"Sensori-neural hearing loss in patients treated with irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The present investigation has been carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the inner ear to irradiation. Cochlear function was tested in a cohort of 22 patients before and 7-84 months after receiving external irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The pre-irradiation sensori-neural hearing threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was used as a baseline for the individual patient, and the observed sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-irradiation values. The pre-irradiation hearing level or patient age was not correlated with the actual SNHL. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between the total radiation dose to the inner ear and the observed hearing impairment. SNHL was most pronounced in the high frequencies, with values up to 35 dB (4000 Hz) and 25 dB (2000 Hz) in some patients. The latent period for the complication appeared to be 12 months or more. The deleterious effect of irradiation on the hearing should be kept in mind both in treatment planning and in the follow-up after radiotherapy.",Excluded

1716,"Dim nighttime light impairs cognition and provokes depressive-like responses in a diurnal rodent. Circadian disruption is a common by-product of modern life. Although jet lag and shift work are well-documented challenges to circadian organization, many more subtle environmental changes cause circadian disruption. For example, frequent fluctuations in the timing of the sleep/wake schedule, as well as exposure to nighttime lighting, likely affect the circadian system. Most studies of these effects have focused on nocturnal rodents, which are very different from diurnal species with respect to their patterns of light exposure and the effects that light can have on their activity. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of nighttime light on behavior and the brain of a diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat. Following 3 weeks of exposure to standard light/dark (LD; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dark [0 lux]) or dim light at night (dLAN; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dim [5 lux]), rats underwent behavioral testing, and hippocampal neurons within CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) were examined. Three behavioral effects of dLAN were observed: (1) decreased preference for a sucrose solution, (2) increased latency to float in a forced swim test, and (3) impaired learning and memory in the Barnes maze. Light at night also reduced dendritic length in DG and basilar CA1 dendrites. Dendritic length in the DG positively correlated with sucrose consumption in the sucrose anhedonia task. Nighttime light exposure did not disrupt the pattern of circadian locomotor activity, and all grass rats maintained a diurnal activity pattern. Together, these data suggest that exposure to dLAN can alter affective responses and impair cognition in a diurnal animal.",Excluded
1886,"Radiotherapy and radiosurgical management of brain metastases. Out of the various cancer treatment modalities available, radiotherapy is the most commonly used for managing metastatic disease in the brain. Until recent years, this was almost exclusively limited to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Radiosurgery has emerged as a powerful technique for controlling small to moderate-sized brain metastases (<4 cm in diameter). Tumor control rates with radiosurgery are superior to those with WBRT and appear to equal or surpass those with surgery plus WBRT in most studies. The choice among various radiation management strategies (radiosurgery alone, radiosurgery plus WBRT, or surgery followed by radiotherapy) should be based on the size and location of the brain metastases, the functional and neurologic status of the patient, the type of tumor, the tumor imaging characteristics, and the patient's concerns about the risks and side effects of the proposed treatment.

1445,"Exposure of rat brain to 915 MHz GSM microwaves induces changes in gene expression but not double stranded DNA breaks or effects on chromatin conformation. We investigated whether exposure of rat brain to microwaves (MWs) of global system for mobile communication (GSM) induces DNA breaks, changes in chromatin conformation and in gene expression. An exposure installation was used based on a test mobile phone employing a GSM signal at 915 MHz, all standard modulations included, output power level in pulses 2 W, specific absorption rate (SAR) 0.4 mW/g. Rats were exposed or sham exposed to MWs during 2 h. After exposure, cell suspensions were prepared from brain samples, as well as from spleen and thymus. For analysis of gene expression patterns, total RNA was extracted from cerebellum. Changes in chromatin conformation, which are indicative of stress response and genotoxic effects, were measured by the method of anomalous viscosity time dependencies (AVTD). DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Effects of MW exposure were observed on neither conformation of chromatin nor DNA DSBs. Gene expression profiles were obtained by Affymetrix U34 GeneChips representing 8800 rat genes and analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software. In cerebellum from all exposed animals, 11 genes were upregulated in a range of 1.34-2.74 fold and one gene was downregulated 0.48-fold (P < .0025). The induced genes encode proteins with diverse functions including neurotransmitter regulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and melatonin production. The data shows that GSM MWs at 915 MHz did not induce PFGE-detectable DNA double stranded breaks or changes in chromatin conformation, but affected expression of genes in rat brain cells.",Excluded
2879,"[Role of radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma]. BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in multiple myeloma; but there are no curative options. Therefore, the treatment rationale is characterized by reduction of symptoms and inhibition of complications. Regarding reduction of pain, treatment of (impending) fractures, and spinal cord compression radiation is an important part of palliative treatment. In our retrospective study we report the effect of radiotherapy on reduction of pain, recalcification and the reduction of neurological symptoms and evaluate factors which have an impact on therapeutic outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1, Jan 1988 to 31, Dec 1998, 42 patients (19 women, 23 men; range of ages 46 to 85 years, median age 64.9 years) with 71 target volumes were irradiated (median dose 36 Gy, 2 to 3 Gy 5 times/week) because of symptomatic disease (67/71: osseous pain, 45/71: fractures/impending fractures, 13/71: spinal cord compression) (Tables 1 and 2). The median time from diagnosis to the first course of radiotherapy was 11.9 months (0.3 to 90 months). At the time of first irradiation, 5 and 37 patients were in tumor Stage II and III (Salmon/Durie), respectively. The median value of the Karnofsky performance was 70% (40 to 90%).RESULTS: During follow-up (at least 6 months) in 85% of target volumes complete and partial pain relief (measured by patients' perception and the use of analgetic medication) was achieved; recurrences were seen in 8.8%. In 26/56 (46.4%) lesions evaluable a recalcification was seen whereas 17.9% showed progressive disease (comparison of radiographs before and after radiation). In 22.3% of all lesions initially with impending fracture (4/18) radiotherapy failed because of fracture after treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Simultaneous chemotherapy and a Karnofsky performance > or = 70 had a significant impact on a positive response to treatment, respectively. Spinal cord compression symptoms were reduced in 7/13 (53.8%) of patients (scaled due to the classification by Findlay 1987). The median survival from diagnosis for the entire group was 34.9 months (7.5 to 119.3 months), after irradiation 13.1 months (0.2 to 105.3 months) (Figure 1).CONCLUSION: When adequately indicated radiotherapy has shown to be an effective palliative treatment. Taking under consideration that the results are retrospective we suppose that in multiple myeloma the local response to radiation is supported by a favorable performance status and simultaneous chemotherapy.

The overall amino acid sequence reveals characteristic elements of a RECA-like gene yet harbors an src-like phosphorylation site curiously absent from hRAD51 and hLIM15. Unlike these two relatives, hREC2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues including lung, liver, placenta, pancreas, leukocytes, colon, small intestine, brain, and heart, as well as thymus, prostate, spleen, and uterus. Of greatest interest is that hREC2 is undetectable by reverse transcription-coupled PCR in tissue culture unless the cells are treated by ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Eighty-one relapse-free patients were neurologically examined. Treatment was mastectomy (51%) or breast-conserving surgery (49%), radiotherapy to the supraclavicular +/- axilla with median 60 Gy maximum dose. Sixty-five subsequent control patients had breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy to the breast only with 55 Gy median dose. Median follow up was 10 and 7.4 years, respectively. Sixteen patients had RIBP, 7 had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 1, 4 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and 2 grade 4 RIBP. Thirty-seven patients had fibrosis and 32 had arm edema. Four patients with RIBP had no fibrosis (n = 2) or fibrosis of the axilla only (n = 2). Specificity of the question ""impaired hand functions"" for RIBP was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78); sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96). Specificity of the question ""raising the arm"" was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.9-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04-0.45); the rate of false-positive control patients was 3%. In multivariate analysis, ""impaired hand functions"" and fibrosis were independent indicators of RIBP (P <0.005). Patients with breast irradiation only stated moderate/pronounced impaired hand functions; and problems carrying weights and lifting objects from a high shelf in 38%, 58%, and 77%, not significantly different from patients with RIBP or the patients with supraclavicular radiation. RIBP is not necessarily associated with fibrosis. The aim of the questionnaire was screening of a population at risk for RIBP.

This minireview provides an overview of known and potential gender differences in physiological responses to spaceflight. The paper covers cardiovascular and exercise physiology, barophysiology and decompression sickness, renal stone risk, immunology, neurovestibular and sensorimotor function, nutrition, pharmacotherapeutics, and reproduction. Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about gender-specific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders. Individual characteristics usually outweigh gender differences per se. [References: 65]",Excluded
2490,"The cortically evoked secondary depolarization affects the integrative properties of thalamic reticular neurons. Corticothalamic terminals on thalamic reticular (RE) neurons account for most synapses from afferent pathways onto this nucleus and these inputs are more powerful than those from axon collaterals of thalamocortical neurons. Given the supremacy of cortical inputs, we analysed here the characteristics and possible mechanisms underlying a secondary component of the cortically elicited depolarization in RE neurons, recorded in cats under barbiturate anesthesia. Electrical stimulation of corticothalamic axons in the internal capsule evoked fixed and short-latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that, by increasing stimulation intensity and at hyperpolarized levels (< -70 mV), developed into low-threshold spikes and spindle oscillations. The threshold for spindle oscillations was 60% higher than that required for evoking minimal EPSPs. The evoked EPSPs included a secondary depolarizing component, which appeared approximately 5 ms after the peak of the initial component and was voltage dependent, i.e. most prominent between -70 mV and -85 mV, while being greatly reduced or absent at more hyperpolarized levels. The secondary depolarizing component was sensitive to QX-314 in the recording micropipette. We suggest that the secondary component of cortically evoked EPSPs in RE neurons is due to the dendritic activation of T-currents, with a probable contribution of the persistent Na+ current. This late component affected the integrative properties of RE neurons, including their spiking output and temporal summation of incoming cortical inputs.",Excluded
2047,"The future of intraoperative neuromonitoring in skull base surgery: Intraoperative flash visual evoked potentials a novel technique aiming to reduce the risk of intraoperative visual pathway injury. Intraoperative optic nerve/chiasmal injury is one the most devastating unexpected outcomes that may happen to patients undergoing endoscopic skull base surgery. Additionally, one of the main goals for most endoscopic skull base surgery is visual improvement, however currently there is limited ability of intraoperative monitoring for the visual pathway. We examine a novel technique which was developed in our center for monitor the visual pathway intraoperatively using continuous flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs). The FVEPs provide continuous monitoring of the visual pathway including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiation, and visual cortex, as well as retina function. This technique has been developed at the Ottawa Hospital. Intraoperatively left then right eyes were stimulated by goggle light emitting diode (LED) stimulators (3 LEDs on each side, 640 nm peak wavelength, 10 milliseconds pulse width, 3000mCd of luminous intensity was reflected back on an angle to give uniform illumination across the whole lens, which was placed over the closed eyelids, and recording was obtained from corkscrew electrodes placed at Oz-Fz (2 cm behind Fz). The stimulus rate was 1.41Hz. 150 stimulus presentations were included in a single average. The low cut filter was <=5 Hz and the high cut filter was 100 Hz with amplifier gain 20,000 or 50,000. The total sweep time was 300 milliseconds. EEG was continuously recorded during the surgery from C4-Fz. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. Also any droop in the FVEP will be examined in relation to any intraoperative events. Any transient FVEP amplitude changes which is caused by electrocautery were excluded from the analysis. Thirty patients who had endoscopic skull base surgery had intraoperative VEP using FVEPs in addition to other neurophysiologic monitoring. Patients demographic data, co-morbidities, diagnosis, surgical approach, length of surgery, MAP, and blood loss during surgery were recorded. All patients' visual acuity and field deficits were evaluated by neuro-ophthalmologist prior to their surgery and within 30 days after their surgery. Surgical anesthesia was maintained by TIVA (Propofol/remifentanil infusion). Changes in anesthetic agents and intraoperative events (e.g., sudden blood loss, use of vasopressors .etc) were timed and recorded. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. We found that FVEP is reproducible throughout surgery and can predict the postsurgical outcome. Additionally, we found that FVEP is transiently affected by different stages of surgery (e.g., traction on optic chiasm, dissection, etc.). Also we found boluses of propofol and electrocautery can artificially affect FVEP.",Excluded
277,"Stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole brain radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for patients with multiple brain metastases. PURPOSE: Multiple brain metastases are a common health problem, frequently diagnosed in patients with cancer. The prognosis, even after treatment with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), is poor with average expected survivals less than 6 months. Retrospective series of stereotactic radiosurgery have shown local control and survival benefits in case series of patients with solitary brain metastases. We hypothesized that radiosurgery plus WBRT would provide improved local brain tumor control over WBRT alone in patients with two to four brain metastases.METHODS: Patients with two to four brain metastases (all < or =25 mm diameter and known primary tumor type) were randomized to initial brain tumor management with WBRT alone (30 Gy in 12 fractions) or WBRT plus radiosurgery. Extent of extracranial cancer, tumor diameters on MRI scan, and functional status were recorded before and after initial care.RESULTS: The study was stopped at an interim evaluation at 60% accrual. Twenty-seven patients were randomized (14 to WBRT alone and 13 to WBRT plus radiosurgery). The groups were well matched to age, sex, tumor type, number of tumors, and extent of extracranial disease. The rate of local failure at 1 year was 100% after WBRT alone but only 8% in patients who had boost radiosurgery. The median time to local failure was 6 months after WBRT alone (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.5) in comparison to 36 months (95% CI, 15.6-57) after WBRT plus radiosurgery (p = 0.0005). The median time to any brain failure was improved in the radiosurgery group (p = 0.002). Tumor control did not depend on histology (p = 0.85), number of initial brain metastases (p = 0.25), or extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.26). Patients who received WBRT alone lived a median of 7.5 months, while those who received WBRT plus radiosurgery lived 11 months (p = 0.22). Survival did not depend on histology or number of tumors, but was related to extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.02). There was no neurologic or systemic morbidity related to stereotactic radiosurgery.CONCLUSIONS: Combined WBRT and radiosurgery for patients with two to four brain metastases significantly improves control of brain disease. WBRT alone does not provide lasting and effective care for most patients.",Excluded

The results confirmed the existence of circadian rhythms in the synthesis of MEL and testosterone, but revealed an inverse relationship in peak phase of these rhythms. These rhythms were disturbed after exposure to RF, with the effect being more pronounced on MEL than testosterone. The most pronounced effect of RF exposure on MEL and testosterone appears to be in rats exposed to RF at ZT 16 and ZT0 h, respectively. Data suggest that regulation of testosterone is controlled by MEL and that MEL is more sensitive to RF exposure.",Excluded

2239,"Potential biological indicators of multi-organ damage: Application to radiation accident victims. [French]. Accidental irradiations induce a complex pathological situation, difficult to assess and to treat. However, recent results describing new biological indicators of radiation-induced damages such as Flt3-ligand, citrulline and oxysterol concentration in the plasma, together with results obtained in large animal models of high dose irradiation, allowed a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms induced by uncontrolled irradiations. This conducted to leave the classical paradigm of the acute radiation syndrome, described as the association of three individual syndromes, the hematopoietic syndrome, the gastro-intestinal syndrome and the cerebrovascular syndrome, in favour of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, with the implication of other organs and systems. Follow-up of victims from two recent radiation accidents brings a confirmation of the usefulness of the newly described biological indicators, and also a partial confirmation of this new concept of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

2476,"Randomized, prospective, and controlled clinical trial of pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation for cervical fusion. Background context: Multilevel fusions, the use of allograft bone, and smoking have been associated with an increased risk of nonunion after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to increase arthrodesis rates after lumbar spine fusion surgery, but there are minimal data concerning the effect of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. Purpose(s): To determine the efficacy and safety of PEMF stimulation as an adjunct to arthrodesis after ACDF in patients with potential risk factors for nonunion. Study design: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial. Patient Sample: Three hundred and twenty-three patients with radiographic evidence (computed tomography-myelogram [CT-myelo] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of a compressed cervical nerve root and symptomatic radiculopathy appropriate to the compressed root that had failed to respond to nonoperative management were enrolled in the study. The patients were either smokers (more than one pack per day) and/or were undergoing multilevel fusions. All patients underwent ACDF using the Smith-Robinson technique. Allograft bone and an anterior cervical plate were used in all cases. Outcome measures: Measurements were obtained preoperatively and at each postoperative interval and included neurologic assessment, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for shoulder/arm pain at rest and with activity, SF-12 scores, the neck disability index (NDI), and radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension views). Two orthopedic surgeons not otherwise affiliated with the study and blinded to treatment group evaluated the radiographs, as did a blinded radiologist. Adverse events were reported by all patients throughout the study to determine device safety. Method(s): Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving PEMF stimulation after surgery (PEMF group, 163 patients) and those not receiving PEMF stimulation (control group, 160 patients). Postoperative care was otherwise identical. Follow-up was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Result(s): The PEMF and control groups were comparable with regard to age, gender, race, past medical history, smoking status, and litigation status. Both groups were also comparable in terms of baseline diagnosis (herniated disc, spondylosis, or both) and number of levels operated (one, two, three, or four). At 6 months postoperatively, the PEMF group had a significantly higher fusion rate than the control group (83.6% vs. 68.6%, p=.0065). At 12 months after surgery, the stimulated group had a fusion rate of 92.8% compared with 86.7% for the control group (p=.1129). There were no significant differences between the PEMF and control groups with regard to VAS pain scores, NDI, or SF-12 scores at 6 or 12 months. No significant differences were found in the incidence of adverse events in the groups. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized, controlled trial that analyzes the effects of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. PEMF stimulation significantly improved the fusion rate at 6 months postoperatively in patients undergoing ACDF with an allograft and an anterior cervical plate, the eligibility criteria being patients who were smokers or had undergone multilevel cervical fusion. At 12 months postoperatively, however, the fusion rate for PEMF patients was not significantly different from that of the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events in the two groups, indicating that the use of PEMF stimulation is safe in this clinical setting. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1653,"Radiotherapy of painful vertebral hemangiomas: the single center retrospective analysis of 137 cases. PURPOSE: An evaluation of dose-response relationship and an attempt to define predictive factors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 137 cases of painful vertebral hemangioma irradiations (101 patients). Fraction dose (fd) varied from 2 to 15 Gy (123 fractionated and 14 radiosurgical treatments), and total dose (TD) from 8 to 30 Gy (111 cases irradiated with fd of 2 GY to TD of 24 Gy). We evaluated pain relief, changes in analgesic requirements, and reossification.RESULTS: Means of pain relief 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after radiotherapy (defined as a decrease of primary pain level expressed in percent) were 60.5%, 65.4%, 68.3%, and 78.4%, respectively. Proportion of patients with no need for analgesics and patients using tramadol were 39%, 40%, 44%, 57%, and 20%, 17%, 22%, and 11% in these times. The proportion of patients experiencing complete/partial pain relief changed from 36/48% 1 month, to 64/22% 1.5 years after radiotherapy. No impact of radiotherapy on reossification was found. The positive impact of fd and TD increase for analgesics uptake reduction and pain relief was found. An increase of the fd by 1 Gy results in 27% chance of analgesics uptake reduction and 3.8% reduction of pain, whereas 14% analgesics uptake reduction and 2.2% of pain reduction in case of the TD. The predictive factors improving results were found: female gender, older age, better performance states (the chance of the lower analgesic treatment decreases over 2.5 times in comparison to the higher Zubrod degree), bigger Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data support the efficacy of radiotherapy in improving pain secondary to vertebral hemangioma, with the degree of pain amelioration being related to increasing fd and TD. The positive predictive factors were defined: female gender, older age, better performance status, increased Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration, and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.",Excluded
3400,"Neural tracts injuries in patients with hypoxic ischemic brain injury: Diffusion tensor imaging study. Many studies have reported on vulnerable areas of the brain in hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HI-BI). However, little is known about the involvement of neural tracts following HI-BI. We investigated neural tract injuries in adult patients with HI-BI, using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Twelve consecutive patients with HI-BI and 12 control subjects were recruited for this study. We classified the patients into two subgroups according to the preservation of alertness: subgroup A-5 patients who had intact alertness and subgroup B-7 patients who had impaired alertness. DTI-Studio software was used for evaluation of seven neural tracts: corticospinal, cingulum, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and optic radiation. We measured the DTT parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient and voxel number) of each neural tract. In the individual analysis, all 12 patients showed injuries in all 24 neural tracts in terms of both DTT parameters and integrity, except for the corticospinal tract (75.0% injury). In the group analysis, the patient group showed neural injuries in all 24 neural tracts. In comparison of subgroups A and B, subgroup B showed more severe injuries: subgroup B showed a higher rate of disruption (39.8%) than subgroup A (12.9%) on individual DTTs and subgroup B had more severe injuries in both the cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. In conclusion, we found that extensive injuries in the neural tracts were accompanied by HI-BI. Patients with impaired alertness appeared to show more severe injuries of neural tracts.

173,"Inhibition of IKK/NF-kappaB impairs glioma stem cell function. Glioma, the most frequently occurring primary brain tumor, has a median survival of less than 15 months, despite multimodal treatment combining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. It has been suggested that the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within these tumors are responsible for resistance to treatment and high probability of recurrence. As a result, there is increasing interest in specifically targeting CSCs with new therapies to improve treatment of this disease. NF-kappaB has been implicated in numerous forms of cancer, as its target genes regulate hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Both glioma cell lines and tumor samples show high levels of phosphorylated p65, a marker of NF-kappaB activation. When comparing populations from tumor explants, NF-kappaB is preferentially activated in the CSC subset. We are examining the effects of IKK/NF-kappaB inhibition on both heterogeneous glioma explants and purified (CD133+) CSCs from these explants. Inhibition of NF-kappaB through either genetic or pharmacological means abrogates neurosphere formation, an in vitro measure of stem cell function. Additionally, real-time PCR analysis indicates that inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to a decrease in target genes implicated in glioma CSC biology, such as A20 and IL-6. We have also studied our glioma explants in both subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts to examine the role of NF-kappaB in vivo. We are utilizing microarrays to define the NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression signature in CD133+ cells. Our studies indicate a significant role for the NF-kappaB pathway in the biology of glioma CSCs, with possible parallels in CSCs of other tumor types.",Excluded
2545,"Disinhibited in vitro neocortical slices containing experimentally induced cortical dysplasia demonstrate hyperexcitability. Cortical dysplasia, a disorder of neuronal migration, has a strong association with intractable epilepsy in humans but little is known about the physiologic abnormalities that are present in this condition. Fetal rats were exposed to external irradiation to experimentally produce diffuse cortical dysplasia. In vitro neocortical slices from adult irradiated and control animals were examined in physiologic solution and in the presence of the A-type gamma-amino butyric acid (GABAA) receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide. Epileptiform bursts were quantified by counting the number of negative field potentials per epileptiform event. In the presence of bicuculline, neocortical slices with cortical dysplasia demonstrated more robust epileptiform activity in the form of an increased number of negative field potentials per epileptiform event. This demonstrates that areas of experimentally induced cortical dysplasia possess an inherent hyperexcitability when GABAA-mediated inhibition is effectively blocked.",Excluded

401,"Establishment and characterization of a chemoresistant glioblastoma cell line from an Iraqi patient. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumour in humans, and has a very poor prognosis. As it is a well known fact that environmental factors especially radiation exposure is a major risk for glioblastoma multiforme and Iraq had been exposed in a relatively short period to 2 international wars with documented radiation exposure, so this paper might give justification for establishment of a new glioblastoma cell line. This cell line has been established from a cerebral glioblastoma multiforme in a 72-year-old Iraqi man who underwent surgery for an intracranial tumour in 2005. The morphology, growth kinetics, karyotype, immunocytochemistry and angiogenesis factor expression profile of this ANGM5 cell line were studied. The cell line has been grown continuously for more than 200 serial passages in standard culture media presenting no sign of cell senescence. The cultured cells are elongated or multipolar in shape and the population doubling time is 28 hours. The karyotype is complex and the chromosomal number varied between 46 and 48. The cell line is resistant to Temozolomide, cisplatin, vincristine and etoposide. This chemoresistance could be explained by the overexpression of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which found to be overexpressed by this cell line. Immunocytochemistry also showed that this cell line exhibited several characteristic features of glioblastomas, analysis of glial markers demonstrated that cells are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and negative for nestin and calbindin. Protein microarray analysis showed very high production of TIMP2 as well as other factors that are important for the invasiveness and aggressiveness of glioblastoma. This glioblastoma cell line is a useful addition to the cell lines currently available for study of the pathobiology and chemoresistance properties of glioblastoma multiforme as well as for antitumour drug discovery.",Excluded
1361,"Effects of scatter and attenuation correction on quantitative analysis of beta-CIT brain SPET. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of scatter correction (SC) and attenuation correction (AC) on the quantification of dopamine transporters using (123)I-beta-CIT brain SPET images. Quantitative analysis was carried out using static SPET images obtained 23 h after injection. We calculated V<inf>3</inf>'' [(striatal - occipital)/occipital ratio] values from images without correction, with AC, and with SC and AC. Two types of regions of interest (ROI) were placed on the striatum: a small square ROI and a larger ROI containing most of the striatum. After validating the correction method in a phantom experiment, a human study was carried out involving eight normal volunteers and 15 patients. The larger ROI yielded smaller V<inf>3</inf>'' values. The effect of attenuation correction was modest, whereas that of scatter correction was marked. It was shown that beta-CIT SPET quantification was affected by the size of the ROI, photon scattering and attenuation, and that scatter and attenuation correction improved the accuracy of the quantification. Methodological standardization in image processing and the type of ROI should be considered when a multi-centre trial is planned.",Excluded
3455,"[Molecular and cellular mechanisms of late radiation injuries]. Late radiation damages arise more often in nonproliferating or slow proliferating tissues after local irradiation in large (intolerable) doses of ionizing radiation. Obviously the late radiation effects are induced by radiation damages to capillaries and disturbances of microcirculation in tissues. This is a basis for tissue hypoxia, ""oxidative stress"" and loss of parenchyma cells. The direct radiation effect on parenchyma cells has as a rule little importance for production of late radiation damages. Other type of late radiation damages can be discovered after sublethal irradiation of whole body. This is a cause of decrease of life span. In this case the important factors are also damages of vessels, disturbances in microcirculation and loss of parenchyma cells in ""target"" organs especially in neuroendocrine and immune systems. The new data on the possibility to decrease the late radiation damages after local or whole body irradiation using postradiation treatment with pulsed electric field (PEF) are considered. Mechanisms of PEF effects are explained in terms of its ability to induce nitric oxide production which causes intensification of blood microcirculation, as well as increase in SOD production and activity of repair enzymes.

Photobiomodulation using low-level light-emitting diode can be rapidly applied in neurological and physiological disorders safely and noninvasively. Photobiomodulation is effective for chronic diseases because of fewer side effects than drugs. Here we investigated the effects of photobiomodulation using light-emitting diode on amyloid plaques, gliosis, and neuronal loss to prevent and/or recover cognitive impairment, and optimal timing of photobiomodulation initiation for recovering cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 5XFAD mice were used as an Alzheimer's disease model. Animals receiving photobiomodulation treatment were divided into two groups: an early group starting photobiomodulation at 2 months of age (5XFAD+Early), and a late group starting photobiomodulation at 6 months of age (5XFAD+Delay). Both groups received photobiomodulation 20 minutes per session three times per week for 14 weeks. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 10 months of age. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed after behavioral evaluation. The results showed that photobiomodulation treatment at early stages reduced amyloid accumulation, neuronal loss, and microgliosis and alleviated the cognitive dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, possibly by increasing insulin degrading enzyme related to amyloid-beta degradation. Photobiomodulation may be an excellent candidate for advanced preclinical Alzheimer's disease research.",Excluded
709,"Vertebrate ancient opsin photopigment spectra and the avian photoperiodic response. In mammals, photoreception is restricted to cones, rods and a subset of retinal ganglion cells. By contrast, non-mammalian vertebrates possess many extraocular photoreceptors but in many cases the role of these photoreceptors and their underlying photopigments is unknown. In birds, deep brain photoreceptors have been shown to sense photic changes in daylength (photoperiod) and mediate seasonal reproduction. Nonetheless, the specific identity of the opsin photopigment 'sensor' involved has remained elusive. Previously, we showed that vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin is expressed in avian hypothalamic neurons and forms a photosensitive molecule. However, a direct functional link between VA opsin and the regulation of seasonal biology was absent. Here, we report the in vivo and in vitro absorption spectra (lambda<inf>max</inf>=~490 nm) for chicken VA photopigments. Furthermore, the spectral sensitivity of these photopigments match the peak absorbance of the avian photoperiodic response (lambda<inf>max</inf>=492 nm) and permits maximum photon capture within the restricted light environment of the hypothalamus. Such a correspondence argues strongly that VA opsin plays a key role in regulating seasonal reproduction in birds. Â© 2011 The Royal Society.",Excluded

We here evaluated the palliative effect of EBRT for HCC bone metastases and compared the dose-response relationship between multiple fractions (MFs) and an 8-Gy single fraction (SF). Twenty-eight patients (42 sites) with painful bone metastases who received EBRT and were analyzed retrospectively. Eight patients (12 sites) received SF.

Objectives: Evaluating the effect of ionizing radiation and temozolomide, alone or associated, on the expression of the miRNAs miR-15, miR-16 and miR-21 in neurospheres and adhered cells in glioblastoma cell line (U343-MG). Method(s): The trypan blue was used to examine cell viability before and after treatment, and real time PCR to analyze the expression of microRNAs in time 0h (immediately after treatments), and 48h after the exposure to treatments. Result(s): The analysis of cell viability showed no statistically significant difference among the studied groups. The oncogene miR-21 demonstrated a significantly higher expression in neurospheres in group treated with ionizing radiation (both 0h and 48h). The tumor suppressors microRNAs miR-15 and miR-16 had no significant expression among cell types and treatments modalities submissions. However, miR-15 and miR-16 had a considerably different expression between the analyzed periods: miR-15 in the time 0h was highly expressed in adherent cells treated with ionizing radiation and temozolomide; and, during the 48 hour analysis, miR-15 was more expressed in neurospheres with the same type of treatment. The same expression profile happened with the miR-16, however being more expressed in the group treated with ionizing radiation.

The activities of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism--phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PE N-MTase)--were found to be differently affected by pre-incubation of rod outer segments (ROS) under protein phosphorylating or dephosphorylating conditions. Exposure to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), under dark or light conditions, produced a significant increase in PE N-MTase activity, whereas PLA2 activity decreased. Under standard protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylating conditions in light, PE N-MTase activity was stimulated and PLA2 activity was not affected. When the assays were performed in the dark, both enzymatic activities were unaffected when compared to the corresponding controls. Incubation of ROS membranes in light in the presence of PKC activators phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) resulted in the same pattern of changes in enzyme activities as described for standard PKC phosphorylating condition. Pre-incubation of membranes with the PKC inhibitor H-7 reduced the stimulation of PDBu on PE N-MTase activity, and had no effect on PLA2 activity in ROS membranes incubated with the phorbol ester. Pre-treatment of isolated ROS with alkaline phosphatase resulted in decreased PE N-MTase activity and produced a significant stimulation of PLA2 activity under dark as well as under light conditions when compared to the corresponding controls. These findings suggest that ROS protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation modulates PE N-MTase and PLA2 activities in isolated ROS, and that these activities are independently and specifically modulated by particular kinases. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of ROS proteins has the opposite effect to that produced by protein phosphorylation on the enzymes studied.",Excluded
200,"Neuroendocrine asymmetry. The information available at present clearly indicates that asymmetry exists from the level of elementary particles to the human cerebral cortex, the latest stage of evolution. Cerebral lateralization is one of the well-known asymmetries. This paper summarizes the data published in the past decades on the asymmetry of the neuroendocrine system. The information on the sided-differences between the gonads, adrenals, and thyroid lobes and that on the lateralization of hypothalamic, limbic, and other brain structures participating in the control of the endocrine glands as well as relevant clinical observations are reviewed here. The innervation of the peripheral endocrine glands is also briefly summarized because the afferent and efferent fibers of these glands may represent one part of the pathway involved in neuroendocrine asymmetry. The data reviewed clearly indicate that some kind of asymmetry (morphological, biochemical, physiological, pathological) is evident at different levels of the neuroendocrine system (at limbic, hypothalamic, peripheral endocrine glands and their innervation) and there are species, sex, and age differences. Most of the information accumulated deals with the CNS-gonadal system. A majority of the observations suggest that in both male and female rats there is a predominance of the right half of brain structures controlling gonadal function. The asymmetry, however, is not restricted to CNS structures: it also exists at the level of the gonads, including their innervation. It appears that the characteristic pattern of the CNS-gonadal system becomes fixed only after sexual maturation. Very few reports are available suggesting some kind of asymmetry of the CNS-adrenal cortex and the CNS-thyroid system. There are convincing findings consistent with the view that in addition to the hypothalamo-adenohypophyseal system acting via the general circulation on the peripheral endocrine glands, there is also a pure neural link between the CNS and the gonads, the CNS and the adrenal gland, and also between the CNS and the thyroid. This link contains afferent and efferent pathways and is able to modulate the functional activity or the responsiveness of the gland. It may also serve as a neural reflex arc. It is assumed that the neuroendocrine asymmetry expresses itself through (i) hypophysiotrophic neurohormones and hormones of the peripheral endocrine glands, (ii) neural pathways, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). The authors hope that this publication, in addition to providing an overview, will also stimulate research, both basic and clinical, in this exciting area of neuroendocrinology.

Background: Mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) occurs in > 70% of WHO grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). The mutant enzyme catalyze the reduction of a-ketoglutaric acid to D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, leading to cancer initiation. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of SYC-435 (1-hydroxypyridin-2-one), a newly developed mutant IDH1inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo in IDH1 mutant gliomas as compared with IDH1 wild type GBMs. Method(s): An established neurosphere line (BT142) of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), and a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of recurrent AOA (ICV0914AOA), and 2 PDOX models of GBM (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) were included. IDH1 mutations (R132H and R132C) were analyzed by pyrosequencing. To determine the in vitro antitumor activities, tumor cells were exposed to SYC-435 (0.02 to 20 [iM) and examining for changes of cell proliferation every 3-4 days till day 13 by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. For in vivo effects, orthotopic xenograft mouse models of IC-BT142AOA and IC-V0914AOA were treated with vehicle (as control), SYC-435 (i.p., 15 mg/kg/day x 28 days), temozolomide (TMZ, oral, 50 mg/kg/day x 5 days) + fractionated radiation (XRT, 2 Gy/day x 5 days) (as standard therapy), and combination of SYC-435 with standard therapy starting 2 weeks after intracranial tumor implantation. Animal survival times were analyzed by log rank analysis. Result(s): IDH1 R132H mutation (homozygous) was detected in BT142AOA neurosphere line and R132C mutation (mutant allele frequency 39-42%) in IC-V0914AOA xenograft cells, while the two GBM models (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) carried wild-type IDH1. Suppression of cell growth was observed in time- and dosedependent manner by SYC-435, particularly at the IDH1 mutant models. At 0.5 ^M, SYC-435 inhibited cell growth by 90% in BT142 and 60% in IC-V0914AOA cells, whereas in IDH wild-type GBMs only by 17% in IC-4687GBM and 19% in IC-3752GBM cells at day 13, indicating the high selectivity of SYC-435 of mutant over wild type IDH1. Systematic in vivo treatment with SYC-435 alone did not alter survival times in neither IC-BT142AOA nor IC-V0914AOA models when compared with the control group. Although standard therapy significantly prolonged animal survival times in both models (P<0.0005), combining SYC-435 with standard therapies further extended the median survival times from 106 days (in the standard therapy group) to 124 days (P<0.05) in IC-V0914AOA and exhibited similar trend in IC-BT142AOA.

CEP-1347 (KT7515), an indolocarbazole of the K252a family, blocks this stress signaling cascade and promotes survival. Here, we used CEP-1347 to probe whether neuronal death pathways activated by distinct insults also possess elements in common. Cultured rat sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were induced to die by withdrawal of nerve growth factor, exposure to ultraviolet irradiation, or subjection to oxidative stress. In each case, death was prevented by 100-200 nM CEP-1347. Moreover, in each of these death paradigms, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activity in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells was elevated by two- or threefold, and this increase was totally blocked by CEP-1347 at concentrations that promoted survival. In contrast, 200 nM CEP-1347 did not block death due to serum withdrawal from undifferentiated PC12 cells or to activation of Fas in Jurkat T cell cultures, even though in each case c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activation occurred and was inhibited by CEP-1347. These observations suggest that some but not all death pathways triggered by different insults can include a common mechanistic component, a likely candidate for which is activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade.",Excluded

Radiation attenuation was measured using corresponding mean Hounsfield units for TAMA. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as body mass index above 25 kg.m-2 combined with skeletal muscle mass index below the sex-specific median. Postoperative complications were graded by using the -Clavien-Dindo classification.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (25.3%) developed a grade 3-5 complication. Lower radiation attenuation was independently associated with overall (p = 0.003) and grade 3-5 complications (p = 0.002). Sarcopenic obesity was associated with overall complications (all p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle measurements and survival were not significantly related.CONCLUSION: Radiation attenuation was associated with overall and grade 3-5 postoperative morbidity after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and non-laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with overall complications.",Excluded
3306,"Field sensitivity action spectra of cone photoreceptors in the turtle retina. 1. The Stiles two-colour increment threshold technique was applied to turtle cone photoreceptors in order to derive their field sensitivity action spectra. 2. Photoresponses of cone photoreceptors were recorded intracellularly. Flash sensitivities were calculated from small amplitude (< 1 mV) responses. The desensitizing effects of backgrounds of different wavelengths were measured and the background irradiance needed to desensitize the cone by a factor of 10 (1 log unit) was defined as threshold. The reciprocals of these thresholds were used to construct the field sensitivity action spectrum. 3. The field sensitivity action spectra of long-wavelength-sensitive (L) and medium-wavelength-sensitive (M) cones depended upon the wavelength of the test flash used to measure them. This excludes the possibility that turtle cones can function as single-colour mechanisms in the Stiles sense. 4. In fourteen L-cones, the average wavelength of peak sensitivity of the field sensitivity action spectrum was 613.7 +/- 7.7 nm for the 500 nm test and 635.6 +/- 9.6 nm for the 700 nm test. For six M-cones, these values were 558.5 +/- 6.8 and 628.8 +/- 10.6 nm for the 500 and 700 nm tests, respectively. 5. Two physiological mechanisms are suggested as contributing to the dependency of the field sensitivity action spectrum upon test wavelength. One is based upon the transmissivity properties of the coloured oil droplets, while the other hypothesizes excitatory interactions between cones of different spectral type. 6. Computer simulations of the field sensitivity action spectra indicate that both mechanisms are needed in order to account for the dependency of the field sensitivity action spectrum upon the wavelength of the test flash.",Excluded

Twenty-seven advanced ovarian carcinoma patients who had received six courses of cyclophosphamide/cisplatin and had either microscopic disease (15 patients) or no pathologically detectable disease (12 patients) after second-look laparotomy were treated with abdominopelvic radiation (2250 cGy to the abdomen and pelvis and a 2250-cGy pelvic boost). Acute myelosuppression or gastrointestinal toxicity prevented completion of treatment in only three patients. However, bowel obstruction occurred in 13 (48%), ten of whom required surgery. Five of these ten had recurrent tumor, but the other five did not. Subsequently two of the latter five did develop a recurrence, one in the lung and one in the liver. A third patient died as an indirect result of radiation damage to the bowel. Median follow-up duration is 17 months from completion of radiation. So far, 13 (48%) have developed progressive disease: four (33%) of the 12 who had a negative second-look laparotomy and nine (60%) of the 15 who had microscopic disease before radiation. While acute toxicity is tolerable, the incidence of serious chronic bowel toxicity is high. Efforts should be made to alter this therapy in order to decrease the frequency of long-term morbidity.",Excluded
2809,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B. INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors.",Excluded
1557,"High-dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM. Purpose/Objective(s): Ascorbate is a water soluble vitamin that has been previously shown at milli-molar concentrations to be selectively toxic to a variety of cancer cells, including high grade gliomas, while being innocuous to normal cells. In addition, in vivo experiments with human xenografts and human clinical trials with pancreas cancer demonstrated that high plasma concentrations of ascorbate (~20 mM) are well tolerated. Since ascorbate crosses the blood brain barrier, we hypothesized that high dose ascorbate would enhance chemo-radio-sensitization in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials/Methods: In order to determine if high dose ascorbate enhances GBM chemo-radio-sensitization, U87 and UI-581 human GBM cells were grown in vitro for 24 hrs and then exposed to 0.5 mM ascorbate and/or temozolomide 100 mmol/L for 1 hr followed by 2 Gy of concurrent irradiation. In the xenograft studies, U87 GBM cells were grown in the flanks of nude mice and treated with ascorbate (4 mg/kg; IP), and/or ionizing radiation (6 Gy x 2 fractions 48hrs apart) for 2 weeks. Tumor growth rates were assessed daily with calipers. Result(s): Both U87 and UI 581 cell lines demonstrated that ascorbate has an additive effect on radiation+temozolomide-induced cell killing in clonogenic cell survival analysis (p<0.05). In addition, ascorbate toxicity was completely inhibited (p<0.05) with the addition of catalase confirming that ascorbate toxicity is mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Mice with U87 GBM xenograft tumors treated with ascorbate and radiation demonstrated a significantly slower tumor growth rate compared to mice receiving radiation alone (p=0.031). Median survival in mice treated with radiation alone was 21 days while mice treated with ascorbate plus radiation was 28 days (p = 0.034). Conclusion(s): These experiments support the hypothesis that high dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM.",Excluded
3106,"Total-body PET: Maximizing sensitivity to create new opportunities for clinical research and patient care. PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.

1867,"3D cerebral angiography: radiation dose comparison with digital subtraction angiography. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As the use of 3D rotational angiography (3D RA) for the evaluation of cerebral vasculature becomes more widespread, it is important to evaluate this imaging method's effect on patient radiation dose. The purpose of the study is to measure 3D RA radiation dose as compared with biplanar digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHOD(S): The distribution and peak skin dose were measured for 3D RA and biplanar DSA by using an anthropomorphic skull phantom. In addition, the cumulative incident dose, summed over all images in each acquisition, was determined. Measurements were acquired for our facility's standard 3D RA acquisition mode (25 degrees /s rotational speed; 162 total frames) and other available acquisition mode selections. RESULT(S): For 3D RA, the skin dose was found to be distributed across the back and sides of the skull with the peak skin dose located at the center of the back of the skull. The peak skin dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 15 mGy. For a biplanar DSA run, the peak skin dose was 58 mGy, also located at the back of the skull. The cumulative incident dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 33 mGy, compared with 53 mGy for biplanar DSA. CONCLUSION(S): The patient radiation dose for 3D RA is significantly lower than for biplanar DSA, by nearly a factor of 4 in peak skin dose and 40% lower in cumulative incident dose.",Excluded
355,"Encoding of stimulus frequency and sensor motion in the posterior medial thalamic nucleus. In all sensory systems, information is processed along several parallel streams. In the vibrissa-to-barrel cortex system, these include the lemniscal system and the lesser-known paralemniscal system. The posterior medial nucleus (POm) is the thalamic structure associated with the latter pathway. Previous studies suggested that POm response latencies are positively correlated with stimulation frequency and negatively correlated with response duration, providing a basis for a phase locked loop-temporal decoding of stimulus frequency. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing response latencies of POm neurons, in both awake and anesthetized rats, to vibrissae deflections at frequencies between 0.3 and 11 Hz. We found no significant, systematic correlation between stimulation frequency and the latency or duration of POm responses. We obtained similar findings from recording in awake rats, in rats under different anesthetics, and in anesthetized rats in which the reticular activating system was stimulated. These findings suggest that stimulus frequency is not reliably reflected in response latency of POm neurons. We also tested the hypothesis that POm neurons respond preferentially to sensor motion, that is, they respond to whisking in air, without contacts. We recorded from awake, head-restrained rats while monitoring vibrissae movements. All POm neurons responded to passive whisker deflections, but none responded to noncontact whisking. Thus like their counterparts in the trigeminal ganglion, POm neurons may not reliably encode whisking kinematics. These observations suggest that POm neurons might not faithfully encode vibrissae inputs to provide reliable information on vibrissae movements or contacts.",Excluded
859,"High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue as initial therapy for anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Purpose: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a chemosensitive glial neoplasm. To improve disease control and postpone cranial radiotherapy, we designed a phase II study of intensive procarbazine, lomunstine and vincristine followed by high-dose thiotepa with autologous stem cell rescue for patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic or aggressive oligodendroglioma. Patients and Methods: Sixty-nine patients with a median age of 42 (range: 18-67) and a median Karnofsky Performance Score of 90 (range: 70-100) were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a prior diagnosis of low-grade oligodendroglioma and 16 had mixed oligoastrocytoma pathology. Only patients with demonstrably chemosensitive enhancing tumors or those free of enhancing tumor after surgery and induction therapy were eligible to receive high-dose thiotepa. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients (57%) completed the transplant regimen; their estimated median progression-free survival is 69 months and median overall survival has not been reached. Twelve transplanted patients (31 %) relapsed. Neither histology nor prior low-grade oligodendroglioma correlated with relapse; however, persistent non-enhancing tumor at transplant conferred an increased risk of relapse (p = 0.028). The transplant regimen was well-tolerated; median hospital stay was 20 days (range: 7-43) with a median time to ANC and platelet engraftment of 10 days. Thirty patients (43%) did not receive high-dose thiotepa because of stable or progressive disease (n = 21), excessive toxicity (n = 4), refusal of further therapy (n = 2), failure to obtain insurance coverage (n = 2), or other (n - 1). No treatment-related or long-term neurotoxicity was seen in the transplanted patients.

634,"Relapse in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma after treatment with 3F8+GM-CSF+CIS-retinoic acid in first complete/very good partial remission: Patterns, management and long-term outcome. Background/Objectives: Anti-GD2 immunotherapy is now standard of care for high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB). However, prognosis after first relapse post-immunotherapy is deemed dismal; patients are often enrolled on early phase studies without curative intent. Design/Methods: HR-NB patients relapsing post-3F8+GMCSF+cis-retinoic acid (CRA) in first complete (CR) or very good partial remission (VGPR) (NCT00072358) underwent the following reinduction strategies: (1) Isolated CNS relapse (CNS-R): multimodality therapy including intra-Ommaya radioimmunotherapy (MM-RIT) (J Neurooncol 97:409). (2) Disseminated (D-R) or focal soft-tissue relapse (FS-R): High-dose chemotherapy using active agents as previously described (Cancer 119: 665; Bone Marrow Transplant 48:642; Pediatr Blood Cancer 56: 403; Eur J Cancer 47: 84; Cancer 116: 3054) +/-surgery (+/-IORT)+/-radiation. (3) Focal bone relapse (FB-R): low-dose chemotherapy (J Clin Oncol 24:5271) +/- radiation. Patients achieving second CR/VGPR were retreated with 3F8+GM+CRA (Oncoimmunol In Press 2015) +/-anti-GD2/GD3 humoral vaccine (ClinCanRes 20:1375). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) analyses were performed (Kaplan-Maier method) and prognostic variables compared (log-rank test). Result(s): Of 145 consecutive patients treated with 3F8+GM+CRA in first CR/VGPR, 64 (44%) relapsed (median follow-up 60 months from starting 3F8): 17 CNS-R, 24 D-R, 12 FS-R, 11 FB-R. 39 (61%) achieved second CR. 19 (29%) continued in remission >5 years after relapse. Respective five-year PFS and OS rates (%) for groups CNS-R receiving MM-RIT, D-R, FS-R and FB-R were 77+/-12 and 68+/-13, 6+/-7 and 6+/-7, 25+/-13 and 30+/-7, 54+/-15 and 62+/-15. Adverse prognostic factors for survival post-relapse included failure to achieve second CR, D-R as opposed to other relapse patterns, and early (<6mo from starting 3F8 ) relapse (p<0.05 for each), but not MYCN amplification (p=0.4). Conclusion(s): Long-term PFS and OS are possible in HR-NB patients post-relapse if CR/VGPR can be achieved, especially when relapse is focal. Agents with proven anti-NB activity should be considered initially at first relapse rather than purely experimental approaches.",Excluded

PURPOSE: For the treatment of localized prostate cancer, focal therapy has the potential to cure with fewer side effects than traditional whole-gland treatments. We report an update on toxicity, quality of life (QoL), and tumor control in our magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy cohort.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Disease status was evaluated by systematic biopsies and 3T multiparametric MRI. The brachytherapy implant procedure under fused transrectal ultrasound/MRI guidance was followed by a 1.5 T MRI for contour adjustments and catheter position verification. A single dose of 19 Gy was delivered to the tumor with a margin of 5 mm. Genitourinary (GU) toxicity, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, and erectile dysfunction (ED) were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. QoL was measured with RAND-36, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and PR25. International Prostate Symptom Scores and International Index of Erectile Function scores were obtained. Prostate-specific antigen level was monitored, with biochemical recurrence defined as nadir + 2 ng/mL (Phoenix).RESULTS: Thirty patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low- (13%) to intermediate-risk (87%) prostate cancer were treated between May 2013 and April 2016. Median follow-up was 4 years. Median age was 71 years (interquartile range, 68-73) and median initial prostate-specific antigen level was 7.3 ng/mL (5.2-8.1). Maximum Gleason score was 4 + 3 = 7 (in 2 patients). All tumors were radiologic (MRI) stage T2. No grade >2 GU or >1 GI toxicity occurred. International Prostate Symptom Scores only deteriorated temporarily. Mild pretreatment ED deteriorated to moderate/severe ED in 50% of patients. Long-term clinically relevant QoL deterioration was seen in sexual activity and tiredness, whereas emotional and cognitive functioning improved. At 4 years, biochemical disease-free survival was 70% (95% confidence interval, 52%-93%), metastases-free survival was 93% (85%-100%), and overall survival was 100%. Of intraprostatic recurrences, 7 of 9 were out of field.CONCLUSIONS: Ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy conveys minimal GU or GI toxicity and has a marginal effect on QoL. An early decline in erectile function was seen. Tumor control outcomes are poor (biochemical disease-free survival of 70% [52%-93%] at 4 years), most likely as a result of poor patient selection.",Excluded
1319,"The application of magnets directs the orientation of neurite outgrowth in cultured human neuronal cells. Electric and magnetic fields have been known to influence cellular behavior. In the present study, we hypothesized that the application of static magnetic fields to neurons will cause neurites to grow in a specific direction. In cultured human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells or PC12 cells, neurite outgrowth was induced by forskolin, retinoic acid, or nerve growth factor (NGF). We applied static magnetic fields to the neurons and analyzed the direction and morphology of newly formed neuronal processes. In the presence of the magnetic field, neurites grew in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, as revealed by the higher orientation index of neurites grown under the magnetic field compared to that of the neurites grown in the absence of the magnetic field. The neurites parallel to the magnetic field appeared to be dystrophic, beaded or thickened, suggesting that they would hinder further elongation processes. The co-localized areas of microtubules and actin filaments were arranged into the vertical axis to the magnetic field, while the levels of neurofilament and synaptotagmin were not altered. Our results suggest that the application of magnetic field can be used to modulate the orientation and direction of neurite formation in cultured human neuronal cells.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE(S): To help clinicians in decision making for treatment of asymptomatic meningiomas. METHOD(S): A single center retrospective cohort study of 117 patients with 122 tumors treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS; Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Patients were followed with longitudinal imaging and clinical evaluations. Tumor volumetry and developments of new signs or symptoms after GKRS were the end points in the study. RESULT(S): Median patient age at GKRS was 60 yr (range 21-86 yr) with a median clinical follow-up of 53 mo (range 20-252 mo). The median pre-GKRS tumor volume was 3.6 +/- 3.8 cc (+/-standard deviation). Tumors were treated with a median margin dose of 14 +/- 2 Gy. At last follow-up, median tumor volume was 2.5 +/- 3.6 cc. Radiological progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 97% and 94.4% at 5 yr and 10 yr, respectively. Clinical PFS rates were 86% and 70% at 5 yr and 10 yr, respectively.

923,"Epworth Sleepiness Scale-a novel tool to assess somnolence syndrome post radiotherapy to brain. Introduction: Radiation to brain causes early, early-delayed and delayed side effects.1 Although early and delayed effects are well studied, there is paucity of literature regarding early-delayed effects like somnolence syndrome. The existing studies use general symptom assessment and visual analog scales.2 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a time tested tool to assess daytime sleepiness in various conditions.3 This study is an attempt to determine the presence of somnolence in our patients using this novel scale. It is a simple questionnaire and we expect this will be able to grade the severity of somnolence. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine post radiation somnolence using Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective(s): To study the incidence of somnolence syndrome in patients receiving radiotherapy to brain. Material(s) and Method(s): 23 patients with primary brain tumor or metastases to brain were the subjects of the study. Patient demographics and tumor type- primary or metastatic along with grade was noted. Patients with Karnofsky performance status less than 70 and those with pre-existing sleep disorders were excluded from the study. Patients were treated with palliative whole brain radiation for brain metastases and conformal adjuvant radiotherapy for primary brain tumors as per standard guidelines. Patients were subjected to Epworth Sleepiness Scale3 at baseline, thereafter every week during radiation; also continuing weekly after cessation of radiation until 6 weeks post treatment. Result(s): All 23 patients (median age 50 years) completed the planned questionnaires until 6 weeks post radiation. 20 had primary brain tumors whereas 3 had metastatic lesions in brain. Of the 23 patients, 14 patients (60.86%) had abnormal or increased daytime sleepiness; of which 3 had ESS scores greater than 16. Conclusion(s): Somnolence occurred in 60.86% of the patients who underwent radiation treatment for brain tumors, which is in accordance with existing literature.4,5 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an effective tool to detect and quantify somnolence, however it does not consider other symptoms of somnolence syndrome and hence should be combined with visual analog scale to get complete information.",Excluded

Radioligand distribution was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus (14.9 %ID/g at 60 min), moderate uptake in cortex (8.5 %ID/g at 60 min), and lowest uptake in the cerebellum (2.4 %ID/g at 60 min). Pretreatment with several different nAChR agonists (A-85380, (-)-nicotine, cytisine) significantly inhibited [I-125]-5-IA binding in all brain regions studied (P < 0.01) demonstrating the high specificity of the radioligand for nAChRs.

267,"A gene therapy/targeted radiotherapy strategy for radiation cell kill by. BACKGROUND: Although [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is currently one of the best agents available for targeted radiotherapy, its use is confined to a few neural crest derived tumours which accumulate the radiopharmaceutical via the noradrenaline transporter (NAT). To determine whether this drug could be used for the treatment of non-NAT expressing tumours following genetic manipulation, we previously showed that plasmid mediated transfection of NAT into a non-NAT expressing glioblastoma cell line, UVW, endowed the host cells with the capacity to actively accumulate [131I]MIBG. We now present data defining the conditions required for complete sterilisation of NAT transfected cells cultured as multicellular spheroids and treated with [131I]MIBG. METHOD(S): NAT transfected UVW cells, grown as monolayers and spheroids, were treated with various doses of [131I]MIBG and assessed for cell kill by clonogenic survival and measurement of spheroid volume over time (growth delay). Spheroids were left intact for different time periods to assess the effect of radiation crossfire on cell death. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Total clonogen sterilisation was observed when the cells were grown as three-dimensional spheroids and treated with 7 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. The added benefit of radiation crossfire was demonstrated by the improvement in cell kill achieved by prolongation of the maintenance of [131I]MIBG treated spheroids in their three-dimensional form, before disaggregation and clonogenic assay. When left intact for 48 h after treatment, spheroid cure was achieved by exposure to 6 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. These results demonstrate that the efficiency of cell kill by [131I]MIBG targeted therapy is strongly dependent on beta-particle crossfire irradiation. This gene therapy/targeted radiotherapy strategy has potential for [131I]MIBG mediated cell kill in tumours other than those derived from the neural crest.",Excluded

We have demonstrated that in rats activities of various enzymes related to gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism show circadian rhythms. Based on these results, we have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillation and phase response to light of the master clock located in the dorsomedial subdivision of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and found various proteins closely related to phase response such as BIT/SHPS-1 and those of circadian oscillation, some of which are involved in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.On the other hand, we have presented several lines of evidence that the ventrolateral subdivision of the SCN includes not only the control center of energy supply to the brain, but also that of homeostasis such as blood glucose, blood pressure, water balance, and body temperature. We have also shown that besides these functions, the latter subdivision is involved in the regulations of hormone secretions such as insulin, glucagon, corticosterone and vasopressin. It has been also shown by electrophysiological means that light exposure to rat eye enhances sympathetic nerve activity, whereas it depresses parasympathetic nerve activity.

2267,"Investigation of the spinal cord as a natural receptor antenna for incident electromagnetic waves and possible impact on the central nervous system. The effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure on biological systems have been studied for many years, both as a source of medical therapy and also for potential health risks. In particular, the mechanisms of EMF absorption in the human or animal body is of medical/engineering interest, and modern modelling techniques, such as the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD), can be utilized to simulate the voltages and currents induced in different parts of the body. The simulation of one particular component, the spinal cord, is the focus of this article, and this study is motivated by the fact that the spinal cord can be modelled as a linear conducting structure, capable of generating a significant amount of voltage from incident EMF. In this article, we show, through a FDTD simulation analysis of an incoming electromagnetic field (EMF), that the spinal cord acts as a natural antenna, with frequency dependent induced electric voltage and current distribution. The multi-frequency (100-2400 MHz) simulation results show that peak voltage and current response is observed in the FM radio range around 100 MHz, with significant strength to potentially cause changes in the CNS. This work can contribute to the understanding of the mechanism behind EMF energy leakage into the CNS, and the possible contribution of the latter energy leakage towards the weakening of the blood brain barrier (BBB), whose degradation is associated with the progress of many diseases, including Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).",Excluded
1576,"Lipid bilayer and water proton magnetization transfer: effect of cholesterol. Magnetization transfer between macromolecules and water can be a significant factor contributing to tissue water 1H relaxation. Using saturation transfer techniques, the degree of magnetization transfer between the macromolecular matrix and bulk water 1H can be directly measured and magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) can be generated in MR images. A significant degree of MTC has been observed in tissues with high plasma membrane content such as kidney and brain. The purpose of this study was to establish whether lipid bilayers, as models for cell membranes, could exchange magnetization with the water solvent and whether this effect could contribute to MTC observed in intact tissues. Magnetization transfer was measured in aqueous dispersions of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) in the presence and absence of cholesterol. It was found that neither EPC bilayers nor cholesterol by themselves significantly exchanged magnetization with bulk water 1H. However, as the concentration of cholesterol was increased, the pseudo-first-order magnetization exchange rate increased to a maximum value of approximately 1 s-1. The cholesterol-induced 1H magnetization exchange may be related either to longer correlation times of the lipid or to an increase in the number of water molecules associated with the bilayer. These results indicate that EPC-cholesterol bilayers exchange 1H magnetization with bulk water. These results are consistent with lipid bilayer contributions to bulk water relaxation and MTC in intact biological tissues.",Excluded
867,"Genetic and firefly metaheuristic algorithms for an optimized neuro-fuzzy prediction modeling of wildfire probability. In the terrestrial ecosystems, perennial challenges of increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are exacerbated by climate change and unplanned human activities. Development of robust management and suppression plans requires accurate estimates of future burn probabilities. This study describes the development and validation of two hybrid intelligence predictive models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA), for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.92; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.89; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.82; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolkits to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies.

3154,"Depression of involuntary activity in muscles paralyzed by spinal cord injury. Involuntary muscle contractions are common after spinal cord injury (SCI). Increased sensitivity to Ia muscle afferent input may contribute to the development of these spasms. Since tendon vibration results in a period of postactivation depression of the Ia synapse, we sought to determine whether Achilles tendon vibration (80 HZ for 2 s) altered involuntary contractions evoked by superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) stimulation (5 pulses at 300 HZ) in paralyzed leg muscles of subjects with chronic (>1 year) SCI. Responses to SPN stimulation that were conditioned by vibration were reduced in 66% of trials (by 33+/-12% in tibialis anterior and 40+/-16% in soleus). These reductions in electromyographic activity are unlikely to be mediated by changes at the Ia synapse or motoneuron because vibration did not alter the magnitude of the soleus H reflex. The electromyographic reductions may involve long-lasting neuromodulatory effects on spinal inhibitory interneurons or synapses involved in the flexor reflex pathway.

3144,"Role for ATM in DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1. The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar ataxia, radiosensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint defects, and cancer predisposition. The gene product [ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM)] mutated in this syndrome is a component of the DNA damage detection pathway. Loss of ATM function in human and mouse cells causes defects in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control and, not surprisingly, humans and mice with compromised ATM function are prone to cancers. An excess of breast cancer in the relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia patients has also been reported by epidemiological studies. Predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers is also observed in women with germline mutations in BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene. BRCA1 is a nuclear protein with a cell cycle-regulated expression pattern and is hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA-damaging agents. Here we show that rapid ionizing radiation-induced in vivo phosphorylation of BRCA1 requires the presence of functional ATM protein. Furthermore, we show that ATM interacts with BRCA1, and this association is enhanced by radiation. We also demonstrate that BRCA1 is a substrate of ATM kinase in vitro and in vivo. Using phospho-specific antibodies against serines 1387, 1423, and 1457 of BRCA1, we demonstrate radiation-induced, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 at these sites. These findings show that BRCA1 is regulated by an ATM-dependent mechanism as a part of the cellular response to DNA damage. This interaction between ATM and BRCA1 argues in favor of the involvement of particular aspects of ATM function in breast cancer predisposition.",Excluded
75,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC. For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded
700,"Preclinical radiotherapy at the Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline: instrumentation, dosimetry and a small-animal feasibility study. Therapeutic applications of synchrotron X-rays such as microbeam (MRT) and minibeam (MBRT) radiation therapy promise significant advantages over conventional clinical techniques for some diseases if successfully transferred to clinical practice. Preclinical studies show clear evidence that a number of normal tissues in animal models display a tolerance to much higher doses from MRT compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, a wide spread in the parameters studied makes it difficult to make any conclusions about the associated tumour control or normal tissue complication probabilities. To facilitate more systematic and reproducible preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies, a dedicated preclinical station including small-animal irradiation stage was designed and installed at the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron. The stage was characterized in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the vertical scanning speed, as this is the key variable in dose delivery. The measured speed was found to be within 1% of the nominal speed for the range of speeds measured by an interferometer. Furthermore, dose measurements confirm the expected relationship between speed and dose and show that the measured dose is independent of the scan direction. Important dosimetric parameters such as peak dose, valley dose, the collimator output factor and peak-to-valley dose ratio are presented for 5 mm x 5 mm, 10 mm x 10 mm and 20 mm x 20 mm field sizes. Finally, a feasibility study on three glioma-bearing rats was performed. MRT and MBRT doses were prescribed to achieve an average dose of 65 Gy in the target, and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up was performed at various time points after irradiation to follow the tumour volume. Although it is impossible to draw conclusions on the different treatments with such a small number of animals, the feasibility of end-to-end preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies using the IMBL preclinical stage is demonstrated.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent a wide range of predominantly indolent tumors which may cause serious functional deficits if ignored yet its treatment may result in severe iatrogenic morbidity. Surgery and radiation therapy are both established modalities when treatment is warranted but how to integrate these two modalities to optimize tumor control, minimize iatrogenic morbidity and preserve organ function is not clearly established. To this end, a prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was established at our center over the past decade. Patients were diagnosed by anatomic and functional imaging characteristics typically determined by CT/MRI and octreotide avidity. In general, patients who had a solitary carotid body tumor were offered surgery; while those involving the skull base were offered radiation therapy and those with multiple paragangliomas were offered either surgery for the smaller tumor and radiation for the remaining tumors or radiation for all tumors. Materials/Methods: From 1998-2011, 51 patients (42F:9M) were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Median age was 64 years (range, 19-92 year). Paraganglioma subsites were as follows: jugular 44% (n=24), tympanic 20% (n=11), vagal 15% (n=8), carotid body 13% (n=7), parasympathetic 2% (n=1). Two patients had bilateral tumors, while 2 patients had 3 synchronous tumors. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy (21-50.4 Gy) treated with 3D technique in 72% (n=39), IMRT in 20% (n=11) or SBRT 2% (n=1). During this time period, 38 patients underwent primary surgery of whom 6 received adjuvant radiation therapy. Result(s): At a median follow-up of 34 months (4-103 mos), one patient treated with radiation therapy failed at 37 months for a 3 year actuarial LC 100% and 5 year LC 94%. None of the 38 surgically treated failed. Patients who received radiation therapy experienced grade 1/2 complications including mucositis (13%) or xerostomia (23%), and two patients developed dizziness (5%). Of patients who underwent surgical excision, four patients had post-operative cranial nerve deficits, including vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, hearing loss, and temporary facial nerve weakness. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this experience represents the first prospective algorithmic-based multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on single modality treatment that demonstrates excellent tumor control, low rates of severe iatrogenic morbidity and long-term function preservation. While both surgery and radiation result in excellent tumor control, radiation therapy should be considered a primary treatment for skull-based paraganglioma for which it offers a high therapeutic ratio.",Excluded

2734,"Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for unilateral thalamotomy in medication refractory essential tremor. Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and is associated with significant functional impairment and disability. Ablative and stimulation-based surgical treatments have been developed to treat the significant number of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management. Although often providing effective tremor control, current surgical options have risks associated with intracranial procedures, as well as issues of durability and predictability of treatment response. Here, we explore the application of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as an alternative, non-invasive means of generating thalamic lesions in patients with treatment-resistant ET. Method(s): Four patients underwent awake MRgFUS thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor (mean age 70.8; mean duration of illness 17.8 years). Diagnosis of refractory ET was confirmed by a movement disorder neurologist, and patients underwent baseline medical and imaging investigations prior to treatment. Tremor assessments and serial structural imaging were performed at 1, 7, 30 and 90 days following the procedure. Result(s): All four patients experienced immediate and sustained improvements in their dominant (treated) hand tremor (Figure 1). At 1- and 3-months following treatment, dominant hand tremor scores were reduced by a mean of 89% and 78%, respectively, on part A of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Functional impairment decreased significantly at 3-months, with patients reporting improvements in writing, drinking and eating. There were no serious adverse events, with only one patient reporting persistent lip and finger paraesthesias at 3-months. Conclusion(s): MRgFUS appears to be a safe and effective means of non-invasively generating thalamic lesions for the relief of refractory ET. This technology is a promising alternative to radiation- and surgical-based approaches to lesional functional neurosurgery, but requires larger trials with more patients to verify its efficacy.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 80 patients with intracranial mengiomas treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery between 1993 and 1996. The purpose was to analyze the efficacy of the treatment and to assess appropriate treatment parameters. The results were assessed by regular MR examinations, and tumor volume was measured at 6-month intervals. Mean follow-up duration was 21 months (range 6-45 months). 63 meningiomas were at the skull base and 17 were distal from the skull base. Tumor volumes <5 ml (n=38), 5-10 ml (n=21), 10-15 ml (n=14), 15-20 ml (n=7). The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the radiation dose. The groups were high- dose (peripheral dose 17-20 Gy, n=19), medium-dose (15-16 Gy, n=33) and low- dose (12-14 Gy, n=28) groups. A statistical method (Generalized Estimation Equation) was applied to compare treatment results in these groups with different doses and tumor volumes. The volume measurement at the latest follow-up showed 74% (59/80) meningiomas decreased in volume, 17% (14/80) had no tumor enlargement and 9% (7/80) had increased in volume. The increased volume was found more frequently in the patients with a short (6-12 months) follow-up period. In this series, the tumors had 32% reduction in average tumor volume at 3 years after radiosurgery. At the range of 12-20 Gy peripheral dose (PD), radiosurgery was effective to reduce tumor volume 0.7% per month (p<0.05). However, higher doses had no significant difference on tumor volume reduction (p > 0.05). On the other hand, high-dose (PD > 17 Gy) treatment was associated with a higher risk of temporary tumor swelling and the development of adverse radiation effects (AREs). The AREs detected on MR images occurred in (25/80) 31% patients. Only 6/25 AREs were symptomatic and 2 had neurological sequelae. Peripheral doses, tumor volumes and their locations had significant impacts on the ARE (p<0.05). In conclusion, a peripheral dose of 15-16 Gy may be adequate for meningiomas with small volumes (<=5 ml). In larger tumors (>=10 ml) a lower PD is preferred (12-14 Gy). To avoid initial tumor swelling and ARE, high-dose irradiation (PD > 17 Gy) is not recommended for meningiomas larger than 5 ml.",Excluded

2425,"PCI-no. What does prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) prevent in ED-SCLC? - Why isn't the presence of brain metastasis evaluated before performing PCI? Background: In a European trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was performed on patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED- SCLC). As a result, PCI was reported to reduce the incidence of symptomatic brain metastasis and to prolong patient survival. However, their treatments were completely different from our routine medical care. For example, they did not perform tests to examine whether there was a metastatic brain tumor before assignment to the PCI group or observation group and, after assignment, symptoms alone were observed and no imaging test was performed. For this reason, in Japan, we corrected this inconsistency of protocol and repeated the trial to determine whether PCI contributes to prolonged survival. Participants and Method: Included in the current trial were patients who underwent two or more cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, had achieved at least stable disease (SD), and had no metastatic brain tumor on their MRI. They were randomly assigned to either the PCI group or observation group. Follow-up with brain, chest and abdominal diagnostic imaging tests was performed every three months in both groups. Result(s): In the first pre-specified interim analysis, it was found that there was no possibility of improving patient prognosis using PCI even if the trial were continued. An independent data monitoring committee therefore terminated the trial. At that time, 224 cases had already been enrolled, with 113 cases assigned to the PCI group and 111 cases to the observation group. Median survival period in the final analysis was 11.6 months for the PCI group and 13.7 months for the observation group (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.68). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, but PCI actually tended to make the prognosis somewhat worse or, at least, did not improve prognosis in patients with ED-SCLC. Discussion(s): The biggest difference between the two trials was whether follow-up assessments were conducted using symptoms or brain MRI. In the current trial, it is impossible to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic brain metastasis cases; however, in the European trial, asymptomatic brain metastasis cases were also included, which means that there were in fact two different subgroups in the PCI group: a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis undergoing therapeutic cranial irradiation and a subgroup of patients without brain metastasis undergoing true PCI. It seems that the survival difference between patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis in the PCI group and in the observation group caused the apparent improvement of survival period. On the other hand, it is conjectured that PCI generated a lot of toxic effects in the patients without brain metastasis and that their survival curve tended to be inferior. PCI is a treatment to prevent new brain metastasis. One year of PCI reduces the incidence of new brain metastasis in no more than 30% of cases.

1571,"Improving outcome in severe trauma: what's new in ABC? Imaging, bleeding and brain injury. Appropriate imaging is critical in the initial assessment of patients with severe trauma. Plain radiographs remain integral to the primary survey. Focused ultrasonography is useful for identifying intraperitoneal fluid likely to represent haemorrhage in patients who are shocked and also has a role in identifying intrathoracic pathology. Modern scanners permit a greater role for CT, being more rapid and exposing the patient to less ionising radiation. 'Whole body' (head to pelvis) CT scanning has been shown to identify injuries missed by 'traditional' focused assessment and may be associated with an improved outcome. CT identifies more spinal injuries than plain radiographs, is the gold standard for diagnosing blunt aortic injury and facilitates non-operative management of solid organ injury and other bleeding. Coagulopathy occurs early in trauma as a direct result of injury and hypoperfusion. Damage control resuscitation with blood components is associated with an improved outcome in patients with trauma with massive haemorrhage. Packed cells and fresh frozen plasma should be used in a 1:1 to 1:2 ratio. Bedside measures of coagulopathy may prove useful. Adjuvant early treatment with tranexamic acid is of benefit in reducing blood loss and reducing mortality. Limited 'damage control surgery' with early optimisation of physiology augmented by interventional radiology to control haemorrhage is preferable to early definitive care. Limiting haemorrhage by correction of anticoagulation and minimising secondary brain injury through optimal supportive care is critical to improving outcome in neurotrauma.",Excluded
1851,"MDM2 overexpression is associated with short survival in adults with medulloblastoma. In adult medulloblastoma, postoperative radiotherapy is significantly effective in prolonging time to recurrence and survival time; however, the response of individual cases to radiotherapy, that is the total survival, is different. Apoptosis is an important cellular response to radiation. It can be hypothesized that the individual radiosensitivity of medulloblastomas depends on the individual capability to undergo apoptosis. p53 protein is involved in the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation; loss of function of p53 can be the consequence not only of TP53 mutations, but also of amplification and/or overexpression of the MDM2 gene. We have analyzed cerebellar medulloblastomas from 51 adults (>16 years of age) for MDM2 gene amplification (by differential polymerase chain reaction assay), TP53 gene mutation (by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8), and immunohistochemical expression of p53 (clone DO1) and MDM2 (clone IF2). The results have been evaluated in relation to age, tumor location, classic or desmoplastic type, MIB-1 labeling index, and total survival. No tumor had MDM2 amplification. Ten tumors had MDM2 positive tumor cells. One case had a mutated TP53 gene; 16/51 cases had intense p53 immunostaining. Only 2 MDM2 protein-positive tumors were also p53-positive. Both subgroups of MDM2 - and p53-positive tumors had a significantly shorter postoperative survival. In conclusion, the overexpression of MDM2 protein and the accumulation of wild-type p53 are unrelated in adult medulloblastoma; they may result in a reduced apoptotic response after radiotherapy and contribute to a shortened survival. Also, MDM2 amplification and TP53 gene mutation are rare events in medulloblastomas of adults.",Excluded
741,"RADIANS: A Multidisciplinary Central Nervous System Clinic Model for Radiation Oncology and Neurosurgery Practice. BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for central nervous system disease commonly involves collaboration between Radiation Oncology and Neurosurgery. We describe our early experience with a multidisciplinary clinic model.METHODS: In 2016, the novel RADIANS (RADIation oncology And NeuroSurgery) clinic model was initiated at a community hospital. Disease and treatment demographics were collected and analyzed. Patient satisfaction was assessed via a blinded survey questionnaire.RESULTS: Forty-two patients have been seen since the inception of RADIANS. The median age was 65; and the median patient distance from RADIANS was 42.7 miles (mean = 62.6; range = 0.7-285). Half of the patients traveled >50 miles to receive care, and >80% were seen for central nervous system metastases. Of the patients receiving radiation, 75% received stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy. The mean overall satisfaction from 0 (not satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) was 4.8.CONCLUSIONS: The RADIANS clinic model has proved viable and well-liked by patients in a community setting, with the majority of radiation therapy administered being stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy rather than conventional fractionation.",Excluded
2446,"Neuroprotective effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in mice through modulating mitochondrial dynamics. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of protein inclusions and the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis is thought to be important for the pathogenesis of PD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, constitutes a promising approach for promoting recovery of various neurological conditions. However, little is known about its mechanism of action. The present study elucidated the neuroprotective effects of tDCS on the mitochondrial quality control pathway in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. We used the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in vivo model. Mice were stimulated for 5 consecutive days with MPTP treatment. After observation of behavioral alteration using the rotarod test, mice were sacrificed for the measurement of the PD- and mitochondrial quality control-related protein levels in the substantia nigra. tDCS improved the behavioral alterations and changes in tyrosine hydroxylase levels in MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, tDCS attenuated mitochondrial damage, as indicated by diminished mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase activity in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model. MPTP significantly increased mitophagy and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins. These changes were attenuated by tDCS. Furthermore, MPTP significantly increased fission-related protein dynamin-related protein 1 with no effect on fusion-related protein mitofusin-2, and tDCS attenuated these changes. Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of anodal tDCS on the MPTP-induced neurotoxic mouse model through suppressing excessive mitophagy and balancing mitochondrial dynamics. The neuroprotective effect of anodal tDCS with modulation of mitochondrial dynamics provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.",Excluded

Accordingly, in this study, we used magnetic graphene oxide (NGO/SPIONs) nanoparticles coated with PLGA polymer as a dynamic nanocarrier for IUdR and, evaluated its sensitizing enhancement ratio in combination with a single dose X-ray at clinically megavoltage energies for treatment of C6 glioma rats. Nanoparticles were characterized using Zetasizer and TEM microscopy, and in vitro biocompatibility of nanoparticles was assessed with MTT assay. IUdR/MNPs were intravenously administered under a magnetic field (1.3 T) on day 13 after the implantation of C6 cells. After a day following the injection, rats exposed with radiation (8 Gy). ICP-OES analysis data indicated an effective magnetic targeting, leading to remarkably improved penetration through the BBB. In vivo release analysis with HPLC indicated sustained release of IUdR and, prolonged the lifespan in plasma (P <.01). In addition, our findings revealed a synergistic effect for IUdR/MNPs coupled with radiation, which significantly inhibited the tumor expansion (>100%), prolonged the survival time (>100%) and suppressed the anti-apoptotic response of glioma rats by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (2.13-fold) in compared with the radiation-only. In conclusion, besides high accumulation in targeted tumor sites, the newly developed IUdR/MNPs, also exhibited the ability of IUdR/MNPs to significantly enhance radiosensitizing effect, improve therapeutic efficacy and increase toxicity for glioma-bearing rats.

The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of F-FDG PET/CT vs. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/MR in differentiating PD from RC in a subpopulation of malignant gliomas. METHOD(S): We evaluated 10 patients with high-grade gliomas whom had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and developed MR evidence of PD per RANO criteria. All patients underwent <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/MR (MR attenuation correction, PET/MR<sup>AC</sup>), and conventional diagnostic MR (PET/MR<sup>D</sup>). pMR was also performed. Separate consensus blinded readings by two fellowship-trained radiologists (1 neuroradiology; 1 nuclear) were performed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of PET/CT, PET/MR<sup>AC</sup>PET/MR<sup>D</sup>. A qualitative subjective rating was given to each lesion (1 = definite RC; 2 = probable RC; 3 = equivocal; 4 = probable PD; 5 = definite PD). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were determined for the three interpretation sessions after binary reclassification, with a rating of 1-3 defined as RC and 4-5 defined as PD. Wilcoxon-rank test was used for rating comparison between the three interpretations. RESULT(S): PET/CT yielded sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.78, 1.00, and 0.80, respectively.

Multimodality neurodiagnostic testing, including CT, MR imaging, xenon-enhanced CT, evoked potential studies, and analysis of CSF myelin basic protein levels, all of which eventually were correlated with neuropathologic examination, enabled detection of lesions produced with high-dose (150 Gy) radiosurgery as early as 6 weeks. Within the first 6 months after radiosurgery, lower doses (20 Gy, 50 Gy) did not result in clinically or neurodiagnostically detectable lesions. The rat arteriovenous fistula model permits analysis of the delayed histopathologic effects of radiosurgery on an experimentally created fistula designed to mimic an AVM.

1073,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) presenting as solitary CNS lymphoma: A rare occurrence. Introduction: PTLD associated lymphoma is the second most common malignancy in patients receiving SOT or HSCT with an incidence rate of 1%-3%. PCNS-PTLD occurs in 7%-15% of all PTLD cases. We present a case of isolated PCNS lymphoma two years after renal transplant. Case Description: A 57 year old woman with PMH of ESRD s/p kidney transplant (D/EBV -,R/ EBV +) with chronic CrCl of 30-40% presented with paresthesia and numbness over the right side of her body with mild ataxia 2 years post transplant. Physical exam revealed only numbness over the right side of body. MRI with contrast revealed a left thalamic lesion with moderate vasogenic edema, and MR spectroscopy confirmed high grade neoplasm involving left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy showed polymorphic CD-20 and EBV positive PTLD. EBV PCR were elevated. Further evaluation ruled out systemic PTLD. Myfortic was stopped and oral steroids started with mild improvement in symptoms. Choice of systemic chemotherapy was limited due to reduced CrCl and risks of graft failure. She received modified regimen with renally adjusted high dose Methotrexate, Vincristine and Rituximab for 6 cycles with partial remission and then Temozolomide for 7 cycles with complete remission. Discussion(s): The incidence of PTLD ranges from 1 to 25% with 90% of cases being EBV-associated, CD20 positive, B cell neoplasms. PCNS-PTLD has a higher incidence in renal SOT, occurs late and is usually monomorphic unlike our patient. Median time of occurrence is 4-5 years after transplant. Risk factors include age, intensity of immunosuppression, time to transplant and EBV status of donor and recipient. Common presenting features include neurological deficits, seizure, and raised intracranial pressure. MRI is the preferred imaging and shows multifocal, ill defined, ring enhancing lesions usually in supratentorial and lobar regions. Positive CSF EBV PCR is highly suggestive but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment modalities include reduction of immunosuppression, rituximab, high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and cranial radiotherapy. Use of high dose methotrexate has shown improved outcomes with median survival of 26-47 months. Lack of response to first line therapy is considered the dominant prognostic factor.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the role of limited field radiation therapy in the management of high-grade gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).MATERIAL AND METHODS: From July '96 to January '98, 50 newly diagnosed patients of high-grade gliomas (Grade III and IV) and glioblastoma multiforme who underwent surgery in the form of partial, sub-total or near-total excision as the primary treatment were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized to receive two different postoperative external radiation protocols, Study Group A: Localized field external radiotherapy 50 Gy/25#/5 wks followed by Boost 10 Gy/5#/1 wk, Control Group B: Whole brain external radiotherapy 40 Gy/20#/4 wks followed by Boost 20 Gy/10#/2 wks by localized field.RESULTS: 20/25 (80%) patients in the study group and 14/25 (56%) patients in the control group showed improvement in their Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Thus a significant difference in the performance status was noted in favor of limited field irradiation. No significant difference in the local response was seen between the two groups after radiotherapy. Six months progression-free survival of the study group was 44% as compared to 26% in the control group. Six months overall survival was 66.67% in the study group and 50.72% in the control group (P<0.01).

3204,"Models of bystander signalling between primary astrocytes and glioma cells: Effects on survival and migration/invasion. INTRODUCTION: The goal of radiotherapy is to cause cell death in the targeted tumour field and minimize toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue.",Excluded
864,"Evaluation of Peritumoral Edema in the Delineation of Radiotherapy Clinical Target Volumes for Glioblastoma. Purpose: To evaluate the spatial relationship between peritumoral edema and recurrence pattern in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight primary GBM patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy that did not intentionally include peritumoral edema within the clinical target volume between July 2000 and June 2001. All 48 patients have subsequently recurred, and their original treatment planning parameters were used for this study. New theoretical radiation treatment plans were created for the same 48 patients, based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) target delineation guidelines that specify inclusion of peritumoral edema. Target volume and recurrent tumor coverage, as well as percent volume of normal brain irradiated, were assessed for both methods of target delineation using dose-volume histograms. Result(s): A comparison between the location of recurrent tumor and peritumoral edema volumes from all 48 cases failed to show correlation by linear regression modeling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0007; p = 0.3). For patients with edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, the percent volume of brain irradiated to 46 Gy was significantly greater in treatment plans that intentionally included peritumoral edema compared with those that did not (38% vs. 31%; p = 0.003). The pattern of failure was identical between the two sets of plans (40 central, 3 in-field, 3 marginal, and 2 distant recurrence). Conclusion(s): Clinical target volume delineation based on a 2-cm margin rather than on peritumoral edema did not seem to alter the central pattern of failure for patients with GBM.

2479,"Radiation dose during coronary angiography: Correlation to body mass index. Introduction: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a commonly performed procedure in cardiology, resulting in patients being exposed to radiation. Patients with high body mass index (BMI) are at increased risk of coronary artery disease. Catheter laboratory intensifiers use automatic exposure control (AEC) which adjusts radiation dose aiming to provide optimal quality images. Factors shown to be responsible for dose variability are complexity of the procedure, operator experience, their level of training in radiation protection, type and performance of x-ray equipment. The objective of present study was to evaluate if radiation dose received by patients correlated with BMI. Method(s): Retrospective data for 3678 CAG performed from Sep-07 to Mar-10 from a single centre, were analysed. Radiation dose was calculated as Dose Area Product (DAP) in mGym . Result(s): Mean radiation dose during the procedure was 4339 +/- 286 mGym . Mean BMI, contrast volume used and screening time were 29.22 +/- 0.08 kg/m2, 125 +/- 10.0 ml and 5.2 +/- 0.1 minutes respectively. BMI was positively correlated with increasing radiation dose during CAG (graph-1 &2). Patients with increased BMI did not require prolonged procedure or increased contrast volume. There was no significant inter-operator variability. Even Ten degree increase in angulation (oblique, cranial or caudal) increased radiation dose significantly. Conclusion(s): Patients with increased BMI receive a significantly higher radiation dose during CAG, affecting not only the patient, but every one present in the catheter laboratory.

991,"Regulation of neurite outgrowth by intermittent irradiation of visible light. The effect of neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells on collagen-coated glass plates under intermittent light irradiation at 525 nm and 0.4 mW/cm2 of intensity was investigated. Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was significantly suppressed when PC12 cells were cultivated under intermittent light irradiation with a total irradiation time of more than 2 min/h. No temperature increase was observed in the culture medium under either continuous or intermittent light irradiation. Therefore, suppression of neurite outgrowth under light irradiation was not due to the increase of temperature in the culture medium, but rather the effect of light on the PC12 cells, especially the signal transmittance of light to PC12 cells. The light irradiation interval also affected the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells when the total irradiation time was constant. A high extension ratio of neurite outgrowth was observed under a long time interval of nonirradiation between light irradiations (1 min of irradiation every hour) as compared with frequent light irradiation intervals (5 s of irradiation every 5 min) with the same total irradiation period per hour. The neurite outgrowth ratio was thought to be dependent on the light intensity, the total time of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation, and the interval of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation.",Excluded

He also developed slight neurologic symptoms such as numbness, paraesthesias and a slight weakness of the right leg. The symptoms had begun 6 months after radiation therapy after prostatectomy for prostate carcinoma. There were no antecendent back or hip injuries. There was a right Lasegue sign. On the visual analog scale pain ranks between 0 (rest) and 8-10 (attack) were recorded. Needle electromyography showed denervation in gluteus medius and maximus, biceps femoris, quadriceps femoris, tibialis ant and peroneus longus. Normal laboratory studies included urin analysis, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimention rate, serumglucose, electrolytes, rheumatoid factor, and protein electrophoresis.

1873,"Prospective Peer Review for Patients Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Intracranial Radiosurgery in a Multi-Site Community-Setting is Both Feasible and Effective. Purpose/Objective(s): Delivery of stereotactic radiation requires a level of quality assurance beyond traditional fractionation given the impact of misdelivery. While efforts to improve peer review at academic centers have been reported, very few guidelines exist in the literature for implementation of a program with more intensive review of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or intracranial radiosurgery (SRS) in a community-based setting. Here, we report on the logistics as well as the first 260 cases reviewed in one year of a pilot program at a community-based multi-location network of radiation oncology facilities. Materials/Methods: We implemented a departmental process at four network radiation facilities affiliated with an academic institution that no SBRT or SRS case could be treated without a second physician approving the contours and plan prior to delivery of the first fraction. Coincident with this process, we began an SBRT/SRS peer review rounds for 30-60 minutes per week. Ideally, cases were reviewed initially for contour approval including targets, organs at risk (OAR), image registration, and overall directive/modality selection. Cases approved in this phase progressed to planning and were reviewed the following week for final peer approval. Cases with more urgent turnaround times, particularly intracranial radiosurgery, were often required to be reviewed outside of rounds by a second physician. Recommendations for changes in both the contouring/directive review phase and the planning phase were collected prospectively. Changes were designated major changes retrospectively by the physician team if the change materially altered the final plan. Result(s): From March 2019 to February 2020, 260 cases were treated with SBRT or SRS in our network. 56 cases (21.5%) had a change recommendation. 19 (7%) cases had a major revision. 95% (53 cases) of changes detected by this program were during the contouring/intent phase of planning with only 5% (3 cases) requiring revision at the planning phase or at treatment delivery. Most common deviations detected tracked closely with cases reported in the ASTRO RO-ILS system such as OAR (35%) and target revisions (18%), minor prescription adjustments (25%) and prior radiation dose not accounted for (9%). Near universal prospective peer review of stereotactic cases (99.5%) was accomplished using this system. Conclusion(s): Here, we demonstrate that prospective peer review is both feasible and results in a significant number of changes - 21.5% of cases reviewed. Major changes that materially altered the plan occurred in 19 of 260 cases (7%). This system allowed for near universal prospective peer review of these cases with no significant delay in planning or treatment with a low burden on physicians and staff of approximately 1 hour per week per physician. Prospective peer review also resulted in very few re-planned cases in the post-planning phase including plan check and changes discovered at the time of treatment delivery (1% overall).

3110,"Use of non-ablative dose of radiation to enhance delivery of unmodified morpholino oligonucleotides in a brain tumor model to silence mgmt and enhance the efficacy of chemo-radiation. Objective: Non-ablative Ionizing radiation ( XRT) is well known to alter neuro-vascular unit (NVU) permeability. We evaluate the use of XRT to enhance delivery of intravenously administered Morpholino Oligonucleotides designed to silence O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in a MGMT expressing human derived brain tumor xenograft model. Background(s): MGMT, a key DNA repair enzyme is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously reported the use of a non-ablative dose of ionizing radiation (XRT) to prime human cancer cells to enhance the uptake of unmodified anti-MGMT morpholino oligonucleotides (AMONs) to achieve statistically significant reduction in the in-vitro proliferation index and cell viability with a single dose of AMONs and TMZ. Our prior work has demonstrated that this is by enlarge mediated by up regulation of physiologic endocytosis after XRT. Design/Methods: Intracranial tumor (MGMT expressing human derived H460 non-small cell lung cancer, n=12) bearing athymic nude rats received a single dose of cranial radiation (2Gy) with oral TMZ for 4 consecutive days starting on the day of XRT. In addition, six animals were randomly selected to receive AMON (10.5mg/kg) 24 hrs after XRT, the remaining served as controls. All animals were euthanized and brains harvested 7 days after XRT and tumor volumes measured by immunoblotting. This experiments was repeated in human derived D283 medulloblastoma xenografts (n=12) Results: A 60% (p=0.034) reduction in MGMT expression was noted in brain tumors treated with XRT and iv AMONs. Although not significant, a 40% reduction in tumors volumes were noted in the animals treated with a single dose of AMONs and chemo-radiation. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the first use of XRT to guide and enhance delivery of AMONS to brain tumors. In this proof of concept study, silencing MGMT enhances the toxicity of XRT and TMZ.

Background: Annually, more than 4,000 patients are diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) from breast cancer in the U.S. Since most therapies cannot cross the Blood-CSF-Barrier (BCB) and the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB), treatment options for LC are limited to local radiation and few chemotherapy agents, none of which have provided durable clinical benefit, leading to short overall survival (OS) of 3-4 months. ANG1005 is a novel peptide-drug conjugate, consisting of 3 paclitaxel molecules covalently linked to a peptide that targets the LRP-1 receptor to cross both BCB and BBB, and enter the tumor cells, where the paclitaxel is cleaved off to exert its anti-tumor activity. ANG1005 has previously shown in a phase 2 study to prolong OS in LC patients from breast cancer with brain metastases (BM) to 8 months. Trial Design: This is an open-label, multi-center phase 3 randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of ANG1005 in HER2-negative breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM when compared to Physician Best Choice (PBC).

CNS disease (LC and BM) will be evaluated at screening and every 6 weeks by MRI, CSF cytology and neurological assessments according to LANO and RANO-BM criteria. Extracranial disease will be evaluated by CT scans according to RECIST at screening and every 6-12 weeks. All patients will be foliowed for survival every 6-8 weeks from the date of the last dose until death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal. Eligibility Criteria: Eligible patients are adults (E 18 years old) with HER2-negative breast cancer, newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM. Patients must be neurologically stable and have adequate blood counts, organ and bone marrow function with an ECOG status grade 2. Patients previously treated with ANG1005 or with known allergy to paclitaxel or its components are excluded. Specific aims: The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include CNS (LC and BM) progression-free survival and clinical benefit rate, 6-and 12-month OS rates, LC response rate and duration of response, OS for triple negative patients and safety. Statistical Methods: This study is sized for testing the hypothesis of improved OS for ANG1005 versus PBC in all patients (HR=0.58, two-sided test, overall type 1 error of 5%). Interim analysis for OS (using O'Brien Fleming boundaries for efficacy and a fixed HR=1 for futility) will be performed when a total of 55 death events are reached across both arms.

1937,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy).RESULTS: Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer. Continued evaluation of curative-intent, combined-modality therapy that includes IOERT is warranted in this high-risk population.",Excluded

2277,"Cross-sectional analysis of resource utilization among patients with neuroendocrine tumours. Background: Although there is high morbidity and mortality associated with neuroendocrine tumours (NET), there are limited data in the literature to quantify the economic impact in this patient population. The aim of this study was to understand resource use among advanced NET patients. Material(s) and Method(s): An online survey was administered to physicians in the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, and Italy to collect data on patients with advanced NET. The survey gathered data on the incidence and frequency of resource use (e.g. chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs [SSA], PRRT). Result(s): Of the 4,100 surveys administered, 197 physicians participated (4.8%), providing data for 394 NET patients. Among all patients, nonpancreatic GI tract was the most common primary site (45.4%), followed by pancreas (30.7%). Resource utilization was high across tumour types as shown in Table 1. The most common types of chemotherapy used were: 5-fluorouracil (16.2%), etoposide (15.5%), and cisplatin (14.8%). (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): Results confirm that advanced NET is associated with significant resource use, regardless of tumour site. In addition to SSAs, patients are treated with chemotherapy and radiation-based approaches and twice as many patients are treated with targeted therapies in the pNET group as compared to the GI/Lung NET population.",Excluded
2101,"Lymphopoiesis in the chicken pineal gland. Pineal lymphoid development was studied in two breeds of chickens from hatching until sexual maturity. No lymphocytes were found in the pineal prior to 9 days of age (da). Lymphocytes migrate through the endothelium of venules into the pineal stroma. Lymphoid tissue reached its maximal accumulation in 32-da pineal glands of both breeds. At this age, the New Hampshire (NH) breed had a larger proportion of lymphoid volume to total pineal volume (32%) than did pineal glands from White Leghorn (WL) chickens (18%). Averaged over the period 23 to 62 da, NH chickens (a heavy breed) had a lymphoid volume (0.753 mm 3) that was about three times greater (P less than 0.05) than that of the lighter WL breed (0.251 mm 3). Lymphocytes are able to enter cerebrospinal fluid form lymphoid accumulations (LA) embedded in the choroid plexus by migrating between choroid ependymal cells. The 122-da chickens typically lacked lymphoid tissue in the pineal gland with the exception of occasional LA contained in capsular tissue. Surgical bursectomy, thymectomy, or their combination at hatching followed with whole-body irradiation (IR) at 24 hours postsurgery inhibited the initial influx of lymphocytes usually seen in 9-da pineal glands. Also, these treatments prevented formation of germinal centers normally found in the pineal at 3 and 5 weeks and reduced total pineal volume at each age examined. However, pineal lymphoid volume of the surgical-IR group did not differ from control-IR chickens at either 3 or 5 weeks. Pineal glands from birds made agammaglobulinemic (bursa-cell depleted) by cyclophosphamide treatment in ovo were devoid of germinal centers, although thin strands of lymphocytes were usually found along venous sinuses. These dissociation studies suggest that the normal expression of lymphoid tissue in the chicken pineal gland is dependent on the bursa and thymus. Furthermore, these observations indicate that the pineal gland should be considered a functional component of the chicken's lymphomyeloid complex.",Excluded
1991,"Steroid responsive migratory brain lesions causing intractable epilepsy in multiple myeloma. Objective: Description of a patient with multiple myeloma presenting with intractable epilepsy, steroid responsive, and recurrent abnormal T2 signal on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Background(s): Paraneoplastic epilepsy has been described in association with multiple malignancies and has been related to the presence of various antibodies, and/or malignancy spread to the central nervous system (CNS). Here we describe a unique presentation of refractory epilepsy associated with steroid responsive CNS lesions in the setting of multiple myeloma. Design/Methods: N/A Results: A 64 year old man presented with episodic expressive aphasia. His medical history was significant for IgA Kappa multiple myeloma with metastases to the spine since 2013; treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. MRI showed abnormal T2 hyperintense signal on juxtacortical white matter and cortex with no restricted diffusion or contrast enhancement. Seizures seen on EEG were treated. Paraneoplastic, infectious, and malignancy work up was negative, except for >5 oligoclonal bands in serum and CSF suggesting systemic inflammation with secondary CNS involvement. Two weeks later the symptoms reoccurred. MRI showed progression and intravenous solumedrol (IVSM) treatment lead to clinical and radiological improvement. Follow up MRI four months later showed resolution of findings. However, a few weeks later, he presented with status epilepticus (SE). MRI showed multiple new lesions; he received IVSM, which provided a satisfactory response. He was discharged on prednisone. MRI two months later showed marked improvement and prednisone was reduced to 20mg/day. In July, symptoms reoccurred so he was treated again for SE and his MRI showed extensive new lesions. Despite aggressive treatment with anticonvulsants, IVSM and intravenous immunoglobulin, clinical, electrographic and radiographic progression persisted. Family opted for comfort care.

3230,"Brain photodiagnosis (PD), fluorescence guided resection (FGR) and photodynamic therapy (PDT): Past, present and future. Intracranial tumours are an excellent target for photodiagnosis (PD), fluorescence guided resection (FGR) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), because the tumour to brain ratio of photosensitizers' concentration is very high. However, several attempts of proving the value of PDT in the most malignant type of brain tumours, gliobastoma multeforme (GBM) failed to demonstrate any significant worthwhile survival advantage in the past because of the very nature of this cancer and several compounding factors that led to this apparent disappointing outcome; variations in the photosensitizer and light dosages, variations in the photosensitizer administration to treatment time-intervals, and variations in photosensitizers used are just few to mention in this article. However, after a very long gestation period of brain PD, FGR and PDT, three randomized controlled trials (RCT) in brain PD, FGR and PDT were concluded by 2007. The first trial demonstrated that time to tumour progression (TTP) was significantly longer in patients who had PD and FGR compared to standard surgical resection but this difference did not translate into survival advantage in GBM due to the variability in the management of recurrent tumours and significant residual tumour cells left after FGR in about a third of patients leading to GBM relapse. The second trial compared single shot PDT in GBM and standard therapy. Neither the treatment nor the control group received PD or FGR. Again this RCT did not provide any survival advantage in patients who had had PDT due to the fact that standard surgical resection had left significant residual tumour in a large number of patients canceling any potential benefit from PDT. The last trial compared combined PD, FGR and repetitive PDT and standard therapy and confirmed that TTP was significantly longer in the treatment group and demonstrated that the treatment group had significant survival advantage in GBM. In conclusion, PD, FGR and PDT need to be combined to be effective in brain tumours and in the future, we will see more and more scientific evidence accumulating in support of brain PD, FGR and PDT. The next decade will see further refinement and evolution of the techniques and technology employed and expansion of the indications of brain PD, FGR and PDT. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

INTRODUCTION: Early radiotherapy concurrent with chemotherapy appears to have prognostic benefits in patients with limited disease SCLC. Irinotecan/cisplatin have been shown to be superior to a standard treatment with etoposide/cisplatin in extensive disease SCLC. The present phase I study aims to assess the feasibility of irinotecan/cisplatin administered concurrently with radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients were treated concurrently with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (1.8-45 Gy + 9 Gy (RP)) and two cycles of irinotecan (40/50/60 mg/m2, Day 1/8/15, 29/36/43) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2, Days 1-3, 29-31), and four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy (CT). In addition, patients in complete remission (CR) received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any case grade III/IV non-hematological toxicity (esophagitis grade IV), grade IV leukopenia or grades III/IV thrombopenia (CTC) during RCT.RESULTS: No DLT was observed; an irinotecan dose of 60 mg/m2 is recommended. 3/12 patients developed grade III leukopenia, one grade II pneumonitis. The predominant toxicity was esophagitis, grade II in 7/12 patients, grade III in 5/12.

1778,"Renal Function Assessment During Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy. Theranostics labeled with Y-90 or Lu-177 are highly efficient therapeutic approaches for the systemic treatment of various cancers including neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has been used for many years for metastatic or inoperable neuroendocrine tumors. However, renal and hematopoietic toxicities are the major limitations for this therapeutic approach. Kidneys have been considered as the ""critical organ"" because of the predominant glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption by the proximal tubules, and interstitial retention of the tracers. Severe nephrotoxity, which has been classified as grade 4-5 based on the ""Common Terminology Criteria on Adverse Events,"" was reported in the range from 0%-14%. There are several risk factors for renal toxicity; patient-related risk factors include older age, preexisting renal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous nephrotoxic chemotherapy, metastatic lesions close to renal parenchyma, and single kidney. There are also treatment-related issues, such as choice of radionuclide, cumulative radiation dose to kidneys, renal radiation dose per cycle, activity administered, number of cycles, and time interval between cycles. In the literature, nephrotoxicity caused by PRRT was documented using different criteria and renal function tests, from serum creatinine level to more accurate and sophisticated methods. Generally, serum creatinine level was used as a measure of kidney function. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation based on serum creatinine was preferred by several authors. Most commonly used formulas for estimation of GFR are ""Modifications of Diet in Renal Disease"" (MDRD) equation and ""Cockcroft-Gault"" formulas. However, more precise methods than creatinine or creatinine clearance are recommended to assess renal function, such as GFR measurements using Tc-99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), Cr-51-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), or measurement of Tc-99m-MAG3 clearance, particularly in patients with preexisting risk factors for long-term nephrotoxicity. Proximal tubular reabsorption and interstitial retention of tracers result in excessive renal irradiation. Coinfusion of positively charged amino acids, such as l-lysine and l-arginine, is recommended to decrease the renal retention of the tracers by inhibiting the proximal tubular reabsorption. Furthermore, nephrotoxicity may be reduced by dose fractionation. Patient-specific dosimetric studies showed that renal biological effective dose of <0Gy was safe for patients without any risk factors. A renal threshold value <28Gy was recommended for patients with risk factors. Despite kidney protection, renal function impairment can occur after PRRT, especially in patients with risk factors and high single or cumulative renal absorbed dose. Therefore, patient-specific dosimetry may be helpful in minimizing the renal absorbed dose while maximizing the tumor dose. In addition, close and accurate renal function monitoring using more precise methods, rather than plasma creatinine levels, is essential to diagnose the early renal functional changes and to follow-up the renal function during the treatment.",Excluded
37,"Comparison of four scatter correction methods using Monte Carlo simulated source distributions. UNLABELLED: Scatter correction in SPECT is important for improving image quality, boundary detection and the quantification of activity in different regions. This paper presents a comparison of four scatter correction methods, three using more than one energy window and one convolution-subtraction correction method using spatial variant scatter line-spread functions.METHODS: The comparison is based on Monte Carlo simulated data for point sources on- and off-axis, hot and cold spheres of different diameters, and a clinically realistic source distribution simulating brain imaging. All studies were made for a uniform cylindrical water phantom. Since the nature of the detected photon is known with Monte Carlo simulation, separate images of primary and scattered photons can be recorded. These can then be compared with estimated scatter and primary images obtained from the different scatter correction methods. The criteria for comparison were the normalized mean square error, scatter fraction, % recovery and image contrast.RESULTS: All correction methods significantly improved image quality and quantification compared to those obtained with no correction. Quantitatively, no single method was observed to be the best by all criteria for all the source distributions. Three of the methods were observed to perform the best by at least one of the criteria for one of the source distributions. For brain imaging, the differences between all the methods were much less than the difference between them and no correction at all.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that performing scatter correction is essential for accurate quantification, and that all four methods yield a good, but not perfect, scatter correction. Since it is hard to distinguish the methods consistently in terms of their performance, it may be that the choice should be made on the basis of ease of implementation.",Excluded
2149,"A prospective study of thyroid function after radiotherapy for central nervous system and head and neck malignancies. Purpose/Objective: Few studies evaluate endocrine gland function following radiotherapy (RT). We conducted a single-institution prospective study to understand the effect of RT on pituitary and thyroid function in adults. Material(s) and Method(s): Adult patients who received fractionated RT for non-metastatic head and neck cancer and benign intracranial neoplasms were eligible. Patients with a history of thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamic surgery or baseline hormonal supplementation were excluded. Baseline endocrine labs were obtained prior to RT and at 6- month intervals for 5 years. A dose-volume histogram report was generated for the hypothalamus, thyroid, and pituitary gland. Hypothyroidism (HT) was defined as TSH level > 5.0 mIU/L or T4 < 0.8 ng/dL. The primary endpoint was to establish the incidence and threshold dose for RT-related endocrine dysfunction. This interim analysis reports on thyroid function for the first 50 of a planned 200 patients enrolled. Result(s): From October 2006 to May 2008, 50 patients were enrolled with a median follow up of 67 months (range, 17-82 months). Forty-two patients were treated for head and neck (HN) cancers, and eight were treated for benign central nervous (CNS) tumors. No patient was on thyroid supplementation at baseline. The median prescription dose was 6000 cGy in 30 fractions (range, 4500-7000 cGy). Thirty-six patients (72%) were treated adjuvantly and 31 patients (62%) also received concurrent chemotherapy. Primary HT incidence was 60% (n=30) at a median of 12 months (range, 2.9-58.7). The 12-, 24-, 48-, and 60-month freedom from thyroid dysfunction was 78%, 52%, 47.5%, and 33.7%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (42%) received thyroid replacement therapy with a median time to therapy of 3.5 months after diagnosis of HT. The mean thyroid dose in patients with HT was 6136 cGy (range, 3958-6930) compared to 2825 cGy (range, 0-7032) for those without HT. The incidence of HT was 11% (n=2) vs. 87.5% (n=28) for patients with a mean thyroid dose below vs. above 5000 cGy, respectively (p<0.0001). No secondary HT was observed, and the mean pituitary dose for patients with HT was 1065 cGy. Significant risk factors for HT identified on univariate analysis included mean thyroid dose above 5000 cGy <0.0001), concurrent chemotherapy (p=0.029), and HN vs. CNS radiation (p=0.004). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that patients who receive a mean thyroid dose > 5000 cGy are at increased risk for primary HT after RT. Median time to HT is 12 months, but can occur as early as 3 months post- RT. Routine regular laboratory assessment with prompt appropriate thyroid supplementation is recommended.",Excluded
231,"The ketone body s-hydroxybutyrate radiosensitizes glioblastoma multiforme stem cells. Glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) is amalignant brain tumor that typically recurs following standard treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A rare population of radio-chemoresistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) is implicated in tumor repopulation and progression following treatment. Improvement in the prognosis of these patients requires the development of new therapeutic approaches. One emerging strategy is to target aberrant cell metabolism, a trait shared by virtually all tumor cells. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, low carbohydrate and protein metabolic therapy has demonstrated anti-tumor effects alone, and in combination with radiation. The KD prolongs survival in animal glioma models, and when used in conjunction with radiation 9 of 11micewere cured of their implanted tumors. We are now extending this work to determine if the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) radiosensitizes human GSCs in vitro. The effects of betaHB on growth were examined at various betaHB concentrations in two GSC lines, L0andL1. Both 5mM and 10 mM betaHB significantly reduced GSC growth. When coupled with 4Gy of radiation, 5mM betaHB treatment significantly reduced L1 neurosphere formation and frequency, more than either betaHB treatment or radiation alone. In L0, combination treatment significantly reduced neurosphere formation and frequency, more than radiation alone. To explore underlying mechanisms we are investigating the effect of betaHB on DNA damage and repair in GSCs. Additionally, we are determining the effect of betaHB on hypoxia within GSC neurospheres by analyzing expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase 9. We previously showed that the KD reduced the expression of these genes in a mouse glioma model. Taken altogether, these data suggest that betaHB may sensitize GBMs to radiation by inhibiting growth of both glioma cells and GSCs, which may have implications for its use to treat tumor recurrence.",Excluded

Immediately after exposure, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded for 8 h. Sleep architecture was not affected by EMF exposure. Analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a dose-dependent increase of power in the spindle frequency range in non-REM sleep. Reaction speed decelerated with increasing field intensity in the 1-back task, while accuracy in the CRT and N-back task were not affected in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study reveals first indications of a dose-response relationship between EMF field intensity and its effects on brain physiology as demonstrated by changes in the sleep EEG and in cognitive performance.",Excluded

In whole brain, turnover of ACh was decreased after OT independently of the way of killing, but in striatum a decrease was observed only if microwave irradiation was used, which is in contrast to previous findings.

2858,"Radiation-Induced Optic Neuropathy: Clinical and Imaging Profile of Twelve Patients. BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RON) is a form of delayed radionecrosis of the anterior visual pathways, which develops within months to years after external cranial irradiation and causes severe and irreversible vision loss. Small series reports have adequately documented its clinical features, but imaging characteristics have been less completely described.METHODS: We accrued cases from the University of Michigan Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic files and from cases coded as ""radiation optic neuropathy"" at the University of Michigan Medical Center between 1994 and 2017. All patients had undergone 3D-conformal linear accelerator (photon) external beam radiation. We collected clinical details of vision loss, including the temporal relationship to radiation. A single neuroradiologist (E.A.L.) evaluated all available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, noting the presence of enhancement, expansion, or volume loss of the optic nerves or chiasm, corresponding T2 signal abnormalities, and the absence of demyelination or confounding compressive lesions.RESULTS: Twelve patients (15 eyes) met inclusion criteria. Vision loss was usually monocular at outset, but both optic nerves were eventually involved in 3 (25%) patients. Although usually sudden in onset, vision loss often declined slowly over many months, frequently to finger counting, or worse without recovery. An afferent pupillary defect was always present at the time of presentation. Most affected optic discs were pale at the time of first visual symptoms, indicating that subclinical optic nerve damage had been present for several weeks. The latency from completion of radiation to onset of vision loss ranged from 7 to 48 months (average: 18 months). In 2 patients, radiation was delivered to the whole brain, rather than being limited to the anterior visual pathway. MRI typically displayed a discrete region of enhancement of the affected prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with expansion and high T2 signal in the enhancing segment. In 3 affected eyes, enhancement was apparent on imaging completed 3-6 weeks before the onset of vision loss. In one patient, segmental prechiasmatic enhancement became evident only on repeat MRI completed 7 months after vision loss. The duration of enhancement among 9 eyes with follow-up MRIs was at least 2 months, but in one case, enhancement was still present on a study performed 17 months after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This study further delineates the profile of RON. Visual loss is often acute, profound, and monocular but may decline slowly after acute onset and later affect both optic nerves. High-resolution MRI of the optic nerves usually will display enhancement of a discrete segment of the intracranial prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with accompanying expansion and T2 hyperintensity. In some cases, these imaging features may precede vision loss. They may be subtle or appear after vision loss. Enhancement lingers for a wide interval, ranging in this study from 2 to at least 17 months. Recognition of these imaging characteristics assists in confirmation of the diagnosis of RON.",Excluded

MRI showed an enhanced intramedullary lesion with extensive edema in the cervical spinal cord. Radiation myelitis, intramedullary spinal tumor, and neurosarcoidosis were considered as differential diagnoses. Spinal cord biopsy with laminectomy was performed and radiation myelitis was diagnosed.

Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with oligometastatic brain disease are typically treated with SRS +/- tumor resection (with whole brain radiation [WBXRT] reserved for refractory cases). There exist no data regarding the local control benefits (if any) of surgery prior to SRS. Materials/Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all patients undergoing SRS with or without prior tumor excision at our institution. No patient had received prior WBXRT. Factors related to patient survival were determined by Cox regression; time-torecurrence (TTR) was analyzed similarly but with robust residuals to account for clustering. Non-progressing tumors which received WBXRT (for another progressing tumor) were censored at time of WBXRT. There were 162 patients identified (82/80 M/F, average 65.3), with a total of 260 tumors, of which 119 were solitary. Although surgical patients were younger, had better performance status and less burden of disease compared to SRS alone, none of these differences were statistically significant, although the RPA class was significantly better in the SRS+ surgery group (p = .003, Mann-Whitney). Forty-nine patients had a total of 51 tumors resected (2 patients with 2 resected), of which 33 were solitary. Complete resection, as determined by 24-hour contrasted MRI, was achieved in 45 (88%). A total of 73 tumors (28%) in 45 patients were considered to have locally progressed, 20 of which had previously undergone resection.

Survival by RPA class was 26.9, 8.7, and 1.5 for classes 1-3, respectively (p = .0004, log-rank). Median TTR was 14.8 months for all tumors, with TTR for complete resection + SRS, incomplete resection + SRS and SRS alone at 22.5, 6.4, and 14.8 months respectively (p = .004, log-rank). In the stepwise Cox regression analysis, overall survival was related to age (HR = 1.02, p = 0.037), ECOG performance score (HR = 1.9, p = 0.0001) and complete surgical excision (HR = .55, p = 0.01). Analysis of TTR demonstrated the following significantly related factors: radiation sensitive pathology (non-renal or melanoma) (HR = 0.367, p = 0.01), tumor size (HR = 1.43, p = 0.0012), and complete tumor resection (HR = 0.348, p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Although complete surgical excision + SRS are associated with prolonged survival, results may be skewed due to selection bias. TTR represents an unbiased estimate of the effect of surgery and shows SRS alone is associated with a 3 times increased likelihood of recurrence over complete resection + SRS, even when controlling for lesion size and pathology. Incomplete resection did not improve survival or TTR compared to SRS alone.",Excluded
2866,"Human glycine alpha1 receptor inhibition by quercetin is abolished or inversed by alpha267 mutations in transmembrane domain 2. Quercetin, one of the flavonoids, is a compound of low molecular weight found in fruits and vegetables. Besides its antioxidative effect, quercetin also shows a wide range of diverse neuropharmacological actions. However, the cellular mechanisms of quercetin's actions, especially on ligand-gated ion channels and synaptic transmissions, are not well studied. We investigated the effect of quercetin on the human glycine alpha1 receptor channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Application of quercetin reversibly inhibited glycine-induced current (I(Gly)). Quercetin's inhibition depends on its dose, with an IC(50) of 21.5+/-.2 microM. The inhibition was sensitive to membrane voltages. Site-directed mutations of S267 to S267Y but not S267A, S267F, S267G, S267K, S267L and S267T at transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) nearly abolished quercetin-induced inhibition of I(Gly). In contrast, in site-directed mutant receptors such as S267 to S267I, S267R and S267V, quercetin enhanced I(Gly) compared to the wild-type receptor. The EC(50) was 22.6+/-1.4, 25.5+/-4.2, and 14.5+/-3.1 microM for S267I, S267R and S267V, respectively. These results indicate that quercetin might regulate the human glycine alpha(1) receptor via interaction with amino acid residue alpha267 and that alpha267 plays a key role in determining the regulatory consequences of the human glycine alpha1 receptor by quercetin.",Excluded
2369,Late neoplastic complications after radiation treatments for benign intracranial tumors. There is increasing interest in the use of radiation treatment as an adjunct or an alternative to microsurgery in the management of a range of intracranial tumors. Most of these treatments are performed with linear accelerator or Gamma Knife systems. Precise targeting with stereotactic localization minimizes the volume of tissue being irradiated for single and multiple fraction irradiation. The incidence of secondary neoplasms after radiosurgery may be significantly less than that reported after whole-brain or two- or three-field radiotherapy. [References: 19],Excluded

2509,"Effects of oxygen and bFGF on the vulnerability of photoreceptors to light damage. PURPOSE: To test whether tissue oxygen levels affect the vulnerability of photoreceptors to damage by bright continuous light (BCL).METHODS: Albino rats were raised in standard conditions of cyclic light (12-hour light, 12-hour darkness) with the light level at 5 to 10 lux or 40 to 65 lux. They were then exposed to BCL (1000-1400 lux), either continuously for 48 hours or for the day or night components of the 48-hour period. During BCL, some rats were kept in room air (normoxia, 21% oxygen), some in hypoxia (10%), and some in hyperoxia (70%). Their retinas were examined for cell death, for the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and for response to light (electroretinogram, ERG).RESULTS: The death of retinal cells induced by BCL was confined to photoreceptors. Within the retina, the severity of death was inversely related to the level of bFGF immunolabeling in the somas of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) before exposure. The death of photoreceptors was accompanied by an upregulation of bFGF protein levels in the ONL and by a decline in the ERG. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia during BCL reduced the photoreceptor death, bFGF upregulation, and ERG decline caused by BCL. The protective effects of hyperoxia and hypoxia were evident during both the day and night halves of the daily cycle. Hypoxia or hyperoxia alone did not upregulate bFGF or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) expression in the retina.CONCLUSIONS: Photoreceptors are protected from light damage by hypoxia and hyperoxia during exposure. The protection provided by oxygen levels operates during both day and night. The protection is not mediated by an upregulation of bFGF or CNTF.",Excluded
2579,"Carbenoxolone impairs LTP and blocks NMDA receptors in murine hippocampus. Effects of the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) on tetanus- and taurine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied on Schaffer collateral-CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in mouse hippocampal slices. Preincubation with 10 microM CBX reduced the amount of LTP induced by weak theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or a single train of stimuli (HFS; 1s at 100 Hz), but did not affect LTP induced by 30-min perfusion with 10 mM taurine. Incubation with 50-100 microM CBX 15 min before HFS or TBS abolished tetanus-induced LTP. At 100 microM CBX, the concentration that is used for the blockade of gap junctions in vitro, a long-lasting depression of fEPSPs was observed which persisted under the blockade of NMDA receptors, and receptors for corticosteroids. A similar depression was produced by the CBX inactive analogue glycyrrhizic acid and the broad spectrum calcium channel antagonist ruthenium red. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that CBX exerts a selective dose-dependent inhibition of NMDA-evoked currents with an IC(50)=104 microM. Thus the widely used gap junction uncoupler CBX acts as an antagonist at NMDA receptors and consequently impairs the induction of LTP.",Excluded
3474,"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated is not required for p53 induction and apoptosis in irradiated epithelial tissues. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (Atm) protein kinase is a central regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage. Although Atm can regulate p53, it is not known if this Atm function varies between tissues. Previous studies showed that the induction of p53 and apoptosis by whole-body ionizing radiation varies greatly between tissue and tumor types, so here we asked if Atm also had a tissue-specific role in the ionizing radiation response. Irradiated Atm-null mice showed impaired p53 induction and apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and brain. In contrast, radiation-induced p53, apoptosis, phosphorylation of Chk2, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest were slightly delayed in Atm(-/-) epithelial cells of the small intestine but reached wild-type levels by 4 h. Radiation-induced p53 and apoptosis in Atm(-/-) hair follicle epithelial cells were not impaired at any of the time points examined. Thus, Atm is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues but is largely dispensable in epithelial cells. This indicates that marked differences in DNA damage signaling pathways exist between tissues, which could explain some of the tissue-specific phenotypes, especially tumor suppression, associated with Atm deficiency.",Excluded

Survival outcome of 1592 analyzable patients on four Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) studies in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer were studied utilizing a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). This approach creates a regression tree according to prognostic variables which partitions into homogenous subsets according to survival. Four protocols, RTOG 83-11, 83-21, 84-03 and 84-07 were analyzed. 83-11 and 84-07 were studies utilizing irradiation with 'alterfractionation; 83-21 and 84-03 were studies evaluating thymocin with irradiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation with thoracic irradiation respectively. Nine pretreatment variables and one treatment variable were analyzed. Adjustment for radiotherapy effect was made in the accelerated treatment protocol (84-07). Overall, median survival for the entire group was 9.0 months with 17% alive at 2 years. Univariate analysis suggests that KPS, <=70 vs. 80-100, pleural effusion, weight loss, <=5% vs. 5%, age, 60 + vs. < 60, T stage (T1 and T2 vs. T3 and T4) and N stage (N- vs. N +) were important prognastic factors. Radiation dose, sex, race and histology were not univariate prognastic factors. RPA identified KPS as the most significant covariate (median survival 5.9 mos. <= 70 vs. 9.9 mos. 80-100). Within KPS 80-100 other splits occurred for N stage, age, weight loss and radiation therapy dose. KPS 170 split at pleural effusion only. The best overall RPA tree has four distinct classes with median survival times ranging from 3.3 to 12.6 months. The RPA classes were validated in an independent non-small cell lung cancer dataset. This analysis may allow more intelligent stratification and study-design for future RTOG trials in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer.",Excluded
1274,"Assembly of actin-containing cortex occurs at distal regions of growing neurites in PC12 cells. Although actin filaments are known to be localized in the cortex of axons and in the growth cones of nerve cells, it is unclear how actin-containing structures are assembled during nerve growth. We have studied the formation of actin structures in growing neurites by microinjecting fluorescent phalloidin or actin into PC12 neuron-like cells to label endogenous actin filaments. Upon stimulation of neurite growth in cells microinjected with fluorescent phalloidin, little or no fluorescence was detected in nascent growth cones and adjacent neurites despite the presence of actin filaments in these regions, suggesting that actin filaments were primarily formed by de novo assembly rather than the transport and reorganization of pre-existing, phalloidin-labeled actin filaments. Time-lapse observations of the distribution of phalloidin-labeled actin filaments during neurite elongation confirmed that fluorescence associated with pre-existing neurite cortex spread out more slowly than the elongation of neurites. Furthermore, when a dark spot was photobleached with a laser microbeam along neurites of cells microinjected with either fluorescent phalloidin or actin, the spot showed no appreciable translocation during active neurite elongation. Taken together, these results suggest that de novo assembly of actin filaments plays a crucial role in the formation of growth cones and adjacent cortex in the distal region of neurites, but does not appear to require the anterograde or retrograde transport of cortical filaments, or the passive stretching of the proximal segment of the neurite cortex.",Excluded
1042,"Dosimetric comparison of helical tomotherapy treatment plans for total marrow irradiation created using GPU and CPU dose calculation engines. PURPOSE: To compare optimization characteristics, plan quality, and treatment delivery efficiency between total marrow irradiation (TMI) plans using the new TomoTherapy graphic processing unit (GPU) based dose engine and CPU/cluster based dose engine.METHODS: Five TMI plans created on an anthropomorphic phantom were optimized and calculated with both dose engines. The planning treatment volume (PTV) included all the bones from head to mid femur except for upper extremities. Evaluated organs at risk (OAR) consisted of lung, liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. The following treatment parameters were used to generate the TMI plans: field widths of 2.5 and 5 cm, modulation factors of 2 and 2.5, and pitch of either 0.287 or 0.43. The optimization parameters were chosen based on the PTV and OAR priorities and the plans were optimized with a fixed number of iterations. The PTV constraint was selected to ensure that at least 95% of the PTV received the prescription dose. The plans were evaluated based on D80 and D50 (dose to 80% and 50% of the OAR volume, respectively) and hotspot volumes within the PTVs. Gamma indices (GAMMA) were also used to compare planar dose distributions between the two modalities. The optimization and dose calculation times were compared between the two systems. The treatment delivery times were also evaluated.RESULTS: The results showed very good dosimetric agreement between the GPU and CPU calculated plans for any of the evaluated planning parameters indicating that both systems converge on nearly identical plans. All D80 and D50 parameters varied by less than 3% of the prescription dose with an average difference of 0.8%. A gamma analysis GAMMA(3%, 3 mm) < 1 of the GPU plan resulted in over 90% of calculated voxels satisfying GAMMA < 1 criterion as compared to baseline CPU plan. The average number of voxels meeting the GAMMA < 1 criterion for all the plans was 97%. In terms of dose optimization/calculation efficiency, there was a 20-fold reduction in planning time with the new GPU system. The average optimization/dose calculation time utilizing the traditional CPU/cluster based system was 579 vs 26.8 min for the GPU based system. There was no difference in the calculated treatment delivery time per fraction. Beam-on time varied based on field width and pitch and ranged between 15 and 28 min.CONCLUSIONS: The TomoTherapy GPU based dose engine is capable of calculating TMI treatment plans with plan quality nearly identical to plans calculated using the traditional CPU/cluster based system, while significantly reducing the time required for optimization and dose calculation.",Excluded
100,"Charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular malformations. Heavy charged-particle radiation has unique physical characteristics that offer several advantages over photons and protons for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial AVMs. These include improved dose distributions with depth in tissue, small angle of lateral scattering, and sharp distal fall-off of dose in the Bragg ionization peak. Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded
3380,"Contour variability during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment planning and the effect of physician training. Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate inter- and intra-observer contouring variability during treatment planning for stage I lung cancers treated with SBRT, and to assess the effect of contouring training for physicians. Materials/Methods: Nine radiation oncologists (3 attendings, 6 residents) contoured the lung tumor internal target volumes (ITVs) in 6 patients using maximum intensity projection (MIP) images after 4D-CT simulation. Contouring was performed independently at 3 separate time points: prior to training based on department standards, after completing contouring training, and >2 weeks after the second session. Contouring variability was evaluated for variations in the magnitude of volumes (coefficient of variation (COV) = standard deviation/mean volume), the volume overlap (conformality index (CI) = common volume/encompassing volume), and differences in the centroid location. Contours were also compared clinically to determine radiographic features resulting in larger disagreement. Result(s): The mean volumes in cm3 for session 1, 2 and 3 were 6.52, 6.98 and 7.20 respectively. The mean COV for sessions 1 (0.25 +/- 0.05), 2 (0.24 +/- 0.04) and 3 (0.19 +/- 0.03) demonstrated significant improvement from session 1 to 3 (p = 0.03) while the CI also improved with each session, 0.35 +/-0.07, 0.36 +/-0.03 and 0.44 +/-0.04, respectively (p = 0.03 from session 1 to 3). Average differences (mm) of the mean centroid positions in the lateral, anterior-posterior, and cranial-caudal directions demonstrated decreased variability from session 1, 0.3+/-0.3, 0.3+/-0.3 and 0.5+/-0.5, to session 3, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.3+/-0.3 respectively (p = ns). Differences in resident vs. attending COV 0.31+/-0.06 vs. 0.09+/-0.05 (p<0.001) and CI 0.37+/-0.08 vs. 0.69+/-0.03 (p<0.001) for session 1 and COV 0.20+/-0.04 vs. 0.19+/-0.05 (p = 0.78) and CI 0.50+/-0.05 vs. 0.63+/-0.05 (p = 0.002) for session 3 demonstrated training improved resident contouring towards attending levels.

Conclusion(s): While there is large variation in contoured volumes, the centroid locations show excellent agreement. Intra- is smaller than interobserver variability; both can be improved with repeat contouring and standardized training, particularly in less experienced observers. Clinically, variability was most relevant for lesions with pleural attachments and spiculae suggesting a need for a standardized approach to contour such lesions.",Excluded

Purpose: In malignant gliomas, invasive phenotype and cancer stemness promoting resurgence of residual tumor cells, render treatment very difficult. Hence, identification of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors associated with invasion and stemness of glioma cells is critical. Method(s): To address the issue, we investigated several EMT factors in hypermotile U87MG and U251 cells, mouse xenograft model, and human glioma samples. Of several EMT markers, SLUG expression was notably increased at the invasive fronts of gliomas, both in mouse tumor xenografts and human glioma samples. The biological role played by SLUG was investigated using a colony-forming assay after chemotherapy and irradiation, and by employing a neurosphere culture assay. The effect of SLUG on glioma progression was examined in our patient cohort and samples, and compared to large public data from the REMBRANDT and TCGA. Result(s): Genetic upregulation of SLUG was associated with increased levels of stemness factors and enhanced resistance to radiation and temozolomide. In our cohort, patients exhibiting lower-level SLUG expression evidenced longer progression-free survival (P=0.042). Also, in the REMBRANDT dataset, a group in which SLUG was downregulated exhibited a significant survival benefit (P<0.001). Although paired gliblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples from our patients did not showed significant increase of SLUG expression, increased mRNA levels of SLUG was found in recurred GBM from TCGA (P=0.052), and in TMZ-treated glioma cells and mouse xenograft.

Data were collected from April 2016 to May 2017. The patients were clinically evaluated with regard to stimulated salivary flow, trismus, and radiation caries. Sociodemographic data and data related to the disease (stage, location of primary tumor, and radiation dose) were collected from the patient charts. Quality of life was assessed using the Brazilian version of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire. Poisson logistic regression was performed to determine the mean ratio and test associations with the clinical and sociodemographic variables.RESULTS: The mean total of the UW-QOL was 814.88 (+/- 224.58).

PURPOSE: To analyze the factors that affect survival in patients with brain metastases (BM) from breast cancer who were treated with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 116 women with breast cancer who were treated with WBRT alone between February 1984 and September 2000. All patients had treatment and follow-up data available in their medical charts, which we extracted for this retrospective study. We evaluated a number of potential predictors of survival after WBRT: age, primary tumor stage, control of primary tumor, presence of other systemic metastases, site of systemic metastases, Karnofsky performance status, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis class, total dose of WBRT, and number of BM. Eighteen patients received a total dose >3000 cGy and 7 received a partial brain boost.RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the median survival from the start of WBRT was 4.2 months.

2978,"Prevalence of abnormal brain CT scan finding in patients with headache: Two year study in Imam Hospital. [Arabic]. Background: Headache is one of the most common problems that bring patients to doctors' offices. Many physicians order neuroimaging studies after taking the history of the patient and performing a physical examination. These neuroimaging studies are often requested due to the probable existence of an intracranial lesion. However, at times they are requested to allay the fears of patients or even doctors. Most of these studies are normal and the question arises whether there is any indication for requesting neuroimaging studies for a patient with an isolated headache. Method(s): We studied 146 patients with headache who had been referred for CT scan to the imaging center of Imam Khomeini Hospital during 2004-2005. For each patient, a questionnaire, including the medical history and accompanying neurological symptoms, was filled out and CT scan results were gathered. Result(s): The mean of age of the patients was 37.8 years, and 69% were female. Only 10 patients (6.8%) had a brain lesion in the CT scan. Accompanying neurological symptoms were more frequent in patients with abnormal rather than normal CT scans. There was a meaningful correlation between abnormal CT scan and paresthesia, ptosis, paresia, diplopia, visual loss, convulsion, vomiting and vertigo. A statistical correlation existed between gender and positive CT scan. Conclusion(s): Many patients with headache have normal brain CT scan results. Thus, better criteria are warranted for requesting neuroimaging including accurate patient history and neurological examination in order to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure. MRI instead of Cr scan would be a better first step toward the evaluation of the possible existence of brain lesions.",Excluded

Objectives The inducible GPCR B1 receptor (B1R) is a molecular signature of several types of solid cancers, including brain cancer. It is thought to be involved in tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis. Thus, the B1R may represent a highly promising new target for the development of cancer-targeted theranostic agents Methods We developed a new 64Cu/NOTA-conjugated analog of our potent, selective B1R peptide antagonist, R-954 (AcOrn[Oic2,(alphaMe)Phe5,DbetaNal7,Ile8]-desArg9-bradykinin). Stability of the resulting peptide conjugate was evaluated ex vivo in undiluted rat blood samples and in vivo within systemic circulation in healthy rats. Intracellular uptake/nuclear localization and radiocytotoxicity of the conjugate were studied in cultured F98 glioma cells. In vivo biodistribution profile and efficacy of detection of malignant brain tumors by PET, were evaluated using the syngeneic, orthotopic F98 glioma rat model Results 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 showed remarkable stability in rat plasma after a 24h incubation. In vivo stability study showed mainly intact radiolabeled peptide (no occurrence of radiotracer metabolites) in rat blood circulation and urine, 90min after tail-vein injection. In vitro, the conjugate supressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, clonogenic growth of F98 cells possibly through an intracellular radiation mechanism (i.e. via cellular/nuclear uptake). Intravenous 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 properly detected relatively small brain tumors by PET at 1.5h and 20h after injection. Moreover, muPET signals coincided perfectly with those of contrast-enhanced MRI. The conjugate exhibited high tumor-to-contralateral background uptake and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios (18:1 and 6:1, respectively) at 20h after injection. muPET signals generated by the radiotracer were i) inhibitable with excess of the unlabeled B1R antagonist R-954, ii) substantially reduced in B1R-knockdown F98 tumors, and iii) primarily absent in sham-operated animals, thus confirming the B1R-targeted tumor uptake specificity of the conjugate Conclusions Our findings provide initial proof-of-concept for the potential use of 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 radiotracer in both diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer, and possibly other types of B1R-positive solid cancers.",Excluded

362,"Merkel cell carcinoma: recent progress and current priorities on etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical management. PURPOSE: To expedite improved understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare malignancy of cutaneous neuroendocrine cells that has a 28% 2-year mortality rate.METHODS: This article summarizes a workshop that discussed the state-of-the-art research and priorities for research on MCC and on a new human polyomavirus (ie, MCPyV) recently discovered in 80% of MCC tumors.RESULTS: Normal Merkel cells are widely distributed in the epidermis near the end of nerve axons and may function as mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors. Malignant MCC cells typically stain for cytokeratin 20 as well as for other epithelial and neuroendocrine markers. MCC subtypes, which are based on histology, on cell line growth properties, and on gene expression profiles, have been reported but have not been linked to prognosis. Clinical management has been empiric. MCPyV is clonally integrated at various sites in the human genome of MCC tumors, with truncating mutations in the viral, large T antigen gene that interrupt viral replication. MCPyV seroprevalence may be high, as with previously known human polyomaviruses. MCC risk is increased 11-fold with AIDS and with other cell-mediated immune deficiencies, B-cell neoplasms, and ultraviolet radiation exposure.CONCLUSION: Development and validation of a range quantitative polymerase chain reaction and serologic assays for detection of MCPyV, as well as an infectious clone of the virus, would clarify the fundamental biology, natural history, and epidemiology of the virus, of MCC, and of other diseases. Contingent on standardized histologic diagnosis and staging of MCC, consortia are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant radiation therapy, and salvage therapies; consortia are needed also for epidemiologic studies of MCC etiology.

177,"Role of 11C-Methionine PET/CT for radiotherapy Planning of patients affected by Primary Brain Tumour. Purpose: 11C-MET is a radiolabelled aminoacid successfully utilized in PET imaging of primary and metastatic brain tumours. So far, very limited evidence concerns its utilization for radiotherapy planning. Thus the aim of our study is that to investigate its role in patients affected by rimary brain tumours in this clinical setting. Method(s): we enrolled 21 patients (M:F=14:8; mean age 53.2yrs) affected by a histologically proven primary/relapsed gliomas, who were addressed to our Institution for radiotherapy. Almost half of them (10/21) had already been treated and presented during relapse. In all cases dedicated MR, CT and MET-PET were scheduled before treatment and performed according to standard procedures. GTV was outlined on CT images fused to MR (GTV-MRI/CT), on MET-PET positive regions only (GTV-PET), and final volumes were calculated by using PET/CT/MRI coregistered images. Optimal radiation dose required was 60Gy. In 7 patients a contemporary Chemo/radiotherapy regimen was administered. The mean observational period was 6months, up to 22months. In 13 patients a postradiotherapy evaluation was performed and of these we calculated PFS and OS. In 3 patients progression/relapse was defined within 7 months, whereas other 3 patients deceased within 2 months. Statistical analysis was performed on clinical and instrumental data in order to define correlation and prognostic value of different parameters. Result(s): in19 out of 21 patients a GTV-PET could be defined (mean 18,3cc), which in 14 cases (73,7%) determined a modification of the GTVMRI/ CT (mean 58.79cc). Malignant lesions presented a SUV<inf>max</inf>=3.37 (range1.60- 5.17) and a SUVratio(SUV<inf>max</inf>/SUVnormal)=2.43 (range1.53-3.26). There was a significant correlation between tumour grade and SUV<inf>max</inf> (p<0,0001). In 10/21 cases the tumour was multifocal, of which 3/10 bilateral. The overall volume change, according MET-PET, was 139,58cc (mean 6,65cc), corresponding to 11,2% of total GTV. The ROC-analysis defined an optimal SUV<inf>max</inf> cut-off point<=2,7 (Sens.100%; Spec.90%), whereas for SUVratio<=1,73 (Sens.100%; Spec.81,3%). Univariate analysis on PFS documented a significant correlation for SUV<inf>max</inf> cut-off (p=0,0077) and SUVratio cut-off (p=0,0301), but not for tumour grade (p=0,7961), previous relapses (p=0,1573), tumour multifocality (p=0,5271) and concomitant chemo/radiotherapy (p=0,5749).

244,"Epidemiology of intracranial meningioma. Intracranial meningiomas arise from the meninges and typically have benign histologic findings. They constitute approximately 20% of all intracranial tumors. Their incidence increases with age, and they affect women more commonly than men. The annual incidence per 100,000 people ranges from two to seven for women and from one to five for men. Since the first study was published in 1970, only eight major epidemiologic studies have been done that attempted to identify risk factors for meningioma. Ionizing radiation and head trauma have emerged as the most promising etiologic risk factors. In these studies, radiation doses as low as 1-2 Gy have been associated with increased risk. The role of dental radiographs has been suggested in some studies but not supported in others. An explanation for the apparent excess of meningiomas in women remains obscure. The potential effects of endogenous or exogenous sex hormones on tumor induction or growth remain unexplored in epidemiologic studies. More should be learned about the risk factors for meningioma in search of opportunities for prevention. [References: 87]",Excluded

870,"Equivalent outcomes with hypofractionated, accelerated thoracic radiation therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Does this represent a reasonable strategy in patients unable to attend twice daily treatment?. Purpose/Objective(s): The publication of RTOG 8815 established hyperfractionated, twice-daily thoracic radiation therapy (BID RT) with concurrent platinum-etoposide (PE) as the standard of care in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, many patients with this aggressive, often debilitating malignancy find BID RT intolerable due to both physical and logistical limitations. As an alternative, patients unable to receive BID RT are treated with daily 3Gy fractions (QD RT) to a total dose of 45Gy at our institution.We hypothesized that hypofractionated QD RT in the setting of concurrent PE would be as safe and effective as BID RT. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with LS-SCLC treated with curative intent. Patients received 45Gy either QD (3Gy) or BID (1.5Gy) with concurrent PE. Covariables reviewed include age, gender, race, insurance status, year of diagnosis, 3D vs IMRT planning, PTV volume, chemotherapy agents and cycles, RT dose and fractionation, incidence of Grade >=2 radiation pneumonitis and subsequent delivery of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare the characteristics of treatment groups for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were generated, with accompanying univariate (UVA) log-rank and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-six patients were evaluable, with a median follow-up of 13 months for the entire cohort (range 3-79), and a median follow-up of 18.5 months for survivors (range 7-73). 88% of patients were deceased at last follow-up. For the entire cohort, median age was 63 years (range 54-81). 24 (67%) patients received BID RT; 12 (33%) received QD RT. BID and QD groups were balanced with respect to age, race, sex, insurance status, PTV volume, and 3D vs IMRT planning. One patient in each group was treated with corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. No significant differences were observed for PFS or OS outcomes. 2-year PFS was 13.4% (BID) vs 16.7% (QD) (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-1.67; p<.61) and 2-year OS was 34.5% (BID) vs 31.7% (QD) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.28-1.86; p<.51). Neither the incidence of Grade >= 2 radiation pneumonitis (p=0.61) nor utilization of PCI (BID 58% vs 50% QD, p=0.64) differed between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In this single-institution study, hypofractionated QD RT to 45Gy delivered with concurrent PE was associated with toxicity and outcomes comparable to BID RT with concurrent PE. Further validation with a larger, prospective dataset is warranted. Daily hypofractionated thoracic RT with concurrent chemotherapy represents a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot be treated twice daily.",Excluded
2339,"Non-coplanar VMAT plans for postoperative primary brain tumour to reduce dose to hippocampus, temporal lobe and cochlea: a planning study. Objectives: This study aimed to compare radiotherapy plan quality of coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (CO-VMAT) and non-coplanar VMAT (NC-VMAT) for post-operative primary brain tumour.Methods: A total of 16 patients who were treated for primary brain tumours were retrospectively selected for this study. For each patient, identical CT sets with structures were used for both CO-VMAT and NC-VMAT planning. For CO-VMAT, one full arc and two coplanar half arcs were used. For NC-VMAT, one full coplanar and two non-coplanar half arcs with couch rotation of 315degree or 45degree were used. Dose constraints were adhered to the RTOG 0614, RTOG 0933 and TMH protocol. Dose volumetric parameters were collected for statistical analysis.Results: .NC-VMAT achieved significant dose reduction in contralateral hippocampus, both temporal lobes and cochleae, and other OARs while the plan qualities remained the same. In particular, NC-VMAT decreased contralateral hippocampus mean dose by 1.67Gy. Similarly, the NC-VMAT decreased temporal lobe mean dose by 6.29Gy and 2.8Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively. Furthermore, it decreased cochlea mean dose by 5.34Gy and 0.97Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively. Overall, there was a reduction of 5.4% of normal brain tissue volume receiving low dose irradiation.Conclusion: The proposed NC-VMAT showed more favourable plan quality than the CO-VMAT for primary brain tumours, in particular to hippocampus, temporal lobes, cochleae and OARs located to the contralateral side of tumours.Advances in knowledge: For primary brain tumours radiotherapy, NC-VMAT can reduce doses to the hippocampus, both temporal lobes, and cochleae, as well as OARs located to the contralateral side of tumours.",Excluded

Between 1962 and 1986, 32 patients with intracranial meningiomas were referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy for external radiotherapy either after incomplete surgery, or unfavorable histology (meningiosarcoma/anaplastic meningioma), or after recurrences. In the latter case, the mean time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence was 2 years (range: 1-6 years). Radiotherapy was performed using photons, electrons or mixed phetons-electrons. The mean total dose was 48 Gy (range: 9-65 Gy) delivered in a mean time of 35 days with a 19 mean number of fractions. Radiotherapy was interrupted in three cases at 9 Gy-17 Gy-20 Gy because of neurological worsening. The actuarial 5-year survival was 64%.

Only one factor was evidenced as of significant value on the recurrence as well as the 10-year survival: the total dose of irradiation with a 10-year survival rate of 74% for total doses higher than or equal to 47 Gy versus 14% when the total dose was lower than 47 Gy.",Excluded
688,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant glioblastomas demonstrate a decreased rate of pseudoprogression: A multi-institutional experience. Background: Pseudoprogression (psPD) represents false radiologic evidence of tumor progression and is observed in some glioblastoma (GBM) patients after postoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with temozolomide (TMZ). The ambiguity of the psPD diagnosis confounds identification of true progression and may lead to unnecessary interventions. The association between psPD and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational (mut) status is understudied, and its incidence may alter clinical decision making. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 120 patients with IDH1-mut (n = 60) and IDH1-wild-type (IDH-WT; [n = 60]) GBMs who received postoperative CRT with TMZ at 4 academic institutions. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to identify psPD rates in routine brain MRIs performed up to 90 days after CRT completion. Result(s): Within 90 days of completing CRT, 9 GBM patients (1 [1.7%] IDH1-mut and 8 [13.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated true progression, whereas 17 patients (3 [5%] IDH1-muts and 14 [23.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated psPD (P =. 004). IDH1-mut GBMs had a lower probability of psPD (hazard ratio: 0.173, 95% CI, 0.047-0.638, P =. 008). Among the patients with radiologic signs suggestive of progression (n = 26), psPD was found to be the cause in 3 of 4 (75.0%) of the IDH1-mut GBMs and 14 of 22 (63.6%) of the IDH1-WT GBMs (P =. 496). Median overall survival for IDH1-mut and IDH1-WT GBM patients was 40.3 and 23.0 months, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion(s): IDH1-mut GBM patients demonstrate lower absolute rates of psPD expression. Irrespective of GBM subtype, psPD expression was more likely than true progression within 90 days of completing CRT. Continuing adjuvant treatment for IDH1-mut GBMs is suggested if radiologic progression is suspected during this time interval. Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Background: Craniopharyngiomas are histologically benign but locally aggressive epithelial tumors of the sellar and suprasellar regions, which are often adherent to critical neurovascular structures. Herein, we describe our evolving surgical management of these complex tumors which continue to pose a formidable challenge for safe removal and long-term management. Method(s): All patients undergoing craniopharyngioma resection by the main author over an 18-year period were reviewed. Demographics, tumor location and characteristics, surgical approach, adjuvant therapy, complications, visual and endocrine outcomes, symptom improvement, and tumor control rates were collected. Special attention was given to the evolution of operative approach and surgical technique, over the course of our experience. Result(s): From 2000 to 2017, a total of 58 patients (mean age: 44 years, 44% female) underwent 70 surgeries for craniopharyngioma resection; 32 (46%) of the surgeries were re-resections for recurrent or residual tumor. The surgical approaches included endonasal microscopic (6%), endonasal endoscopic-assisted (37%), fully endoscopic (37%), and supraorbital (20%). Since 2011, all patients undergoing a transsphenoidal resection utilized a fully endoscopic approach. Preoperative endocrinopathy was present in 79% of all cases. Postoperatively, one patient had a complete hormonal recovery, 36 (51%) patients had stable endocrinopathy, and 20 (29%) patients had worsened hormonal function. Of 15 patients without preoperative endocrinopathy, none experienced new postoperative hormonal dysfunction. Regarding vision, improvement was seen in 94% of 48 patients with preoperative visual dysfunction, greatest with first-time and fully endoscopic cases, while 2 patients had stable vision, and 1 experienced a postoperative homonymous hemianopia from a posterior cerebral artery spasm and subsequent stroke. Overall, 60% of patients had complete or near-complete resection, including 74% of first-time resections and 65% of all fully endoscopic cases. By surgical approach, complete/near-complete removal was accomplished in 63, 73, and 29% of microscopic and endoscope-assisted cases combined (n=30), fully endoscopic cases (n=26), and supraorbital cases (n=16), respectively. Regarding skull base reconstruction and CSF leak repair in the endonasal cohort, postoperative CSF leaks were 14% in the microscopic and endoscope-assisted cohort (n=30), and 8% in the fully endoscopic cohort (n=26). Of the fully endoscopic cohort, 21 of 26 (81%) were repaired with a nasoseptal flap with one failure (5%) and one case of meningitis. Of 38 patients undergoing first-time surgery (20 fully endoscopic, 14 endoscope-assisted, 4 supraorbital), 50% received postoperative radiation (stereotactic radiotherapy n=18 and SRS n=1). Of these 19 patients, 3 (16%) required additional surgery for tumor control. Conclusion(s): Most craniopharyngiomas are optimally treated by the endonasal endoscopic approach. For recurrent craniopharyngiomas, the supraorbital route is a complimentary minimally invasive alternative that is ideal in many patients, providing excellent access, especially with endoscopic assistance. The goals of craniopharyngioma surgery should be an optimal functional outcome, focusing on visual recovery and hormonal functional preservation if possible. There remains a significant role for stereotactic radiotherapy for lasting tumor control, as well as emerging targeted medical therapies, all of which emphasize the need for an experienced multidisciplinary team.

2199,"Obesity: Assessment and prevention: Module 23.2 from Topic 23 ""Nutrition in obesity"". Obesity is one the major health problems of today showing an increasing prevalence among most countries. It is associated with increased risk of several diseases. The importance of early life strategies in the prevention of obesity is well established, whereas, in general, breastfed infants tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than formula-fed infants. There seem to be a series of behavioral and hormonal mechanisms that explain this difference. Lifestyle plays a crucial role in the development of overweight and/or obesity and targeted lifestyle modifications have an important impact on preventing obesity. In particular, sedentary behavior (viewing television, playing video games, doing cognitive work, and listening to music) and reduced overall physical activity along with shorter sleep duration promote the overconsumption of dietary macronutrients leading to obesity; at the same time physical activity or exercise in a sufficient dose seems to better facilitate long-term maintenance of new lower body weight. There is enough discussion about a potential effect of nutrients on obesity. Nevertheless, the most the crucial parameter regarding weight loss and prevention of obesity is to achieve a negative energy balance. In regard to specific diet regimes, again energy balance rather that any specific macronutrients composition and/or favoring of low glycemic index products, seems to be have a stronger effect on maintenance of lower weight after 12 months. It has to be noted, that for specific sup groups, obesity or overweight might be showing some favorable trends in survival. In particular, ""obesity paradox"" (OP) refers to an overall prognosis that is no worse and may even be better in some groups than non-obese patients. The OP could be explained by the fact that current classifications of obesity based on BMI may place together, in the same category, subjects with very different clinical and biochemical characteristics.

The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure. The dose-response and time-course data from the multiple animal groups tested in this study provide no evidence of magnetic-field-induced DNA damage.",Excluded
924,"Cranial irradiation and central hypothyroidism. Cranial irradiation causes thyrotropin (TSH)-releasing hormone (TRH) secretory abnormalities. TRH deficiency leads to abnormal glycosylation of TSH alpha and beta subunits and loss of the normal circadian pattern of TSH secretion (low in the afternoon, a surge in the evening, higher at night). This disruption results in either mixed hypothyroidism (raised TSH with abnormal secretory kinetics) or central hypothyroidism (abnormal secretory kinetics without raised TSH). Although primary hypothyroidism is more common in the general population and cancer survivors, the cumulative incidence of central and mixed hypothyroidism is high during the ten years after cranial irradiation. Monitoring for decline in free thyroxine (FT(4)) and rise in serum TSH, and early recognition using TSH surge and TRH tests, are clinically valuable. Early thyroid hormone replacement therapy to achieve serum FT(4) in the upper half of the normal range is crucial for maintaining optimal health and growth in cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the use of targeted or immunotherapy (TT/IT) in combination with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with melanoma brain metastasis (MBM). Therefore, we analyzed the outcome and toxicity of SRS alone compared to SRS in combination with TT/IT.METHODS: Patients with MBM treated with single session SRS at our department between 2014 and 2017 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months after first SRS were included. The primary endpoint of this study was local control (LC). Secondary endpoints were distant intracranial control, radiation necrosis-free survival (RNFS), and overall survival (OS). The local/ distant intracranial control rates, RNFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to test differences between groups. Cox proportional hazard model was performed for univariate continuous variables and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (17 male and 11 female) with 52 SRS-lesions were included. The median follow-up was 19 months (range 14-24 months) after first SRS. Thirty-six lesions (69.2%) were treated with TT/IT simultaneously (4 weeks before and 4 weeks after SRS), while 16 lesions (30.8%) were treated with SRS alone or with sequential TT/IT. The 1-year local control rate was 100 and 83.3% for SRS with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.023), respectively. The estimated 1-year RNFS was 90.0 and 82.1% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.935). The distant intracranial control rate after 1 year was 47.7 and 50% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.933). On univariate analysis, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment including the BRAF status (Melanoma-molGPA) was associated with a significantly improved LC. Neither gender nor SRS-PTV margin had a prognostic impact on LC. V10 and V12 were significantly associated with RNFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: SRS with simultaneous TT/IT significantly improved LC with no significant difference in radiation necrosis rate.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify secreted proteins in the retina of the adult zebrafish that are induced by the selective death of photoreceptors and to test experimentally the function of these proteins during the regeneration of photoreceptors.METHODS: Induced selective death of photoreceptors in the retina of the adult zebrafish was combined with in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to identify the induced cellular expression of the secreted beta-galactoside binding protein Galectin 1-like 2 (Drgal1-L2). Electroporation of morpholino oligonucleotides was used to knock down protein synthesis, and regenerated photoreceptors were counted in control and experimental retinas after labeling with cell type-specific RNA probes.RESULTS: Expression analysis and immunocytochemistry showed that Drgal1-L2 is induced de novo by photoreceptor death and is synthesized by microglia and proliferating Muller glia and their mitotic progeny. Knockdown of Drgal1-L2 expression in Muller glia results in reduced regeneration of rod photoreceptors without affecting injury-induced proliferation or the regeneration of cone photoreceptors.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, the authors conclude that Drgal1-L2 is induced by photoreceptor cell death and secreted by stem cells and neuronal progenitors and that it regulates the regeneration of rod photoreceptors. Drgal1-L2 is the first secreted factor shown to regulate aspects of regenerative neurogenesis in the teleost retina.",Excluded
1137,"Normal intima-media thickness on carotid ultrasound reliably excludes an ischemic cause of cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Patients with ischemia as the cause of LVSD may warrant revascularization. Angiography is the most accurate method of CAD diagnosis but is invasive, expensive, and associated with some risk. Noninvasive imaging for CAD often involves expensive equipment, radiation exposure, medication, and/or contrast administration. Carotid ultrasound with measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) is safe and inexpensive. Carotid IMT is well correlated with the presence of CAD. We assessed the accuracy of carotid ultrasound for identification of CAD as a potential etiology of LVSD.METHODS: Patients with LVSD (ejection fraction < or =40%) of uncertain etiology referred for angiography underwent carotid ultrasound. Patients with history of myocardial infarction were excluded. Two experienced cardiologists blinded to CAD status determined common carotid artery (CCA) IMT and plaque. Significant CAD was defined as > or =50% stenosis of any major artery. Ischemic LVSD was defined as (1) left main and/or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery > or =75% or (2) > or =2 major arteries with > or =75% stenosis.RESULTS: Mean ejection fraction was 27% +/- 10% in 150 patients. Significant CAD was found in 64 (42.7%) and ischemic LVSD in 40 (26.7%). Carotid plaque was seen in 95 (63.3%). Mean CCA IMT was > or =0.9 mm in 69 (46.0%). The combination of mean CCA IMT <0.9 mm and no plaque had negative predictive value for ischemic LVSD of 98%.CONCLUSIONS: Carotid ultrasound with IMT measurement is a valuable screening tool for excluding an ischemic etiology of LVSD when CAD is suspected.",Excluded

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in the course of Graves' disease. Nineteen patients with neuropathy out of 520 patients with Graves' disease, including 15 women and 4 men were treated. Age of the patients ranged from 36 to 69 years, mean age was 51.3. In all patients thyroid function was normalized, 4 patients underwent strumectomy. Bi- and unilateral neuropathy was found in 13 and 6 cases respectively. The therapy consisted of high-dose steroids (Prednisone in 12 cases or Dexamethasone i.v. in 3 cases) or they were combined with gamma cobalt-60 irradiation of orbit tissues (2000 c Gy in 10 fractions) in 8 cases. In 2 cases radiotherapy alone was performed. Two cases were excluded from treatment because of optic atrophy during the first examination. In all patients full ophthalmological investigation, ultrasonography and computed tomography of the orbit before and after the treatment were performed. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 46 months, mean 21.4. Improvement of visual acuity and perimetry (p < 0.05) after the treatment was observed and changes of the fundus after the treatment were significantly (p = 0.000) improved. Exophthalmos significantly decreased (p < 0.05) but only in the right eye. In all patients the therapy reduced the ophthalmopathy index from mean 7.5 to 4.1 (p = 0.000). In conclusion: 1. Early diagnosis and appropriate, constant conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease prevent from blindness and surgical intervention. 2.

1083,"[Assessment of the surgeon radiation exposure during a minimally invasive TLIF: Comparison between fluoroscopy and O-arm system]. INTRODUCTION: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with a minimally invasive approach (MIS TLIF) has become a very popular technique in the treatment of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine, as it allows a decrease in muscle iatrogenic. However, iterative radiological controls inherent to this technique are responsible for a significant increase in exposure to ionizing radiation for the surgeon. New techniques for radiological guidance (O-arm navigation-assisted) would overcome this drawback, but this remains unproven.OBJECTIVES: To analyze the exposure of the surgeon to intraoperative X-ray during a MIS TLIF under fluoroscopy and under O-arm navigation-assisted.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the University Hospital of Lille from February to May 2013. Twelve patients underwent a MIS TLIF for the treatment of low-grade spondylolisthesis; six under standard fluoroscopy (group 1) and six under O-arm system (group 2). Passive dosimeters (rings and glasses) and active dosimeters for thorax were used to measure the radiation exposure of the surgeon.RESULTS: For group 1, the average time of fluoroscopy was 3.718 minutes (3.13-4.56) while no radioscopy was perform on group 2. For the first group, the average exposure dose was 12 muSv (5-20 muSv) on the thorax, 1168 muSv (510-2790 muSv) on the main hand and 179 muSv (103-486 muSv) on the lens. The exposure dose was measured zero on the second group.CONCLUSION: The maximum recommended doses can be reached, mainly for the lens. In addition to the radioprotection measures, O-arm navigation systems are safe alternatives to significantly reduce surgeon exposure.",Excluded

3506,"Is autonomic modulation different between European and Chinese astronauts?. PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate autonomic control in groups of European and Chinese astronauts and to identify similarities and differences.METHODS: Beat-to-beat heart rate and finger blood pressure, brachial blood pressure, and respiratory frequency were measured from 10 astronauts (five European taking part in three different space missions and five Chinese astronauts taking part in two different space missions). Data recording was performed in the supine and standing positions at least 10 days before launch, and 1, 3, and 10 days after return. Cross-correlation analysis of heart rate and systolic pressure was used to assess cardiac baroreflex modulation. A fixed breathing protocol was performed to measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency power of systolic blood pressure variability.RESULTS: Although baseline cardiovascular parameters before spaceflight were similar in all astronauts in the supine position, a significant increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in vagal modulation occurred in the European astronauts when standing; spaceflight resulted in a remarkable vagal decrease in European astronauts only. Similar baseline supine and standing values for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory frequency were shown in both groups. Standing autonomic control was based on a balance of higher vagal and sympathetic modulation in European astronauts.CONCLUSION: Post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was observed in all European astronauts, whereas post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was significantly reduced in Chinese astronauts. The basis for orthostatic intolerance is not apparent; however, many possibilities can be considered and need to be further investigated, such as genetic diversities between races, astronaut selection, training, and nutrition, etc.",Excluded

The main objective of this study was to determine whether antioxidative potential of the tissues plays a role in the aging process. Antioxidative potential was ascertained as the susceptibility of tissues to undergo protein oxidation, manifested as protein carbonyls, in response to acute oxidative stress, induced by exposure to x-rays. Brain homogenates from 22-month-old rats were more susceptible to oxidative stress than those from three-month- old rats. Brain was more susceptible to oxidative damage than the heart.

181,"Optimization of stereotactic radiotherapy treatment delivery technique for base-of-skull meningiomas. This study compares static conformal field (CF), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and dynamic arcs (DA) for the stereotactic radiotherapy of base-of-skull meningiomas. Twenty-one cases of base-of-skull meningioma (median planning target volume [PTV] = 21.3 cm3) previously treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were replanned with each technique. The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the role of radiosurgery in the management of symptomatic patients with brainstem compression from benign basal tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Over a 17-year, period 246 patients (202 vestibular schwannomas and 44 meningiomas) with brainstem compression from benign skull-base tumors were managed with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Median tumor volumes were 3.9 cm(3) (range, 0.8-39.0 mL) and 6.6 mL (range, 1.6-25.1 mL) for vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas, respectively. For both tumors, a median marginal dose of 13 Gy was prescribed. Median follow-up of patients was 65 months for vestibular schwannomas and 60 months for meningiomas. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the tumor-brainstem relationship on neuroimaging.RESULTS: Preservation of function was stratified according to grade of brainstem compression. We analyzed the effect of radiosurgery on symptoms of brainstem compression. The tumor control rate was 100 % for meningioma and 97% for vestibular schwannomas (although 5% required an additional procedure such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt). In patients with vestibular schwannoma, serviceable hearing was preserved in 72.0%. Balance improved in 31.9%, remained unchanged in 56.5%, and deteriorated in 11.6% of patients who had imbalance at presentation. Balance improved significantly in patients who had less tumor compression (p = 0.0357) after radiosurgery. Symptoms improved in 43.2% of patients with meningioma.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a minimally invasive option for patients with benign basal tumors that indent or distort the brainstem. A high tumor growth control rate and satisfactory rate of neurological preservation and symptom control can be obtained with radiosurgery.",Excluded
3315,"Isolated Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the infundibulum presenting with fulminant diabetes insipidus. Introduction: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (histiocytosis X) is a rare disorder that can manifest with solitary bony lesions or disseminated disease in various tissues. A common manifestation of the disease is diabetes insipidus even in the absence of neural involvement. Disseminated disease often involves the central nervous system, but only six isolated lesions in the infundibulum have been reported. Case report: An 18-year-old male had failed to develop secondary sexual characteristics. He also had diabetes insipidus for more than 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 1-cm homogeneously enhancing mass in the region of the infundibulum. No other lesions were found in other organ systems. The patient underwent an orbitozygomatic osteotomy and pterional craniotomy. The lesion, which was adherent to the infundibulum, was partially resected. Microscopic analysis showed multiple lymphocytes and eosinophils with Langerhans cells that stained positive for S-100. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was diagnosed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 with no neurological deficits. His diabetes insipidus persisted, and he underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy to the sellar region. Conclusion(s): Isolated Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the infundibulum is rare. The usual presentation is hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and diabetes insipidus. Patients with diabetes insipidus of unknown origin should undergo MRI of the sellar region to rule out infundibular abnormalities. Â© Springer-Verlag 2006.",Excluded

Rabbit hypothalamic slices prelabelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline and superfused with Krebs solution were stimulated electrically at a frequency of 5 Hz. Exposure to verapamil (0.1 to 10 muM) significantly increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the electrically-evoked overflow of tritium, without affecting the spontaneous outflow of radioactivity. Exposure to diltiazem in concentrations up to 100 muM had no effect on the electrically evoked release of [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline, but increased the basal outflow of radioactivity at 10 and 100 muM. The preferential alpha<inf>2</inf>-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.1 muM) significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of clonidine or adrenaline on [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline overflow elicited by electrical stimulation. Verapamil (3 muM) also antagonized this inhibitory effect of the alpha<inf>2</inf>-adrenoceptor agonists on [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline release.

This article describes the diagnostic value of musculoskeletal sonography in the management of tendon pathology and outlines a clinical example of its scope of utilization. Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear. To summarize, the value of musculoskeletal sonography as a diagnostic tool as well as the assessment of the progression of tendon healing is discussed. Sonography is safe, noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is steadily gaining popularity in the diagnosis of tendon lesions.",Excluded

In previous work we have presented evidence for electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchange in Limulus ventral photoreceptors (1989. J. Gen. Physiol. 93:473-492). This article assesses the contributions to photoreceptor physiology from Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Four separate physiological processes were considered: maintenance of resting sensitivity, light-induced excitation, light adaptation, and dark adaptation. (a) Resting sensitivity: reduction of [Na+]o caused a [Ca2+]o-dependent reduction in light sensitivity and a speeding of the time courses of the responses to individual test flashes; this effect was dependent on the final value to which [Na+]o was reduced. The desensitization caused by Na+ reduction was dependent on the initial sensitivity of the photoreceptor; in fully dark-adapted conditions no desensitization was observed; in light-adapted conditions, extensive desensitization was observed. (b) Excitation: Na+ reduction in fully dark-adapted conditions caused a Ca2+o-dependent depolarizing phase in the receptor potential that persisted beyond the stimulus duration and was evoked by a bright adapting flash. (c) Light adaptation: the degree of desensitization induced by a bright adapting flash was Na+o dependent, being larger with lower [Na+]o. Na+ reduction enhanced light adaptation only at intensities brighter than 4 x 10(-6) W/cm2. In addition to being Na+o dependent, light adaptation was Ca2+o dependent, being greater at higher [Ca2+]o. (d) Dark adaptation: the recovery of light sensitivity after adapting illumination was Na+o dependent. Dark adaptation after bright illumination in voltage-clamped and in unclamped conditions was faster in normal-Na+ saline than in reduced Na+ saline. The final sensitivity to which photoreceptors recovered was lower in reduced-Na+ saline when bright adapting illumination was used. The results suggest the involvement of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in each of these physiological processes. Na+/Ca2+ exchange may contribute to these processes by counteracting normal elevations in [Ca2+]i.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 21 patients who were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, using either VMAT, DCAT or 3DCRT, were included in this study. The volume categorisation was seven patients each in <1, 1-2 and 2-3 cc volume. The treatment was planned with 6 MV FF and FFF beams using three different techniques: VMAT/Rapid Arc (RA) (RA_FF and RA_FFF), dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCA_FF and DCA_FFF) and 3DCRT (Static_FF and Static_FFF). Plans were evaluated for target coverage (V100%), conformity index, homogeneity index, dose gradient for 50% dose fall-off, total MU and MU/dose ratio [intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) factor], normal brain receiving >12 Gy dose, dose to the organ at risk (OAR), beam ON time and dose received by 12 cc of the brain. Result(s): The average target coverage for all plans, all tumour volumes (TVs) and delivery techniques is 96.4 +/- 4.5 (range 95.7 +/- 6.1-97.5 +/- 2.9%). The conformity index averaged over all volume ranges <1, 2, 3 cc> varies between 0.55 +/- 0.08 and 0.68 +/- 0.04 with minimum and maximum being exhibited by DCA_FFF for 1 cc and Static_FFF/RA_FFF for 3 cc tumours, respectively. Mean IMRT factor averaged over all volume ranges for RA_FF, DCA_FF and Static_FF are 3.5 +/- 0.8, 2.0 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively; 50% dose fall-off gradient varies in the range of 0.33-0.42, 0.35-0.40 and 0.38-0.45 for 1, 2 and 3 cc tumours, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study establishes the equivalence between the FF and FFF beam models and different delivery techniques for stereotactic radiosurgery in small TVs in the range of <=1 to <=3 cc. Dose conformity, heterogeneity, dose fall-off characteristics and OAR doses show no or very little variation. FFF could offer only limited time advantage due to excess dose rate over an FF beam.

2798,"The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of small cell lung cancer. Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are candidates for aggressive therapy because of their potential for long-term survival, especially patients with limited-stage disease. Although no treatment protocol can be considered 'standard', the best results in limited-stage SCLC appear to be produced by a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation. Ongoing protocols testing the efficacy of thoracic irradiation should be able to settle question of the optimal treatment approach in limited-stage SCLC over the next 1 to 2 years. Careful attention to volume treated and the use of shrinking fields produce the best results with the minimum of toxicity. Treatment of extensive-stage SCLC has not been substantially improved to date with the addition of local systemic irradiation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of CNS failure in SCLC and should be given, at a minimum, to patients achieving complete response status. Whether patients with partial response should also receive prophylactic cranial irradiation remains controversial. Finally, half-body radiation in SCLC is an experimental research technique that has shown some promise but remains quite toxic when combined with systemic chemotherapy.",Excluded

Purpose: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has a well-recognized role in the treatment of leukemia and small-cell lung cancer. Clinical utility has yet to be determined for breast cancer, where an emerging group at high risk of brain metastasis has fuelled consideration of PCI. Methods and Materials: In reviewing our experience with PCI as part of a complex protocol for advanced breast cancer, we present descriptive data on late central nervous system outcomes in those receiving PCI. After high-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, Stage IIIB/IV breast cancer responders underwent tandem autologous marrow transplantation. Those in continued remission were referred for PCI. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered by usual means, at 36 Gy in 20 fractions. Result(s): Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia. Conclusion(s): We present a series of advanced breast cancer patients treated prophylactically with whole-brain radiotherapy following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. Although the therapeutic benefit of PCI is not ascertainable here, we describe brain metastases occurring despite PCI and serious long-term neurobehavioral sequelae in PCI-treated patients.

Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, potential toxicity, and cosmetic outcome of fractionated interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost for the management of patients with breast cancer at increased risk for local recurrence.Methods and Materials: From 1994 to 1996, 18 women with early stage breast cancer underwent conventionally fractionated whole breast radiotherapy (50-50.4 Gy) followed by interstitial HDR brachytherapy boost. All were considered to be at high risk for local failure. Seventeen had pathologically confirmed final surgical margins of less than 2 mm or focally positive. Brachytherapy catheter placement and treatment delivery were conducted on an outpatient basis. Preplanning was used to determine optimal catheter positions to enhance dose homogeneity of dose delivery. The total HDR boost dose was 15 Gy delivered in 6 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 days. Local control, survival, late toxicities (LENT-SOMA), and cosmetic outcome were recorded in follow-up. In addition, factors potentially influencing cosmesis were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The minimum follow-up is 40 months with a median 50 months. Sixteen patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. There have been no in-breast failures observed. One patient died with brain metastases, and another died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease. Grade 1-2 late toxicities included 39% with hyperpigmentation, 56% with detectable fibrosis, 28% with occasional discomfort, and 11% with visible telangiectasias. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in one patient as persistent discomfort. Sixty-seven percent of patients were considered to have experienced good/excellent cosmetic outcomes. Factors with a direct relationship to adverse cosmetic outcome were extent of surgical defect (p = 0.00001), primary excision volume (p = 0.017), and total excision volume (p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): For high risk patients who may benefit from increased doses, interstitial HDR brachytherapy provides a convenient outpatient method for boosting the lumpectomy cavity following conventional whole breast irradiation without overdosing normal tissues. The fractionation scheme of 15 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is well tolerated. The volume of tissue removed from the breast at lumpectomy appears to dominate cosmetic outcome in this group of patients. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Several large cohort studies of 80-198 patients have reported complication rates of 2.5% to 9% using particles or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA).[1-5] However, although a recent national registry of 898 patients found an association between liquid embolysate and complication rates, with an odds ratio of 3.9.[6] Endovascular technology continues to evolve and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH or Onyx Medtronic) has been available for embolization of arteriovenous malformations for over a decade. The off-label use of EVOH for pre-operative embolization of meningiomas or hemangiopericytomas has only been reported in small series. This study reviewed the safety profile and embolization duration of our experience with EVOH embolization. Methods Review of institutional records identified 72 consecutive cases of meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas that underwent pre-operative embolization with EVOH prior to surgical resection from 2007 to 2017. The imaging and medical records were reviewed to identify tumor dimensions, vascular pedicles, endovascular equipment, outcomes and complications.

Results The tumors measured 5 cm (IQR 4.4-6.3) or 45 cm<sup>3</sup> (23-71) and were located on the convexity (26%), tentorium (22%), falx (20%), sphenoid ridge (15%), petrous (5%), anterior cranial fossa (5%), infratemporal fossa (4%), and middle cranial fossa (3%). The most frequent pedicle embolized was a middle meningeal artery. In 83% of cases, this was the first pedicle embolized and in 24% of cases, an additional MMA catheterization was used for embolization. Additional pedicles included the internal maxillary (8), occipital artery (7), superficial temporal (4), posterior meningeal (2), posterior auricular (1), and ascending pharyngeal (1) arteries. Tumor supply from branches of the internal carotid artery were typically not embolized: anterior cerebral branches (3 embolized: 7 not embolized), middle cerebral branches (0:11), ophthalmic branches (0:11). In 7 cases, nBCA was also used, most commonly in the superior cerebellar artery (3:7). Abstract O-033 Table 1 Tumor embolization characteristics VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP There were symptomatic complications from embolization in 8% of cases. Twice, tumor necrosis and edema required earlier craniotomy and tumor evacuation, and four patients had new neurologic deficit from infarct. Two occurred from reflux and two occurred from embolysate migration across the tumor to pial vessels. The complication rate was not different from studies in meningiomas with 75 or more cases using other embolysates (p-value 0.15-1.0). In power analysis, comparison against previously published studies would distinguish a complication rate of 23% in a series of this size. Conclusion Embolization with EVOH is comparable in safety to other embolization techniques in meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Similar to what has been described in arteriovenous malformations, simultaneous dual catheter embolization may decrease procedural time and radiation exposure.",Excluded
121,"A phase II study of a temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy regimen for high-risk low-grade gliomas: Preliminary results of RTOG 0424. Background: The primary endpoint of RTOG 0424 was to compare the 3-year survival (OS) of a regimen of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy (RT) in a high-risk low-grade glioma (LGG) population to the 3 year (yr) OS rate of the high risk EORTC LGG patients (pts) reported by Pignatti et al (J Clin Oncol 2002;20(8):2076-84).Secondary endpoints were: progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, neurocognitive and quality of life data and molecular analysis. Method(s): Pts with LGG's and >=3 high risk factors (age> = 40, astrocytoma dominant histology, tumor crossing midline, tumor > = 6 cm or preoperative neurological function status >1) were eligible and treated with conformal RT (54 Gy/30 fractions) plus concurrent TMZ 75 mgm<sup>2</sup> /day for 6 weeks and post-RT TMZ 150-200 mgm<sup>2</sup>/day days 1-5 q28 days for up to 12 cycles. The study was designed to detect a 43% increase in median survival time (MST) from 40.5 to 57.9 months, and a 20% improvement in 3 yr OS rate from 54% to 65%, at a 10% significance level (1 sided) and 96% power. Result(s): Between January 2005-August 2009 136 pts were accrued, 129 (75 males, 54 females) were evaluable. Median age was 49 years, 91% had a Zubrod score 0-1 and 69%, 25% and 6% of pts had 3,4 and 5 high risk factors respectively. With a median follow-up time of 4.1 yrs, minimum follow-up of 3 yrs, MST has not yet been reached. Three year OS rate was 73.1% (95%CI:65.3-80.8%), significantly improved from historical control with a p-value <0.0001. No difference in OS rates for pts with 3, 4 or 5 high risk factors was seen. 3 year PFS was 59.2% (95% CI:50.7-67.8%).

3341,"Menstrual restoration in severe panhypopituitarism many years after cranial irradiation for suprasellar germinoma. Purpose: We report a very rare case showing menstrual restoration in severe pan-hypopituitarism many years after cranial irradiation for suprasellar germinoma.Case: A 30-year-old, almost primarily amenorrheic woman with severe panhypopituitarism presented with cyclic genital bleeding for the previous five months. She had menstruated once, when she was 13 years old. When she was 14 years old, she was diagnosed with a suprasellar germinoma measuring 10 mm in diameter, which led to diabetes insipidus. Cranial irradiation with a total dose of 24 Gy and chemotherapy resulted in complete tumor remission. She developed severe hypopituitarism [luteinizing hormone (LH) = 0.4 mIU/mL, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) = 1.7 mIU/mL, and serum estradiol (E2) level < 10 pg/mL]. She had received multiple hormone replacement therapies for many years. When she was 29 years old, she expressed a desire to become pregnant. Serum gonadotropin and E2 levels increased (LH = 5.8 mIU/mL, FSH = 5.9 mIU/mL, and E2 = 58 pg/mL). She conceived with clomiphene therapy, and then delivered a healthy baby. Eight months after parturition, her basal body temperature and serum progesterone levels indicated recovery of ovulatory cycles. Ten months after parturition, she also spontaneously conceived.Conclusion: Menstrual restoration is very rare in severe panhypopituitarism after cranial irradiation. A relatively low dose of irradiation and small tumor size may have contributed to the recovery of menstruation in our patient.",Excluded
2435,"Circular collimator arc versus dynamic conformal arc treatment planning for linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery of an intracranial small single lesion: a perspective of lesion asymmetry. BACKGROUND: Although circular collimator arcs (CCA) and dynamic conformal arcs (DCA) are commonly used linear accelerator-based treatment planning techniques for intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of a small single lesion, these two techniques have not been rigorously compared in terms of tumor shape. Therefore, this study compared clinical CCA plans with re-planned DCA plans using conformity index (CI) and V12Gy (volume of normal brain tissue receiving 12 Gy or higher) from a perspective of asymmetry (Asym) of planning target volume (PTV).METHODS: Ninety-five clinical CCA plans delivered for a small single lesion with PTV size < 1.4 cm<sup>3</sup> were selected and re-planned using DCA. PTV Asym (%) was defined and calculated from three dimensions of PTV. A pair of the 95 plans was first considered as one group without grouping and then categorized into two groups with respective to either PTV size or PTV Asym, and four groups with respect to PTV size and PTV Asym. For grouping, median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were used. A non-parametric paired test was performed for CI and V12Gy to compare CCA and DCA plans in each group.RESULTS: Median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were 0.415 cm<sup>3</sup> (range: 0.076 cm<sup>3</sup>-1.369 cm<sup>3</sup>) and 6.12% (range: 0.52-25.74%), respectively. DCA plans had a lower average CI value than CCA plans for all groups. CCA plans had a smaller average V12Gy value than DCA plans for lesions with PTV Asym <=6.12%, while CCA and DCA plans had similar average V12Gy values for lesions with PTV Asym > 6.12%.CONCLUSIONS: The DCA technique is recommended when a lesion has PTV Asym > 6.12% regardless of PTV size. For lesions with PTV Asym <=6.12%, a technique choice would depend on the preference of CI or V12Gy.",Excluded
320,"Lack of promoting effects of chronic exposure to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 cellular system on development of N-ethylnitrosourea-induced central nervous system tumors in F344 rats. The present study was performed to evaluate effects of a 2-year exposure to an electromagnetic near-field (EMF) equivalent to that generated by cellular phones on tumor development in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats. For this purpose, pregnant F344 rats were given a single administration of N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on gestational day 18. A total of 500 pups were divided into five groups, each composed of 50 males and 50 females: Group 1, untreated controls; Group 2, ENU alone; Groups 3 to 5, ENU + EMF (sham exposure and two exposure levels). A 1.95-GHz wide-band code division multiple access (W-CDMA) signal, which is a feature of the International Mobile Telecommunication 2000 (IMT-2000) cellular system was employed for exposure of the rat head starting from 5 weeks of age, 90 min a day, 5 days a week, for 104 weeks. Brain average specific absorption rates (SARs) were designed to be .67 and 2.0 W/kg for low and high exposures, respectively. The incidence and numbers of brain tumors in female rats exposed to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals showed tendencies to increase but without statistical significance. Overall, no significant increase in incidences or numbers, either in the males or females, was detected in the EMF-exposed groups. In addition, no clear changes in tumor types in the brain were evident. Thus, under the present experimental conditions, exposure of heads of rats to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 for a 2-year period was not demonstrated to accelerate or otherwise affect ENU-initiated brain tumorigenesis.",Excluded
1729,"Exploring the cost-effectiveness of thoracic radiation therapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): The recently reported Chest Radiotherapy Extensive Stage Trial (CREST) showed that administering thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) after a response to first-line chemotherapy improves 2-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival, without an increase in adverse events, in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding TRT to chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ESSCLC patients. Materials/Methods: Using a partitioned survival model, a cost-utility analysis was performed to compare strategies of TRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions via 3-D conformal RT) plus PCI versus PCI alone. The time horizon was limited to 24 months, the median follow-up of CREST. OS was partitioned into three mutually exclusive health states: alive with no progression (ANP), alive with progression (AWP), and dead. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was based on the empirical survival functions reported in CREST. Institutional treatment costs from a payer perspective were used while utilities were derived from the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed plausible ranges of uncertainty in key variables including costs, utilities, and the TRT survival benefit. Result(s): In the base-case analysis, adding TRT resulted in a $4,066 cost increase and a gain of 0.06 QALYs (0.09 LYs), yielding an ICER of $66,901/QALY ($46,568/LY). Extending the time horizon to 30 months, assuming: (1), a persistent survival benefit and (2), a declining benefit to a hazard ratio of 1, resulted in ICERs of $93,204 and $111,916/QALY respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ICER to be most sensitive to variations in ANP and AWP health state costs. The ICER was moderately sensitive to variations in TRT costs and the utility for the ANP state, but less sensitive to changes in the utility for the AWP state. Conclusion(s): Adding TRT to chemotherapy in ES-SCLC patients was found to be cost effective using commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, with an ICER lower than those of many systemic treatments for metastatic disease. Since the incremental survival benefit of TRT beyond 24 months is small, its cost-effectiveness is expected to decrease if costs remain constant.",Excluded
2770,"Dexamethasone-related adrenal insufficiency in patients with brain and skull base tumours. Purpose or Objective This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in a cohort of patients with brain and skull base tumours and to identify factors which may predict its occurrence. Material and Methods Patients with brain or skull base tumours attending for a short synacthen test (SST) at a single institution between October 2010 and January 2014 were retrospectively identified. Baseline demographics and dexamethasone exposure was scrutinised. Fisher's Exact, Student's ttest, Mann-Whitney and the Kendall's tau-b were used to evaluate differences between patients who passed or failed the SST. Results Thirty-one of 51 patients with previous dexamethasone exposure failed their first SST (61%). Duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone was significantly different between pass and fail groups (p=0.001 and p=0.007 respectively). No significant relationship was demonstrated between age, gender, diagnosis or mean pituitary radiation dose and SST results. Receiver operator characteristic curves generated suggest both duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone are acceptable discriminators when predicting SST failure. These curves generate values of 78 days and 171 milligram days respectively with optimum sensitivity (i.e. ability to detect SST failures.) Conclusion These values may be used clinically to identify patients at higher risk of adrenal suppression who require empirical hydrocortisone pending formal testing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",Excluded

A nonfluoroscopic temporomandibular joint arthrographic technique is contrasted with a more widely employed fluoroscopically guided technique. The nonfluoroscopic technique uses a posterior approach to joint injection, as contrasted with the lateral injection approach of the fluoroscopically guided technique. The advantages of the nonfluoroscopic technique are less radiation dose to the patient, less expensive and less sophisticated imaging equipment, and less potential for neurovascular trauma. The fluoroscopic technique offers greater control of the procedure, less patient and operator time, and the capability for a dynamic videofluoroscopic study. Both techniques appear to be safe and efficacious. Differences in anatomy, imaging modalities, patient radiation exposure, and potential complications are also discussed as part of this comparison.

3032,"Different levodopa actions on the extracellular dopamine pools in the rat striatum. Levodopa has been the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease for several decades, but the precise mechanism for its therapeutic action is still not well understood. To date, little distinction has been made between the effects of levodopa on the different brain DA pools. We studied the levodopa action on two extracellular DA pools: one was analyzed by microdialysis (often considered as indicative of volume transmission) and the other by in vivo amperometry during nigrostriatal cell stimulation (more indicative of neurotransmission). Levodopa administration induced a moderate (increased 200%) and tardy (began at 60 min) increase in the DA-pool measured by microdialysis, an effect that increased (increased 500%) and accelerated (began at 10 min) after DA-cell degeneration. Levodopa action on the DA-pool measured by amperometry was very fast (10 min) and prominent (increased 600%) in normal rats. The DA-denervated striatum showed a fast exhaustion during cell stimulation, which prevented further study of the levodopa effect on the DA amperometry-pool under this condition. This study suggests a different kinetic for levodopa action on the volume transmitter and neurotransmitter DA-pool, showing marked changes in levodopa action in the denervated striatum.",Excluded

To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded
3402,"Risk factors for early death after surgery in patients with brain metastases: reevaluation of the indications for and role of surgery. Surgical resection remains an important option for the treatment of brain metastases despite recent advancements in radiotherapy and systemic therapy. When selecting surgical candidates, it is important to exclude terminal cases who will receive neither a survival benefit nor an improvement in their quality of life. We reviewed a total of 264 surgical cases of brain metastases and analyzed the clinical characteristics of early death in order to clarify the indication for and the role of surgery. The median survival time (MST) after surgery in all cases was 12.4 months. Early death was defined as death within 6 months, and 23% (62 cases) of this series were succumbed to this. A decrease in postoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (<70) (P = 0.041), lack of systemic therapy after surgery (P < 0.0001), and uncontrolled extracranial malignancies (P = 0.0022) were significantly related to early death in multivariate analysis, while preoperative KPS (<70) and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class were related to early death only in univariate analysis (P < 0.05). When analyzing patients with uncontrolled extracranial malignancies and those with a postoperative KPS score of 70 or greater (who were generally candidates for systemic therapy), the MST was significantly longer in the systemic therapy (+) group compared with the systemic therapy (-) group (12.5 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.0026).

Background and Purpose - Patients with carotid occlusive disease and stage 2 cerebral hemodynamic failure, characterized by an increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and otherwise known as misery perfusion, have a high risk of cerebral ischemia and subsequent stroke. In clinical practice, the detection of patients with misery perfusion through the use of widely available, noninvasive, and cost-effective modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is extremely important. Methods - We evaluated the relationships between the regional hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation, measured with split-dose [<sup>123</sup>I] N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine SPECT (<sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT) and an acetazolamide challenge, and hemodynamic parameters, including OEF measured with PET, in 27 patients with both unilateral and bilateral carotid occlusive diseases. Results - A significant negative correlation was found between the SPECT-measured cerebrovascular reserve after acetazolamide administration and both the PET-measured OEF and cerebral blood volume. Neither the cerebrovascular reserve nor the cerebral blood flow index, when expressed as a SPECT-measured cerebrum-to-cerebellum ratio, was useful for detecting lesions with an elevated OEF. However, a combination of the cerebrovascular reserve and cerebral blood flow index showed high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the detection of misery perfusion.

Recent studies have suggested that regeneration of non-haematopoietic cell lineages can occur through heterotypic cell fusion with haematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. Here we show that lymphocytes also form heterotypic-fusion hybrids with cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, hepatocytes and Purkinje neurons. However, through lineage fate-mapping we demonstrate that such in vivo fusion of lymphoid and myeloid blood cells does not occur to an appreciable extent in steady-state adult tissues or during normal development. Rather, fusion of blood cells with different non-haematopoietic cell types is induced by organ-specific injuries or whole-body irradiation, which has been used in previous studies to condition recipients of bone marrow transplants.

The present investigation evaluates the dental care situation of patients with head and neck cancer before and after radiotherapy. The situations of these patients in 1993 and 2005 were compared to detect similarities, differences and developments. In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005. Therefore the applied radiotherapeutic regimen differed not only between the two groups of patients, but also within each group. The information for these investigations was provided anonymously. It was evaluated with descriptive statistics. The evaluation of the data shows distinct differences with respect to preventive and therapeutic dental care measures. In 2005, 35 out of 36 patients (97.2%) had a dental consultation before radiotherapy (1993, 65%). All 27 dentate patients (100%) obtained a splint for fluoride application (1993, none). 29% fewer edentulous patients were seen than in 1993. The number of teeth destroyed decreased from 19.2% (1993) to 7.8% in 2005. Mycoses due to Candida spp. and chronic failures in wound healing were rare (5.5%). In the course of the 12 years, prophylactic measures, such as the application of splints for fluoride treatment, were intensified. However, concepts for the dental care of patients undergoing radiotherapy, especially following the radiation, should be widened to avoid ruined teeth and long delayed wound healings.",Excluded
95,"Neuroimaging in Pregnant Women. Choosing the most appropriate diagnostic neuroimaging study for a pregnant woman involves assessing the pretest likelihood of serious treatable neurologic disease, the diagnostic utility of various available computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) modalities, and the risks of each. Of these three elements-pretest differential diagnosis, utility of MRI and CT, and risks of MR and CT-the risk component is perhaps the least well understood by most physicians. We provide a basic review of the intrinsic risks of MRI and CT, particularly radiation biology and radiation safety, as well as the risks pertaining to the use of contrast agents, to reduce provider confusion and anxiety and improve quality, safety, and efficiency of neuroimaging diagnosis in pregnant patients. We believe that a better understanding of the associated very low risks with mother and fetus will reassure the reader that CT remains the most appropriate tool for initial rapid diagnosis of acute neurological conditions in pregnancy and that in urgent situations CT should not be withheld or delayed due to exaggerated concern about radiation. Noncontrast MRI, while not without risk, is generally considered safe in pregnancy, as no evidence of fetal adverse effects has been demonstrated to date. Iodinated CT contrast agents are likely safer than gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents because of gadolinium accumulation in the amniotic fluid and fetal tissue, although no harmful effects of tissue gadolinium accumulation are known. In most but not all pregnant patients presenting with a new or worsening neurological abnormality, the risks intrinsic to the disease will outweigh the risks of imaging. In an individual patient, the pretest probability of serious treatable disease and acuity of presentation will usually suggest an optimal imaging strategy and choice of test. This optimal strategy will also depend on the immediate availability and level of sophistication of the scanners, software, technologists, and radiologists. As such, the standard of care for imaging in pregnancy requires direct consultation between the referring clinician and radiologist to determine the most appropriate strategy and brief documentation of the resulting consensus risk-benefit assessment.

3579,"Cerenkov luminescence imaging with PET probes for brain function analysis. Objectives Optical imaging has advantages in its easy-to-use feature. However, brain imaging is not easy in optical molecular imaging, since the molecular sizes of fluorescent probes are usually too large to penetrate the bloodbrain- barrier. On the other hands, PET imaging is superior in quantitative analysis, and many brain imaging probes are available. Cerenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as a positron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of CLI for the analysis of brain functions using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Methods For [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging, the mice were separated into two groups. For one group, the hair of the mice were shaved (w/o hair), and for other group, the skull was additionally removed (w/o hair & skull). [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (3 MBq, iv) was injected to each group of the mice, and PET imaging was performed from 30 to 60 min after the injection. Then, Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) was done for 10 min from just after the PET imaging. After in vivo CLI, the brain was removed and ex vivo CLI was performed. Then, the radioactivity of the brain was measured by a gamma-counter. Various fasting times were set for each mouse in order to produce various blood sugar levels. For [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride imaging, the mice (w/o hair) were injected with 7.4 MBq of the tracer, and sequential 8-min CLI (followed by 2-min interval) was performed from 8-10 min after the injection. In vivo blocking study was done by treating the mice with haloperidol. Also, the images were obtained by [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Results In [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG studies, there was a good relationship between the radioactivity and CLI signal in removed brains (r=0.93). The good correlation was observed in w/o hair & skull group (r=0.92). The correlation was weaker in w/o hair group (r=0.74), but it thought to be acceptable for the analysis in mice. The striatum was successfully visualized by [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Luminescence in the striatum was decreased by haloperidol treatment. Since the brain uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT was higher than [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT produced more clearer images in CLI.

Although both quantitativity and sensitivity are inferior to PET imaging, it is possible to use CRI for brain function analysis in mice.",Excluded
2519,"Functional imaging of the brain in the evaluation of drug response and its application to the study of aging. Functional neuroimaging techniques including single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) can provide insight into the functional connectivity of the human brain in both health and disease, including the effects of aging and drugs on brain function. Neuroimaging measurement techniques can either be direct, using radiospecific ligands, or indirect, using the neurophysiological consequences of pharmacological interventions. Both approaches can be combined with sensorimotor or cognitive activation to examine the interaction between the targeted receptor function and the sensorimotor or cognitive process implicit in the study design. Using radionuclides, PET can provide absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow to regions of interest and can measure changes in cerebral metabolism using labelled fluorodeoxyglucose. PET offered the first opportunity to image brain activation caused by a variety of stimuli and hence to measure the effect of drugs on brain activation. PET also enables the study of drug disposition within the brain. SPECT has been used to study relative changes in cerebral blood flow associated with disease processes and also receptor occupancy. FMRI, by contrast, does not involve ionising radiation and has better spatial and temporal resolution. It is still a relatively new technique and limited by its ability to only measure haemodynamic changes through the blood oxygen lever dependent (BOLD) signal. The effects of aging on drug responsiveness and the effects of drug treatment of diseases associated with old age are relatively unexplored areas of functional neuroimaging research.",Excluded
1828,"Clinical controversies: proton radiation therapy for brain and skull base tumors. Proton radiotherapy offers distinct physical properties that could lead to an improvement of dose distribution with subsequent reduction of integral dose to the patient. This supports the potential use of proton beams in tumors close to sensitive structures, such as the skull base and the brain. In the present manuscript, the literature on proton therapy for brain and skull base tumors is critically reviewed and compared with results obtained with modern photon techniques. Treatment planning comparisons demonstrate that dose distributions within the target are comparable. In terms of normal tissue dose distribution, protons offer an advantage in the intermediate- and low-dose regions, and this may result in long-term clinical benefit, although to date no randomized or long-term follow-up data demonstrate this. Considering the excellent long-term results seen with photons in localized tumors, this benefit may be modest and difficult to demonstrate. Protons may allow for safe delivery of higher local doses with the potential to improve local control in some tumors. However, improvements in photon techniques also enable safe dose escalation, and therefore, the comparison of the techniques of delivery is likely to need randomized trials. Proton therapy offers effective treatment for a range of brain tumors. However, the limited availability, the cost, and the lack of evidence of superiority mean that advanced photon radiotherapy continues to be the treatment of choice. It is hoped that advances in technology, both in proton and photon radiotherapy delivery, and increasing information on the efficacy and toxicity of the two modalities will lead to further improvement in radiotherapy approaches and provide the basis for the best choice of treatment for the individual patient.",Excluded
373,"Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy in the management of primary oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma. PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze the outcomes and benefits from radiation therapy (RT) as a component of multimodal treatment for oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma, assessing local control and survival rates and evaluating prognostic factors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 56 adult patients with supratentorial oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma treated at our institution from January 1990 to December 2003 with fractionated stereotactic RT (FSRT).RESULTS: Fractionated stereotactic RT was well tolerated in all patients, without side effects. Median survival and progression-free survival calculated from the initiation of radiotherapy were 48 months (range, 2-133 months) and 38 months (range, 2-132 months), respectively. Progression-free survival rates after radiation were 89% at 1 year and 52% at 5 years. Of 26 recurrences, 92% developed in field. With regard to histology, overall survival rates in the World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II group were 89% and 74% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In patients with WHO Grade III tumors, overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 69% and 46%, respectively. No prognosticators could be identified for median survival and progression-free survival after radiotherapy. Median overall survival calculated from primary diagnosis was 77.5 months (range, 3-214 months). The Cox regression multivariate analysis for age and neurologic symptoms showed a significance of p = 0.003 for age and p = 0.037 for the presence of neurologic symptoms on overall survival since primary diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Commonly, conventional conformal RT is applied in the treatment of brain tumors. In FSRT, the tumor volume can be irradiated with high doses, sparing volume of normal brain tissue. Our data are in accordance with survival times found in the literature. Ninety-two percent of all recurrences occurred within the defined target volume, confirming that reduction of the RT portals by the use of FSRT does not lead to an increased rate of recurrences at the field border or out of field. Fractionated stereotactic RT can therefore be implemented as an effective and safe modality in the therapy of primary oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma.",Excluded
58,"Thoracic and elective brain irradiation with concomitant or delayed multiagent chemotherapy in the treatment of localized small cell carcinoma of the lung: a randomized prospective study by the Southeastern Cancer Study Group. A prospective randomized study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of concomitant or delayed multiagent chemotherapy combined with irradiation to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes and to the brain in a group of 70 patients with histologically proven small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. Complete and partial response in both groups was comparable, and the overall survival was comparable. However, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and irradiation in comparison with the radiotherapy alone group. Disease-free survival was higher in the concomitant chemotherapy-radiotherapy patients, although survival was not significantly modified, probably because of suboptimal chemotherapy. The initial intrathoracic failure rate was 40.7% inthe concomitant chemotherapy-irradiation group, compared with 53.8% in the radiotherapy-alone patients. None of the patients receiving delayed chemotherapy following the radiotherapy recurrence showed significant tumor response to the drugs. The incidence of distant metastasis was slightly lower in the chemotherapy groups. Brain metastases were noted in 7% of the patients in both groups. Increased intrathoracic recurrences were noted in patients with lower doses of irradiation. Nine of 13 patients treated with inadequate portals developed intrathoracic recurrences in comparison to 13 of 40 treated with adequate irradiation fields. The study emphasizes the need for intensive chemotherapy and adequate radiation therapy to improve survival of patients with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. Additional trials are necessary to assess the role of each modality in the management of these patients.",Excluded
623,"Illumination controls differentiation of dopamine neurons regulating behaviour. Specification of the appropriate neurotransmitter is a crucial step in neuronal differentiation because it enables signalling among populations of neurons. Experimental manipulations demonstrate that both autonomous and activity-dependent genetic programs contribute to this process during development, but whether natural environmental stimuli specify transmitter expression in a neuronal population is unknown. We investigated neurons of the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus that regulate neuroendocrine pituitary function in response to light in teleosts, amphibia and primates. Here we show that altering light exposure, which changes the sensory input to the circuit controlling adaptation of skin pigmentation to background, changes the number of neurons expressing dopamine in larvae of the amphibian Xenopus laevis in a circuit-specific and activity-dependent manner. Neurons newly expressing dopamine then regulate changes in camouflage colouration in response to illumination. Thus, physiological activity alters the numbers of behaviourally relevant amine-transmitter-expressing neurons in the brain at postembryonic stages of development. The results may be pertinent to changes in cognitive states that are regulated by biogenic amines.",Excluded
1377,"[Analysis of prognostic factors in NSCLC patients with brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enhanced MRI after whole brain radiotherapy]. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Brain metastases are a common complication of lung cancer, occurring in 20%-40% of patients. The aim of this study is to explore prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enhanced MRI after whole brain radiotherapy.METHODS: TA retrospective review of clinical data from 241 NSCLC patients with brain metastases received whole brain radiotherapy from April 2007 to October 2008 was performed. A number of potential factors that might affect prognosis after irradiation were evaluated. The significance of prognostic variables in the survival resulted from univariate analysis by Kaplan-Meier combining with Log-rank test, and the multivariate analysis was obtained by Cox regression model.RESULTS: Median follow-up time for the survivors was 19.1 months. For all patients, the median survival time (MST) was 8.7 months. By univariate analysis, female patients with KPS>70, no symptom when diagnosed with brain metastases, tumor controlled in the chest, and received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and combined target therapy were the important factors for overall survival. By multivariate analysis, female, tumors controlled in the chest, and combined target therapy were independent prognostic factors for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Tumor controlled in the chest was the most important independent prognostic factor.CONCLUSIONS: Gender, local tumor controlled, and combined target therapy significantly influenced NSCLC brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enchanced MRI survival after whole brain radiotherapy.eciated patient subsets and is a useful method for dissecting complex clinical situations.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for complex-shaped benign meningiomas of the skull base and report clinical experience.METHODS: Twenty patients with benign skull-base meningiomas WHO degrees I (histopathologically proven in 16/20) were treated with IMRT between June 1998 and August 1999. Each tumor was complex in shape and adherent to, or encompassed, organs at risk (cranial nerves, optic apparatus, and brainstem). All patients, immobilized in a customized head mask integrated into a stereotactic system, were planned on an inverse treatment planning system using 5 or 7 coplanar, equidistant beams and 5 intensity steps. Each treatment plan was verified extensively before treatment. Follow-up with MRI and clinical examination was performed at 6 and 18 weeks and every 6 months thereafter.RESULTS: Target volumes ranged from 27 to 278 cc (median: 108 cc). Mean dose in 32 fractions ranged between 55.8 and 58.2 Gy. At median follow-up of 36 months (range: 31-43 months), pre-existing neurologic symptoms improved in 12/20 (60%), remained stable in 7/20 (35%), and worsened in 1 (5%) patient. Radiographic follow-up revealed significant tumor shrinkage 6 weeks post-IMRT in 2 patients and partial remission in 3 more patients at 9-17 months; other tumor volumes remained stable. There was no radiation-induced peritumoral edema, increase in tumor size, or new onset of neurologic deficits. Transient acute treatment side effects included nausea and vomiting and single occurrences of conjunctivitis/increased tearing and serous tympanitis.CONCLUSION: IMRT in the treatment of central nervous system meningiomas is feasible and safe, offering highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped skull-base tumors while sparing adjacent critical structures. If the tumor remissions seen here are found in the ongoing treatments, IMRT may be considered the treatment of choice for inoperable or subtotally resected meningiomas and for otherwise difficult-to-treat, complex-shaped tumors of the central nervous system adjacent to critical structures, with the potential of dose escalation for malignant tumors.",Excluded
2099,"Exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields alters the calcium dynamics of cultured entorhinal cortex neurons. Previous studies have revealed that extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) exposure affects neuronal dendritic spine density and NMDAR and AMPAR subunit expressions in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Although calcium signaling has a critical role in control of EC neuronal functions, however, it is still unclear whether the ELF-EMF exposure affects the EC neuronal calcium homeostasis. In the present study, using whole-cell recording and calcium imaging, we record the whole-cell inward currents that contain the voltage-gated calcium currents and show that ELF-EMF (50Hz, 1mT or 3mT, lasting 24h) exposure does not influence these currents. Next, we specifically isolate the high-voltage activated (HVA) and low-voltage activated (LVA) calcium channels-induced currents. Similarly, the activation and inactivation characteristics of these membrane calcium channels are also not influenced by ELF-EMF. Importantly, ELF-EMF exposure reduces the maximum amplitude of the high-K(+)-evoked calcium elevation in EC neurons, which is abolished by thapsigargin, a Ca(2+) ATPase inhibitor, to empty the intracellular calcium stores of EC neurons. Together, these findings indicate that ELF-EMF exposure specifically influences the intracellular calcium dynamics of cultural EC neurons via a calcium channel-independent mechanism.",Excluded
3156,"Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors: The Impact of Treatment on Patient Outcome. Primary central nervous system (CNS) germinoma is readily curable with relatively large volume/high dose radiotherapy but the late effects of treatment may alter neurocognitive functioning and quality of life. Prior studies have associated radiation therapy with deficits in the domains of intelligence, attention, memory, and psychomotor processing speed, with risk factors including young age at irradiation and increased irradiation volume and dosage level. Furthermore, cranial irradiation may also lead to diminished height, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and hearing loss. Few germ cell tumor follow-up studies have adequately examined the late effects of therapy, with results varying between lowered physical quality of life without significant cognitive sequelae to significant correlations between young age at treatment and lowered levels of intellectual functioning and quality of life. Consequently, further investigation is warranted that includes baseline and biannual psychological assessments that focus beyond a singular measure of intelligence and provide data on a range of domains such as attention-concentration, memory and executive functioning, as well as quality of life, social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Since systemic and CNS germ cell tumors are highly sensitive to chemotherapy as well as to radiotherapy, future studies should examine whether the addition of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy will permit response-based reductions in radiotherapy fields and allow the administration of doses that will translate into meaningful improvements in functional outcome with preservation of excellent long-term disease control.",Excluded
2803,"Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) using modulated arc (MARC) IMRT for recurrent gliomas: Initial clinical outcomes of a novel technique. Introduction: Limited salvage options exist for patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors after standard treatment. Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) is a biologically-unique strategy that lowers the effective dose rate, potentially decreasing toxicity by allowing for greater sublethal damage repair in normal tissue. It has been shown to be safe and effective in patients with recurrent gliomas using a 3DRT technique. We developed a novel technique using PRDR with modulated arc (mARC) IMRT delivery to further reduce the amount of normal tissue exposed. We report our initial clinical results using mARC PRDR in patients with previously-irradiated recurrent gliomas. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all brain tumor patients treated with mARC PRDR at our Institution. All mARC PRDR plans were generated with Monaco (Elekta Inc) using 1/10 of the total prescription dose. For each treatment fraction a total of 10 identical treatment beams were delivered with a minimum time interval of 3 min between beam initiations. This technique allows for the entire treatment volume to receive exactly 1/10 of the prescription dose every 3 min while limiting the prescription dose rate to less than 0.0667 Gy/min. Result(s): A total of 34 patients were treated with mARC PRDR. Primary histology included grade 2 (nZ6), grade 3 (nZ10), and grade 4 (nZ15) gliomas. Median dose at initial RT was 60 Gy (range 48 e 70) at 1.8 e 2 Gy per fraction. Patients were heavily pre-treated with a mean of 3 prior recurrences (range 1 e 7) before PRDR. Nineteen patients had repeat resection at recurrence including 6 just prior to PRDR. Bevacizumab was previously given to 16 patients with 26 patients receiving bevacizumab while undergoing PRDR (dose 10 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg q2 weeks). All patients had a KPS of 70 or greater. Mean age at PRDR was 53 (range 3 e 71). Median interval between initial RT and PRDR was 4.75 years (range 0.5 e 18.3). Median total dose was 54 Gy (range 30 e 60) at 2 Gy per fraction. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 months (range 0.5 - 19.3), 6-month OS was 70.5% and 1-year was OS 23.5%. Median time to progression was 6 months with 6-month PFS 47% and 1-year PFS 17.6%. Five of the 34 patients did not finish treatment due to clinical decline and/or tumor progression. No acute G3 toxicities were seen from PRDR. Conclusion(s): This is the first clinical report of mARC IMRT PRDR for recurrent gliomas. This technique appears to be safe, feasible, and welltolerated for previously-irradiated patients with recurrent gliomas.

OBJECTIVE: Report simple reference structure fabrication and validate the precise localization of subdural micro- and standard electrodes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in phantom experiments.APPROACH: Electrode contacts with diameters of 0.3 mm and 4 mm are localized in 1.5 T MRI using reference structures made of silicone and iron oxide nanoparticle doping. The precision of the localization procedure was assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization procedures.MAIN RESULTS: A localization precision of 0.41 +/- 0.20 mm could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.46 +/- 0.69 mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with currently available feature detection software so that a clinical implementation of this technology should be feasible.SIGNIFICANCE: Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not been demonstrated.",Excluded
156,"Potential role of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors of the maxillary sinus. Purpose: To assess 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques to see whether doses to critical structures could be reduced while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage in patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus because of the risk of radiation-induced complications, particularly visual loss. Methods and Materials: Six patients who had recently received conventional RT for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus were studied. Conventional RT, 3D-CRT, and step-and-shoot IMRT plans were prepared using the same 2-field arrangement. The effect of reducing the number of segments in the IMRT beams was investigated. Result(s): 3D-CRT and IMRT reduced the brain and ipsilateral parotid gland doses compared with the conventional plans. IMRT reduced doses to both optic nerves; for the contralateral optic nerve, 15-segment IMRT plans delivered an average maximal dose of 56.4 Gy (range 53.9-59.3) compared with 65.7 Gy (range 65.3-65.9) and 64.2 Gy (range 61.4-65.6) for conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. IMRT also gave improved PTV homogeneity and improved coverage, with an average of 8.5% (range 7.0-11.7%) of the volume receiving <95% of the prescription dose (64 Gy) compared with 14.7% (range 14.1-15.9%) and 15.1% (range 14.4-16.1%) with conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Little difference was found between the 15 and 7-segment plans, but 5 segments resulted in a reduced minimal PTV dose. Conclusion(s): IMRT offers significant advantages over conventional RT and 3D-CRT techniques for treatment of maxillary sinus tumors. Good results can be obtained from 7 segments per beam without compromising the PTV coverage. This number of segments is practical for implementation in a busy RT department.

497,"Assessment of blood pressure control and target organ damage in a treated hypertensive population-Is clinic BP measurement enough?. Introduction/Background & Aims: Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease and a major contributor to morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Hypertension is also a major CV risk factor in Saudi Arabia, with a prevalence of some 26% in the general population but higher in established CV disease, ranging between 45% and 75%. Despite a large repertoire of antihypertensive drugs available, blood pressure (BP) control rates are still suboptimal. Recent studies have shown that clinic BP alone may be a poor guide to hypertension control. Ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) is the gold standard for diagnosis of hypertension, assessment of BP control, and its various patterns may provide prognostic information beyond clinic BP. Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to compare BP control with clinic versus ABPM criteria. The secondary aim was to study the relationship between various ABPM patterns and subclinical target organ damage, ie, urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), and arterial stiffness as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and biomarkers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in a Saudi hypertensive population. Method/Summary of work: We studied consecutive patients aged 18-80 years old referred to the Hypertension Clinic at King Abdul Aziz Cardiac Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January 2016 and December 2018. ABPM was performed for a 24-hour period with an oscillometric device (Spacelabs), with readings every 30 minutes from 6 AM to 10 PM, and every 60 minutes from 10 PM to 6 AM. Patient diary was used to define sleep/wake periods. White coat effect was defined as office systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=90 mmHg with daytime ABPM SBP <135 mmHg and DBP <85 mmHg. Uncontrolled clinic BP was defined as systolic >140 mmHg and diastolic BP >90 mmHg. Masked uncontrolled hypertension (MUCH) was defined as controlled clinic BP with daytime BP >=135/85 mmHg (definition-1); 24-hour ambulatory BP >= 130/80 mmHg (definition- 2); and either daytime BP >= 135/85 mmHg or nighttime BP >=120/70 mmHg (definition-3). Dipping was defined as a 10-20% fall in nocturnal BP; non-dipping as <10%, reverse-dipping as <=0%, and extreme dipping as >20%. Arterial stiffness was measured as PWV using SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, Australia) and Mobilograph (IEM Medical). Hs-CRP, BNP, and ACR were measured using standard laboratory investigations. Results analysed using JMP Version 13, p < 0.05 considered significant. The study had Institutional Ethics Committee permission. Results/Discussion: The study population included 428 subjects (mean age 53.5 +/- 14 years, female = 45%). Nine percent of the population had WC; 45% had uncontrolled hypertension using clinic BP compared with ABPM criteria; 24 hr, 68%; daytime, 56%; and nighttime, 86% (p < 0.0001). Overall, 71% of the patients had MUCH which was driven by nocturnal hypertension vs. 24 hr or daytime (70% vs. 42% vs. 32%, p < 0.0001) respectively. Seventy-nine percent of the cohort had non-dipping of which 45% were reverse dippers; 6% extreme dippers and 18% dippers. Patients with ambulatory hypertension had significantly higher ACR (30.8 +/- 8 vs. 6.2 +/- 6, p < 0.01), PWV (11.2 vs. 8.9, p < 0.001), BNP (1.2 +/- 1 vs. 6.5 +/- 1, p < 0.05), and hs- CRP (1.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.4 +/- 2.3, p < 0.01) compared with those with raised clinic BP alone. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of masked suboptimal BP control in Saudi patients with treated and well-controlled clinic BP is high and is largely because of nocturnal hypertension. Ambulatory hypertension is also characterized by sub-clinical target organ damage, arterial stiffness, and vascular inflammation, not related with clinic BP. Therefore, ABPM should become a routine investigation to confirm BP control, especially in higher risk groups and/or those with borderline hypertension.",Excluded
2986,"Local delivery of angiogenesis-inhibitor minocycline combined with radiotherapy and oral temozolomide chemotherapy in 9L glioma: Laboratory investigation. Object. Over the past several years, there has been increasing interest in combining angiogenesis inhibitors with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. Although the US FDA approved bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma in 2009, the European Medicines Agency rejected its use due to its questionable impact on patient survival. One factor contributing to the failure of angiogenesis inhibitors to increase overall patient survival may be their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Here the authors examined in a 9L glioma model whether intracranial polymer-based delivery of the angiogenesis inhibitor minocycline potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in increasing median survival. The authors also investigated whether the relative timing of minocycline polymer implantation with respect to radiotherapy affects the efficacy of radiotherapy. Methods. Minocycline was incorporated into the biodegradable polymer polyanhydride poly(1,3-bis-[p-carboxyphenoxy propane]-co-[sebacic anhydride]) (CPP:SA) at a ratio of 50:50 by weight. Female Fischer 344 rats were implanted with 9L glioma on Day 0. The minocycline polymer was then implanted on either Day 3 or Day 5 posttumor implantation. Cohorts of rats were exposed to 20 Gy focal radiation on Day 5 or were administered oral temozolomide (50 mg/kg daily) on Days 5-9. Results. Both minocycline polymer implantations on Days 3 and 5 increased survival from 14 days to 19 days (p < 0.001 vs control). Treatment with a combination of both minocycline polymer and radiotherapy on Day 5 resulted in a 139% increase in median survival compared with treatment with radiotherapy alone (p < 0.005). There was not a statistically significant difference in median survival between the group that received minocycline implanted on the same day as radiotherapy and the group that received minocycline polymer 2 days prior to radiotherapy. Lastly, treatment with a combination of minocycline polymer with oral temozolomide resulted in a 38% extension of median survival compared with treatment of oral temozolomide alone (p < 0.001). Conclusions. These results show that minocycline delivered locally potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and oral temozolomide in increasing median survival in a rodent glioma model. More generally, these results suggest that traditional therapy in combination with local, as opposed to systemic, delivery of angiogenesis inhibitors may be able to increase median survival for patients with glioblastoma.

Aim: The first aim of the project was to identify the needs and preference for service delivery within the target population (people diagnosed with brain cancer and their families). The second aim was to translate these research findings into the development of resources that would be available to people regardless of where they live. Method(s): Qualitative methods were used to identify the needs of the target population [focus group, N = 20 (n = 8 patients, n = 12 carers/family members)]. These needs were subsequently used to inform an online survey [N = 25, n = 10 patients, n = 12 carers/family members). In addition to need assessment, the online survey also sought information in regard to resource delivery preferences. Result(s): The qualitative data indicated a need for information on the following: types of cancer; treatments and side-effects; practical issues; dealing with changes in personality and behaviour; palliative care; communication strategies. Preferred pathways for information included both video and online material, and a central contact person within the health system. These issues were subsequently used to inform the online survey. This data revealed that the top 5 most endorsed needs were information relating to: diagnosis; symptoms and side effects (seizures, fatigue); managing personality and behavioural changes; current research and advances in treatment; staying fit (diet, nutrition). The most popular type of service delivery was online (videos, information on the internet), followed by postal (booklet, DVD). Outcome(s): Needs and service delivery information was used to inform the development of resources. These resources included the development of a website and the production of video modules addressing various issues across the cancer journey (diagnosis; radiotherapy; palliative care). The modules included information from health care professionals (e.g., neurosurgeons, radiation and medical oncologists) in addition to perspectives from people diagnosed with brain cancer and their families.",Excluded

Recent studies place emphasis on the modulations of immune system in various psychiatric disorders and/or treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the implications of immune-related glial cells in a rapid-acting treatment for depression, namely, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Specifically, the effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS; animal model of ECT) on microglia were morphologically determined in the mouse hippocampus by using ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunocytochemistry. For comparison, S100beta-positive astrocytes, another type of glial cells, were also tested. After 24 hours of acute ECS administration, a meshwork of Iba1-positive microglial processes was largely diminished, although the change was transient. In mice that received chronic ECS administration, the decline of Iba1-positive microglial process meshwork continued even 1 month after the last shock. Morphometric image analysis revealed the significant reduction of Iba1-positive microglial process density following ECS administration. On the other hand, neither acute nor chronic ECS administration made alterations in the patterns of expression of S100beta immunoreactivity. No significant changes were detected in the cell surface area of S100beta-positive astrocytes following ECS administration. The optical disector analysis demonstrated that ECS did not affect the numerical densities of Iba1-positive microglia and S100beta-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus. These results provide some key to understand the potential role of microglia and astrocytes in the antidepressant action of ECT.",Excluded

Management options for residual or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are limited despite advances in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiotherapeutic techniques. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is often beneficial in such cases providing improved survival of patients, but still remains underutilized as part of the multimodality management of malignant gliomas. During the last 20 years, 297 patients with histologically proven residual or recurrent GBM underwent Gamma Knife surgery in the University of Pittsburgh. Retrospective analysis of outcomes revealed median survival after initial diagnosis of 18 months, and 1- and 2-year survival rates of 72.5 and 29.5%, respectively. Median survival from the time of SRS was 9 months. The use of modified RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) classification demonstrated superior survival in our series in comparison with historical data. Important prognostic variables include tumor volume <14 cm3, marginal radiation dose of >=15 Gy, and younger age of the patients (<60 years). Adverse radiation effects (ARE) were noted in 23% of cases and were mainly controlled with corticosteroids. Combining SRS with bevacizumab resulted in further improvement of the overall and progression-free survival and decreased incidence of ARE. Nevertheless, for future application of SRS in patients with GBM, evaluation of its efficacy in a well-designed prospective controlled clinical trials seems mandatory.",Excluded

With an ever increasing number of cell phone users since late twenty first century, magnitude of the problem of exposure to radiation emitted by cell phone is self evident. Extensive research had been devoted to incriminate or absolve it as a health hazard. Radiofrequency radiation emitted by cell phone had been stated to be a potent carcinogen, cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic and neurobehavioral teratogen. Its effect on the brain had been a subject of extensive research evidently due to its proximity to the user's brain. While considering the biological effects of radiofrequency radiation, its intensity, frequency and the duration of exposure are important determinants. Nevertheless the results of these different studies have not been unequivocal. Considering the contradictory reports, the present work was undertaken to study the effect of such an exposure on the developing neural tissue of chick embryo. The processes of cell division and differentiation are fundamental to the development of any living being and are a sensitive index of any insult sustained at this stage. Neurons of dorsal root ganglion were selected for the present study as these ganglia were fully differentiated as early as fourth day of embryonic life. By varying duration of exposure, the embryos were exposed to different doses of radiation, sacrificed at different periods of incubation and subjected to histological processing.

To what extent seasonal factors modify the neuronal functional properties within the nuclei of the avian song system remains an open question. In adult songbirds, neurons of the song premotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) exhibit selective responses for the bird's own song (BOS). Here we examine whether, outside the breeding season, when songs are less stereotyped, HVC neurons of male canaries still respond selectively to the BOS produced during this period. In an initial experiment, single-unit recordings (n = 114) revealed that the neuronal selectivity for the current BOS was attenuated in males exposed to a short-day photoperiod (typical of the nonbreeding season) compared with that found in males exposed to a long-day photoperiod. In long-day conditions, 35% of the cells responded to the BOS, whereas only 12% did in short-day conditions; there were four times more selective cells (d' > 1) in long-day than in short-day conditions. To determine whether these effects were the consequence of differences in acoustic features between breeding and nonbreeding songs, neurons (n = 72) recorded in short-day conditions were tested with both a short-day BOS and a long-day BOS. A low percentage of neurons exhibited responses to short-day or to long-day BOS (11% for each song). Responses of putative interneurons (spike duration < 0.4 ms) and of putative relay cells were similarly attenuated by the short-day conditions. These results strongly suggest that, in canary, rather than being a fixed property, the selectivity for the BOS moves along a continuum and peaks when the day length mimics the breeding conditions.",Excluded
2129,"Malignant melanoma-a rare cause of metastatic pancreatic cancer. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Diagnosing metastatic malignant melanoma after resection of superficial melanoma. CASE: A 56-year-old Caucasian female who is a practicing minister started behaving unusually during one of her services. She began walking up to the alter at inappropriate times and her family was concerned about her behavior. This change in mentation continued into the next day and the decision was made to bring her to the hospital. The patient had a history of superficial malignant melanoma to the left axilla, which was treated with axillary dissection 13 years ago. Sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time was negative and the patient did not receive any further chemotherapy or radiation. She was monitored for 5 years with serial PET scans every 6 months along with chest Xrays, routine blood work and annual skin exams without evidence of disease recurrence. On this presentation, the patient had multiple episodes of tonicclonic seizures while in the ED for which she was given Ativan, Versed and IV Keppra. The patient denied previous CNS symptoms including headache, seizures, or vision changes. Imaging of the head revealed a large hemorrhagic frontal temporal brain lesion with smaller scattered lesions concerning for metastatic disease. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 2.2 x 1.6 cm peripancreatic tail mass. An endoscopic ultrasound was performed which showed a mass in the region of the tail of the pancreas. FNA was done with pathology positive for metastatic melanoma. Patient was referred to Oncology service for further management. IMPACT: Most pancreatic metastases occur in the first 1-3 years after treatment of the primary tumor and current guidelines recommend follow up 3-5 years thereafter. This case report raises a question about how long patient should be monitored after the successful treatment of superficial malignant melanoma. DISCUSSION: A variety of primary neoplasms metastasize to the pancreas. About 2% of pancreatic tumors are metastatic tumors. Common metastatic sites include the kidney, lung and colon. Metastasis of malignant melanoma to pancreas occurs as manifestation of widespread disease burden. Several factors influence survival in patients with primary melanoma, including specific clinical and pathological factors, histological subtype, anatomical location and lymph node involvement. Prognostic factors influencing survival in patients with malignant melanoma are largely unknown, but a longer disease free interval between the successful resection of primary malignancy and eventual development of metastasis to the pancreas has been reported to be associated with improved survival. Our patient presented 13 years following the treatment of primarymelanoma. The prognosis of metastatic malignant melanoma is poor. Studies suggest amean survival of only 6- 8 months in patients with systemic disease from melanoma. In several case series five-year survival rates are reported at less than 10%.",Excluded
2218,"DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone which can suppress amyloid fibrillation of polyglutamine peptides at substoichiometric molar ratios. Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches lead to protein aggregation and severe neurodegenerative diseases. A highly efficient suppressor of polyQ aggregation was identified, the DNAJB6, when molecular chaperones from the HSPH, HSPA, and DNAJ families were screened for huntingtin exon 1 aggregation in cells (Hageman et al. in Mol Cell 37(3):355-369, 2010). Furthermore, also aggregation of polyQ peptides expressed in cells was recently found to be efficiently suppressed by co-expression of DNAJB6 (Gillis et al. in J Biol Chem 288:17225-17237, 2013). These suppression effects can be due to an indirect effect of DNAJB6 on other cellular components or to a direct interaction between DNAJB6 and polyQ peptides that may depend on other cellular components. Here, we have purified the DNAJB6 protein to investigate the suppression mechanism. The purified DNAJB6 protein formed large heterogeneous oligomers, in contrast to the more canonical family member DNAJB1 which is dimeric. Purified DNAJB6 protein, at substoichiometric molar ratios, efficiently suppressed fibrillation of polyQ peptides with 45degreeQ in a thioflavin T fibrillation. No suppression was obtained with DNAJB1, but with the closest homologue to DNAJB6, DNAJB8. The suppression effect was independent of HSPA1 and ATP. These data, based on purified proteins and controlled fibrillation in vitro, strongly suggest that the fibrillation suppression is due to a direct protein-protein interaction between the polyQ peptides and DNAJB6 and that the DNAJB6 has unique fibrillation suppression properties lacking in DNAJB1. Together, the data obtained in cells and in vitro support the view that DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone that can interact with polyQ peptides that are incompletely degraded by and released from the proteasome.",Excluded

Polyamine synthesis inhibitors, such as alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, upon cessation of treatment, tumor growth resumes. We hypothesized that incorporation of radioactive polyamines might kill the growth-arrested cells. This hypothesis was previously tested in rat 9L brain tumor cells in which DFMO increased both the uptake and the retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine. In these rat cells, DFMO-induced retention of high-specific-activity [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine for 20 days resulted in several logs killing. In the present studies all of the 5 different human glioma cell lines tested with DFMO treatment also showed enhanced uptake of exogenous [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, reduced cell counts and enhanced killing of colony forming cells (CSF). Extending the time of DFMO treatment of cells that had taken up high-specific-activity (80 Ci/mmol) [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine further increased the killing. A 10-day extension resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in cumulative cell growth. A 5-day extension resulted in a 2-3 log decrease in numbers of surviving CFC. These data further support the hypothesis and suggest that DFMO-induced cell cycle arrest enhances cellular retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, increasing the effective internal radiation dose enough to cause proliferative death. In a clinical setting, the short (~ 1 mum) path-length of the tritium beta particle should limit effects to the tumor cells and spare adjacent normal cells. These results support the concept that treatment with the combination of polyamine inhibitors and radioactive polyamines might be a useful adjunct to current therapies for glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded

1773,"Intrinsic and extrinsic light responses in melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells during mouse development. Melanopsin (Opn4) is a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to various brain areas. These neurons are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and are implicated in nonimage-forming responses to environmental light such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment. Recent evidence indicates that ipRGCs respond to light at birth, but questions remain as to whether and when they undergo significant functional changes. We used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to engineer a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the melanopsin promoter. Double immunolabeling for EGFP and melanopsin demonstrates their colocalization in ganglion cells of mutant mouse retinas. Electrophysiological recordings of ipRGCs in neonatal mice (postnatal day 0 [P0] to P7) demonstrated that these cells responded to light with small and sluggish depolarization. However, starting at P11 we observed ipRGCs that responded to light with a larger and faster onset (<1 s) and offset (<1 s) depolarization. These faster, larger depolarizations were observed in most ipRGCs by early adult ages. However, on application of a cocktail of synaptic blockers, we found that all cells responded to light with slow onset (>2.5 s) and offset (>10 s) depolarization, revealing the intrinsic, melanopsin-mediated light responses. The extrinsic, cone/rod influence on ipRGCs correlates with their extensive dendritic stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ipRGCs make use of melanopsin for phototransduction before eye opening and that these cells further integrate signals derived from the outer retina as the retina matures.",Excluded
2679,"Successful endoscopic hemostasis with cryotherapy for a case of refractory esophageal cancer bleeding. Gastrointestinal malignancy bleeding (GIMB) can be a clinical challenge. Options for treatment include surgical resection, radiation, angiography with embolization and endoscopic treatment (ET). Currently there is no standard of care for ET of GIMB. Modalities tried in the past include epinephrine injection, contact thermal devices, argon plasma coagulation (APC) and hemoclip (HC) placement. Cryotherapy (cryo) is a modality used for tumor ablation. It has also been successfully used in treatment of benign bleeding such as radiation proctitis and gastric antral vascular ectasia. There is one case report of cryo use in refractory GIMB leading to short term hemostasis (HS). We present a case of long term HS achieved by cryo in a patient with refractory GIMB. A 51 year old male with a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presented with melena. He was successfully treated with APC and was then referred for external beam radiation to prevent further bleeding. This combination achieved HS for around 8 months after which he presented with recurrent melena. A second attempt at treatment with APC achieved initial hemostasis but bleeding recurred 2 days later. Cryo was offered to him to aid with his dysphagia and possibly hemostasis. On EGD a fungating tumor oozing blood was seen in the distal third of the esophagus. Cryo was performed with 15 second freeze cycles. The patient experienced significant improvement in his dysphagia and resolution of his melena. The patient expired 2 months later due to newly diagnosed brain metastasis without recurrence of his melena. ET of GIMB continues to be a challenge. Multiple modalities can be tried including standard hemostatic maneuvers. Bleeding often recurs and can become refractory. Hemospray has been reported to be effective in these situations but is not available in the United States. Cryo, proven effective in refractory benign bleeding and approved for tumor ablation was used successfully in this patient. Cryo effect at standard application duration is limited to the superficial 5 mm of tissue. In addition to tumor necrosis has the theoretical advantage of forming crystal in the microvasculature leading to thrombosis and possibly hemostasis. This is a case of long term hemostasis achieved by cryotherapy in a patient with refractory tumor bleeding. A prospective study is needed to determine whether these effects can be reproduced in other patients. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

This Phase II multicenter study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an abbreviated course of RT plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) in older patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one eligible patients 70 years of age or older with newly diagnosed GBM and a Karnofsky performance status >=60 were treated with a short course of RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks) plus TMZ at the dosage of 75 mg/m(2) per day followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m(2) for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and toxicity.RESULTS: The Median OS was 12.4 months, and the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 58% and 20%, respectively. The median and 1-year rates of progression-free survival were 6 months and 20%, respectively. All patients completed the planned programme of RT.

2026,"Daytime colour preference in Drosophila depends on the circadian clock and TRP channels. Light discrimination according to colour can confer survival advantages by guiding animals towards food and shelter and away from potentially harmful situations<sup>1,2</sup>. Such colour-dependent behaviour can be learned or innate. Data on innate colour preference in mammals remain controversial<sup>3</sup> and there are limited data for simpler organisms<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we show that, when given a choice among blue, green and dim light, fruit flies exhibit an unexpectedly complex pattern of colour preference that changes according to the time of day. Flies show a strong preference for green in the early morning and late afternoon, a reduced green preference at midday and a robust avoidance of blue throughout the day. Genetic manipulations reveal that the peaks in green preference require rhodopsin-based visual photoreceptors and are controlled by the circadian clock. The midday reduction in green preference in favour of dim light depends on the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels dTRPA1 and Pyrexia, and is also timed by the clock. By contrast, avoidance of blue light is primarily mediated by multidendritic neurons, requires rhodopsin 7 and the TRP channel Painless, and is independent of the clock. Our findings show that several TRP channels are involved in colour-driven behaviour in Drosophila, and reveal distinct pathways of innate colour preference that coordinate the behavioural dynamics of flies in ambient light.",Excluded

Evaluated were metabolite indices and metabolite ratios. Logistic linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to evaluate PFS6 and OS, respectively. These analyses were adjusted by age and MR scanner field strength (1.5 T or 3 T). Stepwise regression was performed to determine a subset of the most relevant variables.RESULTS: Associated with shorter PFS6 were a decrease in the ratio of N-acetyl aspartate to choline-containing compounds (NAA/Cho) in the region with a Cho-to-NAA index (CNI) >3 at baseline and an increase of the CNI within elevated CNI regions (>2) at F2mo.

[11 C] PiB has been used widely as an amyloid imaging agent for brain PET. In recent years, [18 F] flutemetamol has been developed as a new PET amyloid imaging agent. In this study, PET images taken from the same patient using [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB were compared so that the amyloid deposition in the brain could be visually and quantitatively evaluated. Method(s): PET was conducted in three patients with amyloid- positive Alzheimer's disease (AD) and one patient with amyloidpositive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB. Ninety minutes after intravenous administration of 185 MBq of [18 F] flutemetamol, dynamic PET imaging was performed for 30 minutes. For [11 C] PiB, dynamic PET imaging was performed for 70 minutes immediately after administration of 350 MBq of [11 C] PiB. The distribution of amyloid deposition in the region of interest in each cortex was quantitatively evaluated using the standard uptake value (SUV) sum images taken in the latter half of the PET session when a higher level of brain amyloid deposition was more readily detectable. The SUV ratio (SUVR) was calculated using the SUV in the cerebellum as the reference value. Moreover, the mean cortical SUVR (MSUVR) was calculated from the SUVR data in the cortex where a high level of amyloid deposition was detected. Result(s): When both [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB PET images were evaluated, high levels of amyloid deposition were observed in the frontal lobe, posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), precuneus, parietal lobe, and lateral temporal lobe. On the other hand, amyloid deposition was only weakly evident in the medial temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and the cerebellar cortex. In [18 F] flutemetamol PET, the MSUVR was 2.32, and the MSUVR in the PCG was 2.68. In [11 C] PiB PET, the MSUVR was 2.04, and the MSUVR in the PCG was 2.26. These data indicate that, although the dose of radioisotope was lower in [18 F] flutemetamol PET, the SUVR in each cortex were generally high in [18 F] flutemetamol PET. Conclusion(s): [18 F] flutemetamol has a longer half-life and can be delivered for a longer duration. The data indicate that, as an amyloid imaging agent, the performance of [18 F] flutemetamol is similar to that of [11 C] PiB in AD and AD-associated MCI.",Excluded

Here, we show that the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) induces autophosphorylation of ATM on serine 1981 in unirradiated cells at concentrations that inhibit protein phosphatase 2A-like activity in vitro. OA did not induce gamma-H2AX foci, suggesting that it induces ATM autophosphorylation by inactivation of a protein phosphatase rather than by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. In support of this, we show that ATM interacts with the scaffolding (A) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), that the scaffolding and catalytic (C) subunits of PP2A interact with ATM in undamaged cells and that immunoprecipitates of ATM from undamaged cells contain PP2A-like protein phosphatase activity. Moreover, we show that IR induces phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of PP2A from ATM and loss of the associated protein phosphatase activity.

The spontaneous SCE levels did not differ between patients and controls, but the cells from each of the patients showed a significantly enhanced response to the induction of SCE by both mutagens - the patients' cells being up to 50% more sensitive than controls. Cultures from five FrA patients and five controls were analysed to determine the spontaneous incidence of chromosomal aberrations and exposed to a graded series of X-ray doses to measure their response to radiation-induced chromosome damage. The spontaneous aberration incidence in controls did not differ from that found in other control series, but the background incidence of aberrations in cells from the FrA patients was significantly above control levels and appeared to reflect an enhanced response to diagnostic exposure to radionuclides. The FrA cells showed a significantly enhanced in vitro response to chromosome aberration induction by X-rays, the net aberration yields being some 60% greater than those in irradiated controls at doses up to 200 rads. It is concluded that FrA is yet another syndrome which shows hypersensitivity to the induction of chromosome damage by mutagens.

When dehydrated, panting and sweating were delayed until threshold skin temperature of 35.1 and 35.7 respectively, and both were now also related to a rising rectal temperature. In the hartebeest, panting is the only regulated thermoregulatory mechanism. When fully hydrated, panting frequency of the hartebeest was related to skin temperature, the onset occurring at 33.4degreeC. However, when dehydrated, regulation of panting shifted to a rising rectal temperature, the onset of polypnea occurring at a threshold rectal temperature of 39.5degreeC. During dehydration, the sensitivity and magnitude of the panting frequency in both species were enhanced. It is postulated that peripheral thermal sensitivity in these African antelopes when hydrated helps maintain thermal homeostasis in response to increase in the radiative load. When dehydrated, rigid thermal homeostasis is abandoned to conserve water with a resultant hyperthermia. However, in both species, it is suggested that the brain is protected from hyperthermia by an enhanced sensitivity of the panting mechanism.",Excluded

Results of confocal microscopy analysis have shown that co-delivery of anti-miR-21 significantly improved accumulation of LPNs in the nucleus of U87MG cells.

Using a cranial window model, we showed that anti-VEGF treatment may achieve these effects via normalizing the tumor vasculature, improving vessel perfusion, and delivery of oxygenation. It is known that oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer; therefore, we further demonstrated that combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy can achieve a better tumor control and help lower the radiation dose and, thus, minimize radiation-related neurological toxicity.

Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) decreases the incidence of brain metastases (BMs) and can improve overall survival. However whole brain radiation therapy is associated with a decline in neurocognitive function. Hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) aims to minimise damage to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) within the hippocampus and reduce the toxicity of PCI, although there may be an increased risk of treatment failure in the hippocampal region. The incidence of hippocampal metastases was investigated in patients with BMs from SCLC to evaluate the feasibility of HS-WBRT in this population. Method(s): Patients with SCLC presenting between 2000 and 2016 with BMs at presentation or during their disease course without previous cranial irradiation were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Hippocampal metastases (HMs) were defined as metastases within the hippocampus and a 5-mm radial expansion (hippocampus avoidance zone, according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0933 atlas). The rate of hippocampal metastases and associated clinical features were analysed. Result(s): One hundred and twenty eligible patients with a total of 754 brain metastases were identified. In 67 (55.8%) patients BMs were detected at diagnosis of SCLC and in 53 (44.2%) patients BMs developed later without previous PCI. The median number of metastases was 3, and 27 (22.5%) patients had a single BM. There were 22 (18.3%) patients with hippocampal metastases. A total of 23 (3.1%) metastases involved the hippocampal avoidance area. On logistic regression analysis, the number of brain metastases was an independent risk factor for HMs. Conclusion(s): The overall incidence of hippocampal metastases in our cohort of SCLC patients is high. As HS-WBRT may increase the risk of treatment failure in the spared region, prospective randomised trials are encouraged.

655,"Vision loss following high-dose proton-based radiotherapy for skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma. BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: Dose escalation for skull-based chordoma and chondrosarcoma can put critical adjacent structures at risk, specifically the anterior optic pathway. We report the incidence of vision loss following high-dose conformal proton-based radiotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed patients with skull-base chordoma or chondrosarcoma treated with proton-based therapy between 2007 and 2018. We analyzed 148 patients and 283 individual eyes with functional vision at baseline who received a minimum 30GyRBE to 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup> of the anterior optic pathway. Eyes were classified as ""functionally blind"" if visual acuity was 20/200 or worse. Kaplan-Meier and normal tissue complication probability modeling were used to establish the relationship between radiation dose and risk of functional vision loss.RESULTS: At last follow-up, 110 of 148 patients were alive with no evidence of disease progression. With a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 0.5-12.8), 5 eyes in 3 patients developed functional blindness, with 2 patients developing bilateral blindness. Median time to blindness was 15.2 months. The 5-year incidence of vision loss was 2.1% (95% CI: 0.9-4.9%). On univariate analysis, development of blindness was associated with presence of multiple medical comorbidities (p = 0.0040). While there were no events with a maximum dose < 60GyRBE delivered to the anterior optic pathway, the crude rate was 3.6% over 60GyRBE, with all events occurring between 60-65GyRBE.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high radiotherapy dose delivered to patients with skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma, the rate of vision loss is low and no events occurred in those who received a maximum dose under 60GyRBE.",Excluded
1859,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for metastatic melanoma: An analysis of survival, outcome, and complications. OBJECTIVE: Although the mainstays for treatment of metastatic brain disease have been surgery and/or external beam radiation therapy, an increasing number of patients are being referred for stereotactic radiosurgery as the primary intervention for their intracranial pathological abnormalities. The lack of efficacy and cognitive and behavioral consequences of whole brain irradiation have prompted clinicians to select patients for alternative therapies. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Leksell gamma unit therapy for metastatic melanoma to the brain. METHOD(S): We present our experience with 59 Leksell gamma unit treatment sessions in 45 consecutive patients who presented with metastatic melanoma to the brain. Five of these procedures were performed as salvage therapy for patients who needed second radiosurgical treatment for new lesions that were remote from the previous targets and were not included in the overall analyses. RESULT(S): The population included 78% male patients. The mean patient age was 53 years (age range, 24-80 yr). The mean time from diagnosis of primary melanoma to discovery of brain metastasis was 43 months (median, 27.5 mo; range, 1-180 mo). At the time of diagnosis of brain disease, 35.5% of the patients (16 of 45 patients) had neurological symptoms, 77.7% (35 of 45 patients) had known visceral metastases, and 11.1% (5 of 45 patients) had seizure disorders. Eighty-six percent of the lesions (80 of 93 lesions) were cortical, 12% (11 of 93 lesions) were cerebellar, 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were pontine, and 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were thalamic. Fifty-seven percent of the sessions (31 of 54 sessions) were performed for a single lesion, 24.1% (13 of 54 sessions) for two lesions, 9.2% (5 of 54 sessions) for three lesions, 7.4% (4 of 54 sessions) for four lesions, and 1.8% (1 of 54 sessions) for five lesions. The mean treatment volume was 5.6 cc, with a mean prescription of 21.6 Gy to the 56.0% mean isodose line. The median survival time of the patients in our population, using Kaplan-Meier curves, was 43 months from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma (range, 3-180 mo) and 8 months (range, 1-20 mo) from the time of gamma knife treatment. Complications included seizures within 24 hours of the procedure in four patients, with transient nausea and vomiting in three patients, transient worsening of preprocedure paresis responsive to steroids in three patients, and increased confusion in one patient. All 45 patients were located for follow-up (mean follow-up duration, 1 yr). After gamma knife treatment, 78% of the patients (35 of 45 patients) experienced either improved or stable neurological symptomatology before death or at the time of the latest follow-up examination. There were 26 deaths (58%). The cause of death was determined to be neurological in only 2 of 45 patients (7.7%). Follow-up magnetic resonance images revealed a 97% local tumor control rate of gamma knife-treated lesions, with 28% radiographic disappearance (9 of 32 cases). Six patients developed new lesions remote from radiosurgical targets and underwent second procedures. CONCLUSION(S): Although metastatic melanoma to the brain continues to have a foreboding prognosis for long-term survival, gamma knife radiosurgery seems to be a relatively safe, noninvasive, palliative therapy, halting or reversing neurological progression in 77.8% of treated patients (35 of 45 patients). The survival rate matches or exceeds those previously reported for surgery and other forms of radiotherapy. Only 7.7% of the patients in our study population who died as a result of metastatic melanoma (2 of 26 patients) died as a result of neurological disease. The routine use of therapeutic level antiseizure medication is emphasized, considering the findings of our review.",Excluded
23,"LINAC radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors: retrospective - cohort study of 23 patients. Background: Glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs) are uncommon and locally disruptive tumors that usually arise within the jugular foramen of the temporal bone. Surgery was the treatment of choice up until recently. In the last decades, however, radiosurgery has surfaced as a promising alternative treatment by providing excellent tumor control with low risk of cranial nerve injuries. Our aim was to examine the results of radiosurgery specifically, linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (LINAC SRS) for GJT treatment. We hypothesized that radiosurgery will reduce the size of the tumor and improve neurological symptoms. Design and method: Between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2013, 30 patients with GJTs were treated in Sheba Medical Center using LINAC SRS treatment. Comprehensive clinical follow-up was available for 23 patients. Sixteen patients were female and seven males with a median age of 64 years, with a range of 18-87 years. In 19 of the patients, LINAC SRS was the primary treatment, whereas in the remaining four cases, surgery or embolization preceded radiosurgery. The median treated dose to tumor margin was 14 Gy (range 12-27 Gy), and the median tumor volume before treatment was 5 ml (range 0.5-15 ml). Result(s): Following the LINAC SRS treatment, 14 of 23 patients (60%) showed improvement of previous neurological deficits, nine patients (40%) remained unchanged. At the end of a follow-up, tumor reduction was seen in 13 patients and a stable volume in eight (91% tumor control rate). Two cases of tumor progression were noted. Three patients (13%) had post- SRS complications during the follow-up, two of which achieved tumor control, while in one the tumor advanced. Conclusion(s): LINAC SRS is a practical treatment option for GJTs, with a high rate of tumor control and satisfactory neurological improvement.

773,"Pharmacological alterations that could underlie radiation-induced changes in associative memory and anxiety. It is widely known that ionizing radiation is a physical agent broadly used to kill tumor cells during human cancer therapy. Unfortunately, adjacent normal tissues can concurrently undergo undesirable cell injury. Previous data of our laboratory demonstrated that exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations induced a variety of behavioral differences respect to controls, including changes in associative memory and in anxiety state. However, there is a lack of data concerning modifications in different related pharmacological intermediaries. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the behavioral differences observed in young animals irradiated at birth might be underlain by early changes in PKCs1 levels which, in turn, could lead to changes in hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Different pharmacological markers related to the affected behavioral tasks were assessed in control and irradiated hippocampus at 15 and 30 days, namely GABAA receptor, GAD65-67, ROS and PKCs1. Results showed that all measured parameters were increased in the hippocampus of 30-days-old irradiated animals. In contrast, in the hippocampus of 15-days-old irradiated animals only the levels of PKCs1 were decreased. These data suggest that PKCs1 might constitute a primary target for neonatal radiation damage on the hippocampus. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that an initial decrease in the levels of this protein can trigger a subsequent compensatory increase that, in turn, could be responsible for the plethora of biochemical changes that might underlie the previously observed behavioral alterations.",Excluded
1121,"Anti-emetic effect of ondansetron and granisetron after exposure to mixed neutron and gamma irradiation. The anti-emetic efficiency of orally administered ondansetron and granisetron has been tested in macaques exposed to a mixed y and neutron radiation (6 Gy) with a high neutron/gamma-ray ratio. Our experiments reveal that a single delivery of ondansetron (1 or 2 mg kg(-1)) or of granisetron (0.25 mg kg(-1)) 45-90 min before irradiation or 35-45 min after irradiation was not totally effective. Conversely, the delivery of two doses with the same delay prior to and after exposure led to a complete prevention of vomiting and retching. These observations can be explained by the dual mechanism of radiation-induced emesis: an early peripheral mechanism and a later central mechanism. Two deliveries of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists seem to disrupt serotonergic transmission at the brain stem structures and to affect the peripheral release of serotonin from the gut, thus completely preventing radiation-induced vomiting. This study confirms that the 5-HT3-dependent mechanisms that mediate emesis are similar for both neutron and gamma radiation.",Excluded
2114,"Thoracic radiotherapy of SCLC. Limited stage: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 10-15% of all lung tumors and is associated with an aggressive clinical behavior. Two out of three patients presents with hematogenous metastases at diagnosis (extensive stage (ES)). For patients without hematogenous metastases (limited stage (LS)), chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment. Although radiotherapy after chemotherapy has the theoretical benefit of treating smaller target volumes with less toxicity, concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown to be superior. Moreover, earlier use of radiotherapy during chemotherapy leads to better results. The absolute benefit of early versus late radiotherapy was about 10% for patients who had received cisplatinum-based chemotherapy.1 Turrisi et al.2 demonstrated that twice daily radiotherapy starting with a first course of chemotherapy resulted in improved survival rates. Median survival was 23 months for patients who received twice-daily radiotherapy (45 Gy/30 fractions/3 weeks) versus 19 months for once daily treated patients (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). The corresponding 5 years survival rates were 26% and 16%. However, more Grade 3-4 oesophagitis was seen during twice-daily treatment (32% versus 16%). Only a minority of patients in the US and Europe receive twice daily radiotherapy. Recently the results of the CONVERT trial, in which once-daily radiotherapy (70Gy) was compared with twice daily radiotherapy (45 Gy) were presented.3 Radiotherapy was initiated at the 2nd course of 4-6 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. Overall survival at 2 years was 56% for patients treated twice-daily versus 51% for patients treated once-daily (p= 0.15).3 There was also no significant difference in time to progression. There were no differences in a acute toxicity, except for Grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred more often in the twicedaily treatment arm (74% versus 65%). There were no differences in Grade 3-5 oesophagitis (19%) and pneumonitis (2%). The authors concluded that survival in both study arms was higher than reported previously and that radiation related toxicities were lower than expected, probably related to the use of modern radiotherapy techniques. The results of the study support the use of either twice daily or once daily as standard of care for patients with limited stage disease and in good performance score. In RTOG0538 study, which also compares 70 Gy once-daily and 45 Gy twice-daily radiotherapy, radiotherapy commences with the first or second course of chemotherapy. The results of this study are eagerly awaited.4 Extensive stage: In the EORTC study on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for ES-SCLC, it was noted that the vast majority of patients still had intrathoracic disease after completion of chemotherapy. After on the positive effects of PCI which not only reduced the risk of symptomatic brain metastases (40 versus 15%) but also improved overall survival (1 year: 27 versus 13% (P= 0,003)),5 the next logical step was to investigate the use of thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC as well. Evidence for a possible role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in ESSCLC also comes from the results of a trial published by Jeremic et al. in 19996 in which patients with ES-SCLC and good prognosis with a complete response outside the thorax were randomized between TRT plus PCI during chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and PCI only. Overall survival was 17 months for the patients who received thoracic radiotherapy versus 11 months for those who did not. In the CREST trial, patients with ES-SCLC and any response after 4-6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy were randomized between PCI plus TRT (30Gy/10 fractions) or PCI only. Overall survival at one year, the primary endpoint of the study, was not statistically significant between the groups (p=0.066) but with longer follow up the survival curves diverged and at 2 years, survival was 13% in patients who received TRT versus 3% in the controls (p=0,004). There was also significant dif erence in progression free survival. In an additional analysis of patients with and without residual intrathoracic disease, which was one of the stratification factors of the study, it was demonstrated that there was no significant benefit of TRT in patients with a CR in the thorax. However, in patients with residual intrathoracic disease after chemotherapy, TRT led to a significant improvement in overall survival. 7 In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the risk of intrathoracic recurrence was reduced from 80% to 44%. In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the most recurrences occurred outside the brain and the thorax and at a later stage. The next logical step after demonstration of a beneficial effect of PCI and TRT would be the use of higher doses for TRT and possibly also treatment of extrathoracic metastatic sites. This topic was addressed in the NRG-RTOG0937 study and was presented at ASTRO 2015.8 patients with ES-SCLC and a CR or PR after chemotherapy and 1-4 metastatic lesions were randomized between PCI or PCI plus TRT plus radiotherapy of metastatic sites. The study which accrued very slowly was closed early due to observed toxicities. The study did not show a survival difference between the two groups, but included only 86 patients over a five years period and had imbalance groups with worse prognostic factors in the experimental arm. There were many, partly unrelated, Grade 4-5 toxicities in the experimental arm. To define which patients are most likely to benefit from a more aggressive approach we have performed an additional analysis for patients from the top accruing centers from the CREST trial. An evaluation of 260 patients showed significantly better outcome in patients with 0 to 2 metastases versus and without liver metastases.10 These patients are believed to be best candidates for future studies.",Excluded
3250,"Role of transcranial ultrasound in postoperative early recognition of MCA occlusion in a patient underwent to MCA aneurysmal clipping: Case report. Background: Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery represent almost a third of all the aneurysms of the circle of Willis anterior sector. These aneurysms can be either angiographically coiled or surgically clipped. Surgery on these aneurysms can sometimes be quite tricky and also dangerous. Wide base, large size and irregular dome are aneurysm related factors that can affect conduct of surgery. Wide exposure, diligent isolation of perforators, prevention of vessel kinking and obliteration and selection of the most appropriate clip are essential for success Case Report: R.S. was admitted to our Emergency Department after sudden loss of consciousness (GCS 4/15) due to atypical intracerebral hemorrhage. A CT-angiography scan showed a right parietal hematoma with evidence of ruptured aneurysm in the proximal right middle cerebral artery (rMCA). She was admitted in our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgical hematoma evacuation and aneurysmal clipping. After 6 h, we performed TCD and TCCD to detect willis circulation and measuring pulsatily index in cerebral vessels in order to exclude intracranial hypertension. Ultrasound examination showed normal pulsatily index and the absence of flow and signal at depth and area related to rMCA. After neurosurgical consultation, a brain MRI was performed and it showed DWI images as hazy, hyperintense signals in the rMCA area (Fig) confirming TCD report. Conclusion(s): Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and Transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCD) provide a noninvasive and inexpensive (relative to angiography) noninvasive vascular test that can be used in a variety of clinical situations to provide real-time physiological information that is often unobtainable with other test-ing without increased patient risks (repeated radiation doses, contrast injections) and associated costs.

1592,"Benefts of head tilting for brain PET-CT examinations. The main goal of the current study is to think over the aspects of head positioning for brain examinations, focusing on mainly one field of view (FOV) PET/CT acquisitions. The image quality, radiation exposure of the eye lenses, streaking artefact due to the beam hardening of the skull, patient comfort, orientation of the reconstructed images were all considered in this study. Method(s): while the brain centered in the PET field of view, the degree of tilting the patient's chin toward to the chest were examined. Reconstructed CT images of anonymized patients were retrospectively evaluated. From the perspective of PET image quality the PET FOV on the CT image were simulated, then the number of significant voxels of the brain tissue close to the FOV boarders were plotted as a function of the tilt angle. On the same way the path of the radiation exposure in the brain were analysed. We introduced a simple wedge-shape insert placed under the head holder into our routine brain examinations according to our initial results. Patients were reported in connection with the comfort during the examination. Result(s): we found that the range of 20-25 degree is the optimal range to tilt the head toward to the chest. As a result of tilting the head, the reconstructed axial slices for both the CT and the PET are ft for supra orbito-meatalis line. It decreases the asymmetries caused by wrong orientation, and can take unnecessary the reorientation of the images as a post-processing step, prior the medical reporting. In most cases it results that the eyes are out of the CT scan range, which is particularly important, since the eyes have high risk for radiation exposure. The location of CT streaking artefacts moves down to the direction of cerebellum. In general because the tilting of the head, the perpendicular projection of the brain to the scan axis is significantly shorter, which means 10-15% dose reduction. Furthermore the noise-as a result of the low sensitivity of PET on the FOV boarders-has smaller effect on the diagnostic value of reconstructed PET image. There is no noticeable advantage or disadvantage related to the patient comfort. Conclusion(s): tilting the head with 20-25 degree results an overall improvement in image quality and dose reduction. Our results are relevant not for PET/CT only, but for SPECT/CT examination too.",Excluded

The fluid shift is perceived by baroreceptors as a relative central hypervolaemia and induces neuro-hormonal mechanisms which provoke a real hypovolaemia. Cardiovascular deconditioning exists during spaceflight with the following symptoms when astronauts return to earth: decreased orthostatic tolerance with possible tendency towards spontaneous syncope and decreased effort capacity. The mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance are not well known. Several factors are probably involved, including hypovolaemia, modifications of the venous system, baroreflex changes, etc. Various countermeasures have been tested in microgravity simulations on the ground, then in flight.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute effect of subthalamic nuclei deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and levodopa on pain and tolerance thresholds in patients with Parkinson disease. We hypothesized that a modification of pain threshold after STN-DBS would suggest a central modification of pain perception, whereas the absence of pain threshold change after STN-DBS would correspond to a peripheral mechanism via a decrease of painful stimuli.METHODS: Nineteen patients with Parkinson disease were included in this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Postoperatively, we evaluated pain thresholds (thermal and mechanical) and motor symptoms under 3 acute conditions: stimulation on/medication off; stimulation off/medication on; and stimulation off/medication off. We also conducted a retrospective analysis of the data prospectively recorded during the follow-up of the cohort pre- and postoperatively (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, equivalent levodopa daily dose, and tapping test score).RESULTS: We found a significant increase of pain and tolerance mechanical thresholds not only after acute STN-DBS but also after acute levodopa administration. We did not find any significant correlation between postoperative clinical pain improvement and UPDRS-III improvement after acute levodopa or STN-DBS, nor with motor complications improvement assessed with UPDRS-IV after chronic STN-DBS. No correlation was found between postoperative clinical pain improvement and mechanical pain threshold modification.CONCLUSION: Clinical pain alleviation after STN-DBS cannot be considered merely as a consequence of motor complications improvement and could be attributable to a direct central modulation of pain perception, via increased mechanical pain and tolerance thresholds.",Excluded
1769,"Cell type-specific hypersensitivity to oxidative damage in CSB and XPA mice. Mutations in the CSB gene cause Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare inherited disorder, characterized by UV-sensitivity, severe neurodevelopmental and progeroid symptoms. CSB functions in the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), responsible for the removal of UV-induced and other helix-distorting lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Several lines of evidence support the notion that the CSB TCR defect extends to other non-NER type transcription-blocking lesions, notably various kinds of oxidative damage, which may provide an explanation for part of the severe CS phenotype. We used genetically defined mouse models to examine the relationship between the CSB defect and sensitivity to oxidative damage in different cell types and at the level of the intact organism. The main conclusions are: (1) CSB(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a clear hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, extending the findings in genetically heterogeneous human CSB fibroblasts to another species. (2) CSB(-/-) MEFs are highly sensitive to paraquat, strongly indicating that the increased cytotoxicity is due to oxidative damage. (3) The hypersenstivity is independent of genetic background and directly related to the CSB defect and is not observed in totally NER-deficient XPA MEFs. (4) Wild type embryonic stem (ES) cells display an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation compared to fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the CSB deficiency has only a very minor additional effect on ES cell sensitivity to oxidative damage and is comparable to that of an XPA defect, indicating cell type-specific differences in the contribution of TCR and NER to cellular survival. (5) Similar to ES cells, CSB and XPA mice both display a minor sensitivity to whole-body X-ray exposure. This suggests that the response of an intact organism to radiation is largely determined by the sensitivity of stem cells, rather than differentiated cells. These findings establish the role of transcription-coupled repair in resistance to oxidative damage and reveal a cell- and organ-specific impact of this repair pathway to the clinical phenotype of CS and XP.",Excluded
1384,"Association of Radioactive Iodine Treatment with Cancer Mortality in Patients with Hyperthyroidism. Importance: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used extensively to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1940s. Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hyperthyroidism. Objective(s): To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR = 1 + ERR). The current analyses were conducted from April 28, 2017, to January 30, 2019. Exposures: Mean total administered activity of sodium iodide I 131 was 375 MBq for patients with Graves disease and 653 MBq for patients with toxic nodular goiter. Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Result(s): A total of 18805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n = 1984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P =.002), including female breast cancer (n = 291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P =.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n = 1693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P =.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. Copyright Â© 2019 American Medical Association.

2682,"Epstein virus Barr-positive diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and often fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated promptly. HLH can be due to genetic factors or infections, malignancies and collagen-associated vascular diseases. Malignancy-associated HLH is not only more common in the setting of T/NK-cell lymphomas, but may also rarely be seen in the setting of B-cell lymphoma. Here, we describe a unique case of a patient who initially was diagnosed with HLH secondary to Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection and subsequently developed EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma affecting the brain. This case highlights the spectrum of findings associated with EBV infections and the challenges in diagnosing underlying diseases associated with HLH.

3239,"Low level laser therapy alters satellite glial cell expression and reverses nociceptive behavior in rats with neuropathic pain. BACKGROUND: Nerve injury often results in persistent or chronic neuropathic pain characterized by spontaneous burning pain accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a noninvasive method that has proved to be clinically effective in reducing pain sensitivity and consequently in improving the quality of life. Here we examined the effects of LLLT on pain sensitivity induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. CCI was performed on adult male rats, subjected thereafter to 10 sessions of LLLT, every other day, and starting 14 days after CCI. Over the treatment period, the animals were evaluated for nociception using behavioral tests, such as allodynia, thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. Following the sessions, we observed the involvement of satellite glial cells in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence approaches. In addition we analyzed the expression levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1beta) and fractalkine (FKN) after the same stimulus.RESULTS: LLLT induced an early reduction (starting at the second session; p <= 0.001) of the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia in CCI rats, which persisted until the last session. Regarding cellular changes, we observed a decrease of GFAP (50%; p <= 0.001) expression after LLLT in the ipsilateral DRG when compared with the naive group. We also observed a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines after CCI, whereas LLLT dramatically inhibited the overexpression of these proteins.CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that LLLT reverses CCI-induced behavioral hypersensitivity, reduces glial cell activation in the DRG and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines; we suggest that this involvement of glial cells can be one potential mechanism in such an effect.",Excluded
957,"Combined Transradial and Transfemoral Approach With Ostial Vertebral Balloon Protection for the Treatment of Patients With Subclavian Steal Syndrome. Background: Patients with an obstructive subclavian artery (SA) may exhibit symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency known as subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). Endovascular treatment with stent assisted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (SAPTA) demonstrates significantly lower percentage of intraoperative and postoperative complications in comparison with open surgery. There is a 1-5% risk of distal intracranial embolization through the ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) during SAPTA. Objective(s): To assess the safety and feasibility of a novel technique for distal embolic protection using balloon catheters during SA revascularization with a dual transfemoral and transradial access. Method(s): We describe a case series of patients with SSS who underwent SAPTA due to severe stenosis or occlusion of the SA using a combined anterograde/retrograde approach. Transfemoral access to SA was obtained using large bore guide sheaths. Ipsilateral transradial access was obtained using intermediate bore catheters. A Scepter XC balloon catheter was introduced through the transradial intermediate catheter into the ipsilateral VA at the ostium during SAPTA for distal embolic protection. Result(s): A total of eight patients with SSS underwent subclavian SAPTA. Four patients had the combined anterograde/retrograde approach. Successful revascularization was achieved in three of them. It was difficult to create a channel in the fourth unsuccessful case due to heavily calcified plaque burden. No peri-operative ischemic events were identified. On follow-up, we demonstrated patency of the stents with resolution of symptoms and without any adverse events. Conclusion(s): Subclavian stenting using a combined transradial and transfemoral access with compliant balloon catheters at the vertebral ostium for prevention of distal emboli may represent an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of SA stenosis and occlusions.

2772,"Seizure suppression by EEG-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat. OBJECTIVE: To test the anticonvulsive potential of a range of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies by novel methods for simultaneous EEG and rTMS in a rat seizure model.METHODS: Seizures were triggered by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA; 10mg/kg). Rats (n=21) were divided into three groups in which individual seizures were treated with rTMS trains at one of three frequencies: 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 Hz. EEG was continuously viewed by an operator who identified each seizure onset. Consecutive seizures in each animal were (1) treated with active rTMS, (2) treated with sham rTMS, or (3) were untreated. EEG was re-analyzed post hoc by visual inspection, and seizure durations were compared within and between treatment groups.RESULTS: KA-induced seizures were abbreviated by 0.75 Hz (P=0.019) and 0.5 Hz (P=0.033) active EEG-guided rTMS. In contrast, neither active 0.25 Hz rTMS nor the control conditions affected seizure duration (P>0.2).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that EEG-guided rTMS can suppress seizures in the rat KA epilepsy model, and that the effect is frequency dependent, with 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS being superior to 0.25 Hz rTMS.SIGNIFICANCE: These data support the use of rat seizure models in translational research aimed at evaluation and development of effective rTMS anticonvulsive protocols. We also offer a proof of principle that real-time analysis of EEG can be used to guide rTMS to suppress individual seizures.",Excluded

Purpose or Objective: Despite aggressive treatment with radiation therapy plus temozolomide (TMZ), the prognosis for glioblastoma remains poor. We investigated the potential of targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) to improve the therapeutic outcome of glioblastoma. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation in vitro assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251,U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. Result(s): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect of TMZ in U251 cell which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression. Increased radiosensitizing effects of TMZ were associated with impaired DNA damage repair, apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with radiation and TMZ. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell which was originated from a patient with high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT. Conclusion(s): Targeting STAT3 using Cpd188 could be a viable therapeutic approach to improve the outcome of current standard therapy for glioblastoma patients having high p- STAT3 expression regardless of MGMT methylation status.",Excluded
2407,"Temozolomide induced c-Myc-mediated apoptosis via Akt signalling in MGMT expressing glioblastoma cells. PURPOSE: We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of Temozolomide (TMZ) in both O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase (MGMT) depleted as well as undepleted glioblastoma cell lines. Since TMZ is used in clinics in combination with radiotherapy, we also studied the effects of TMZ in combination with ionising radiation (IR).METHODS: Cell colony-forming ability was measured using a clonogenic assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were evaluated by Flow Cytometry (FCM). Proteins involved in cell cycle control were detected by Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assays.RESULTS: Our data showed that TMZ, independent of MGMT expression, inhibited glioblastoma cell growth via an irreversible G(2) block in MGMT depleted cells or the induction of apoptosis in MGMT normal expressing cells. When TMZ was administered in combination with IR, apoptosis was greater than observed with either agent separately. This TMZ-induced apoptosis in the MGMT expressing cells occurred through Akt/Glycogen-Synthase-Kinase-3s (GSK3s) signalling and was mediated by Myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) oncoprotein. Indeed, TMZ phosphorylated/activated Akt led to phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK3s which resulted in the stabilisation of c-Myc protein and subsequent modulation of the c-Myc target genes involved in the apoptotic processes.CONCLUSION: C-Myc expression could be considered a good indicator of TMZ effectiveness.",Excluded
444,"Small Cell Lung Cancer: Therapies and Targets. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a fatal disease due to limited therapeutic options. Systemic chemotherapy is the bedrock of treatment for both the limited and extensive stages of the disease. However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC. It is hoped that the coming decade will witness the application of new molecular biology and genomic research techniques to improve our understanding of SCLC biology and identification of molecular subsets that can be targeted appropriately using established and emerging biological agents similar to the accomplishments of the last decade with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

3019,"XAV939-mediated ARTD activity inhibition in human MB cell lines. Diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases 1 and 5 (ARTD-1, ARTD-5) are poly ADP-ribose enzymes (PARP) involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is the major pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair. In addition, ARTD-5, or Tankyrase (TNKS), is a positive regulator of the WNT signaling implicated in the development and biological behavior of many neoplasms, such as Medulloblastoma (MB), in which radiotherapy is an essential part of the treatment. The use of radiosensitizing agents may improve the therapeutic index in MB patients by increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy, while reducing toxicity to the neuroaxis. ARTD-5 seems to be a good molecular target for improving the current treatment of MB. In this study, we used the small molecule XAV939, a potent ARTD-5 inhibitor with a slight affinity for ARTD-1, in different human MB cell lines. XAV939 inhibited the WNT pathway and DNA-PKcs in our MB cells, with many biological consequences. The co-administration of XAV939 and ionizing radiations (IR) inhibited MB cells proliferation and clonogenic capacity, decreased their efficacy in repairing DNA damage, and increased IR-induced cell mortality. In conclusion, our in vitro data show that XAV939 could be a very promising small molecule in MB treatment, and these results lay the basis for further in vivo studies with the aim of improving the current therapy available for MB patients.",Excluded
2135,"More movement with evaluating colonic transit in humans. BACKGROUND: Colonic functions (ie, absorption of fluids and electrolytes, digestion of selected nutrients, harbor for microbes, and elimination of excreta) necessitate complex patterns of storage and transit. Indeed, colonic transit accounts for a major part of the mouth-to-anus transit time. Colonic transit assessments are useful for understanding the pathophysiology of disease, the pharmacodynamic effects of new medications and to diagnose slow transit constipation. Currently, radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, and a colonic pH-pressure capsule are used to measure overall colonic transit. Radioopaque markers, scintigraphy, and the electromagnetic capsule, which is a newer technique, also evaluate regional colonic transit. The pH-pressure capsule also measures colonic pressures. Magnetic resonance imaging and a radio-frequency identification-based device are evolving methods for assessing colonic transit.PURPOSE: This mini-review, which accompanies a study evaluating the assessment of colon transit with the electromagnetic capsule, evaluates and compares existing and evolving methods for evaluating colonic transit in humans (Neurogastroenterol Motil. 2018; in press). In addition to overall and regional colonic transit, the electromagnetic capsule evaluates colonic motor patterns without radiation exposure. These patterns are summarized by analyzing the characteristics (ie, distance and velocity) of discrete antegrade and retrograde capsule movements as they travel in the colon. However, the electromagnetic capsule does not measure pressure or colonic wall movement (ie, contractions). The motor patterns identified by this capsule should be compared with motor patterns identified with manometry. The next challenge is to harness different techniques to evaluate the relationships between colonic pressures and transit or, even better, the trifecta of colonic contractions, pressure events, and transit.",Excluded
153,"The treatment of osseous metastases of hormone-refractory prostate cancer with external beam radiotherapy and Strontium-89. Metastatic bone disease from hormone-refractory prostate cancer can lead to significant morbidity such as pain, nerve compression and fractures which diminishes the quality of life of these patients substantially. Pain from osteoblastic metastases can significantly be improved by both external radiotherapy and Strontium-89 (89Sr), whereas lytic metastases are only responsive to external irradiation. Pain relief is obtained in approximately 80% of patients. Toxicity is mild and retreatment is usually possible. External beam radiotherapy is indicated when spinal cord or nerve root compression is demonstrated, or when osteolytic metastases with danger of fracture are visualized. External radiotherapy and Strontium-89 are important treatments to palliate patients suffering from metastatic prostate cancer. Because of their mild toxicity and highly effective analgesic effect, implementation of irradiation and 89Sr should be start of early in the disease process of these patients in order to keep them ambulatory and pain-free as long as possible.

3142,"Radiation therapy for melanoma: Adjuvant, palliative and abscopal effects. Radiation therapy (RT) has long played a role in the management of melanoma, however historically its efficacy has been questioned due to the perceived radioresistance of melanoma cells in vitro. Apart from proton therapy for choroidal melanoma, RT has limited accepted indications as a definitive treatment. Surgery remains the first line therapy of choice for operable patients and adjuvant RT can be considered for high-risk primary tumours. Prospective randomised data are awaited following a Phase II TROG study reporting high local control rates (93%) following postoperative nodal irradiation in selected patients with node-positive melanoma. High response rates of melanoma (e.g. mucosal or inoperable) to primary radiotherapy have also been reported. Local radiation can achieve tumour-antigen release and clinical results suggest biological interaction with immunomodulating agents (a checkpoint inhibitor and anti-CTLA4 antibody), corroborated by preclinical data. Much interest also lies in enhancing melanoma radiation response rates through combination with clinical hyperthermia, which can achieve radiosensitisation, at least in part, by immune modulation. Novel developments in radiotherapy include the rise in radiosurgical treatment (SRS), involving high dose, small volume irradiation. SRS is increasingly the palliation of choice for patients with two or more brain metastases, following resection of a single brain metastasis and for extra-cranial oligometastases. The results of a Phase III trial evaluating whole brain radiotherapy are awaited. The radiobiological consequences of SRS may be even more immunomodulatory, congruent with retrospective data that fraction sizes greater than 4 Gray are more effective and SRS alone has been suggested to induce an abscopal effect. To date there are limited data reporting SRS with concomitant immunomodulators and the optimal combinations remain to be defined. Serious toxicities have been reported following administration of B-RAF inhibitors with and subsequent to both SRS and fractionated RT. Combination strategies are being actively researched as these should increase the effectiveness of radiation in the management of patients with melanoma by widening the therapeutic window between normal tissue toxicity and melanoma cell kill, and by potentially inducing an out-offield abscopal effect.",Excluded
2268,"Effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 on sensory neuropeptide release and neurogenic inflammation in rats and mice. Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), released from capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves induce local neurogenic inflammation, while somatostatin exerts systemic anti-inflammatory actions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the release of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) and its effects on sensory neuropeptide release in vitro and acute neurogenic ear swelling in vivo. Capsaicin (10(-6) M) or electrical field stimulation (EFS; 40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s; 1200 impulses)-induced release of PACAP-38, SP, CGRP and somatostatin from isolated rat tracheae was measured with radioimmunoassay. Mustard oil-induced neurogenic inflammation in the mouse ear was determined with a micrometer and in the rat hind paw skin by the Evans Blue leakage technique. Capsaicin and EFS evoked 27% and more than twofold elevation of PACAP-38 release respectively, compared with the prestimulated basal values from isolated trachea preparation. Exogenously administered PACAP-38 (20-2000 nM) diminished both capsaicin- and EFS-evoked sensory neuropeptide release in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal inhibitory effects of PACAP on capsaicin-induced substance P, CGRP and somatostatin release amounted to 75.4%, 73.3% and 90.0%, while EFS-evoked release of these peptides was 80.03%, 87.7% and 67.7%. In case of capsaicin stimulation the EC50 values for substance P, CGRP and somatostatin were 82.9 nM, 60.1 nM and 66.9 nM, respectively. When EFS was performed, these corresponding EC50 data were 92.1 nM, 67.8 nM and 20.9 nM. PACAP-38 (10, 100 and 1000 microg/kg i.p. in 200 microl volume) inhibited neurogenic ear swelling in the mouse. Furthermore, 100 microg/kg i.p. PACAP also significantly diminished mustard oil-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the rat skin. These results suggest that PACAP-38 is released from the stimulated peripheral terminals of capsaicin-sensitive afferents and it is able to inhibit the outflow of sensory neuropeptides. Based on this mechanism of action PACAP is also able to effectively diminish/abolish neurogenic inflammatory response in vivo after systemic administration.",Excluded

Background and aims: Epicrania Fugax (EF) was included as a primary headache in the Appendix of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, beta version (ICHD-3 beta), among other entities pending further research. It was described as a paroxysmal head pain starting in a focal area located at a posterior cranial region and rapidly spreading forward to the ipsilateral eye or nose along a linear or zigzag trajectory. We aim to report 4 patients with brief pain paroxysms whose clinical features remind of typical epicrania fugax (EF), except for the direction along a transverse trajectory. Method(s): We considered all patients attending the headache outpatient office at 3 tertiary hospitals from March 2008 to December 2015. We identified a total of 4 cases with dynamic pain paroxysms moving in coronal direction. Result(s): The mean age at onset was 49 years (range 34-75). All the patients suffered a dynamic pain from parietal or temporal areas to the contralateral ones, crossing the midline, the entire sequence lasting 2-3 seconds. One patient noticed mild interictal tenderness at the stemming point. No triggers were identified. Pain quality was electric and intensity was graded as moderate.

629,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila. The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded

Introduction: We expanded upon our previous experience using involved-field fractionated radiotherapy (IFRT) as an alternative to whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with surgically resected brain metastases (BM). Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with single BM who underwent surgical resection followed by IFRT at our institution from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated. Local recurrence (LR)-free survival, distant failure (DF)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were determined. Analyses were performed associating clinical variables with LR and DF. Salvage approaches and toxicity of treatment for each patient were also assessed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 19.1 months. Fifty-six patients were treated with a median dose of 40.05 Gy/15 fractions with IFRT to the resection cavity. LR-free survival was 91.4%, DF-free survival was 68.4%, and OS was 77.7% at 12 months. No variables were associated with increased LR; however, melanoma histopathology and infratentorial location were associated with DF on multivariate analysis. LRs were salvaged in 5/8 patients, and DFs were salvaged in 24/29 patients. Two patients developed radionecrosis.

1332,"Up-regulation of somatostatin receptor density on rat CA20948 tumors escaped from low dose [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate therapy. Aim. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using the somatostatin analogue [177Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate is a convincing treatment modality for metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Therapeutic doses are administered in 4 cycles with 6-10 week intervals. A high somatostatin receptor density on tumor cells is a prerequisite at every administration to enable effective therapy. In this study, the density of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) was investigated in the rat CA20948 pancreatic tumor model after low dose [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate administration resulting in approximately 20 Gy tumor radiation absorbed dose, whereas 60 Gy is needed to induce complete tumor regression in these and the majority of tumors. Methods. Sixteen days after inoculation of the CA20948 tumor, male Lewis rats were injected with 185 MBq [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate to initiate a decline in tumor size. Approximately 40 days after injection, tumors re-grew progressively after initial response. Quantification of sst2 expression was performed using in vitro autoradiography on frozen sections of three groups: control (not-treated) tumors, tumors in regression and tumors in re-growth. Histology and proliferation were determined using HE- and anti-Ki-67-staining. Results. The sst2 expression on CA20948 tumor cells decreased significantly after therapy to 5% of control level. However, tumors escaping from therapy showed an up-regulated sst2 level of 2-5 times higher sst2 density compared to control tumors. Conclusion. After a suboptimal therapeutic dose of [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>] octreotate, escape of tumors is likely to occur.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy is the main treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The incidence of radiation-induced complications, especially radiation optic neuropathy (RON), increases along with prolonging survival time of the patients. This study was to investigate RON in NPC patients after irradiation by visual field and visual evoked potential (VEP) tests. METHOD(S): A total of 28 NPC patients, who underwent conventional external-beam irradiation, received visual field and VEP tests before irradiation, at the end of irradiation, and 5 years after irradiation. RESULT(S): Thirty-four (60.7%) eyes in 21 patients developed pathological visual field; 15 (44.1%) of these 34 eyes occurred within 10-24 months after irradiation. Of the 34 eyes, 8 showed concentric visual field constriction; 6 showed bitemporal hemianopia; 8 showed local photosensitivity descend; 10 showed central or cecocentral scotoma; 2 showed scotoma enlargement. Forty-four (78.6%) eyes in 26 patients appeared VEP abnormity; 24 (54.5%) of these 44 eyes occurred within 14 months after irradiation. In small, medium, and large elements, VEP latencies were significantly longer within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P=0.001); VEP amplitudes were lower within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation without significant difference (P=0.249, P=0.940, and P=0.450). One year after treatment, VEP latency delay maintained in each element (P=0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.001); VEP amplitudes were decreased (P=0.002, P=0.189, P < 0.001). The incidence of pathologic visual field was significantly lower in patients received irradiation of < or =70 Gy than in patients received irradiation of > 70 Gy (50.0% vs. 77.3%, P=0.041).

1392,"SPECT image segmentation for estimation of tumour volume and activity concentration in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE radionuclide therapy. Background: Dosimetry in radionuclide therapy has the potential to allow for a treatment tailored to the individual patient. One therapeutic radiopharmaceutical where patient-specific dosimetry is feasible is <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE, used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. The emission of gamma photons by <sup>177</sup>Lu allows for imaging with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). One important step for dosimetry using this imaging technique is the SPECT image segmentation, which needs to be robust and accurate for the estimated quantities to be reliable. This work investigates different methods for automatic tumour delineation in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE SPECT images. Three segmentation methods are considered: a fixed 42% threshold (FT), the Otsu method (OM) and a method based on Fourier surfaces (FS). Effects of including resolution compensation in the iterative SPECT image reconstruction are also studied. Evaluation is performed based on Monte Carlo-simulated SPECT images from 24 h and 336 h post injection (p.i.), for determination of the volume, activity concentration and dice similarity coefficient. In addition, patient data are used to investigate the correspondence of tumour volumes when delineated in SPECT or morphological CT or MR images. Patient data are also used to examine the sensitivity to the operator-dependent initialization. Result(s): For simulated images from 24 h p.i. reconstructed without resolution compensation, a volume and activity-concentration root-mean-square error below 15% is typically obtained for tumours above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup> when using OM or FS, while FT performs considerably worse. When including resolution compensation, the tumour volume becomes underestimated and the activity concentration overestimated. The FS method appears to be robust to noise, as seen for the 336 h images. The differences between the tumour volumes estimated from the SPECT images and the volumes estimated from morphological images are generally larger than the discrepancies seen for the simulated data sets. Conclusion(s): Segmentation results are encouraging for future dosimetry of tumours with volumes above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup>. Using resolution compensation in the reconstruction may have a negative effect on volume estimation. Copyright Â© 2017, The Author(s).",Excluded
1910,"High levels of enhanced reactivation of herpes simplex virus in skin fibroblasts from various hereditary cancer-prone syndromes. The dose response of the enhanced reactivation (ER) of herpes simplex virus type 1 has been studied in UV-irradiated normal human skin fibroblasts and fibroblasts from the following hereditary cancer-prone syndromes: retinoblastoma, aniridia, polyposis coli, neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2, dysplastic nevus syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and Bloom's syndrome. Surprisingly, much higher levels of ER were observed in all these genetically heterogeneous hereditary disorders than in normal human skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that loss of one allele of putative tumor suppressor genes may activate cellular processes that result in the induction of the ER response, and they support our previous observation suggesting that ER may somehow be related to the process of carcinogenesis (P.

1465,"Intracranial thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles combined with external beam radiotherapy: Results of a feasibility study on patients with glioblastoma multiforme. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of the newly developed thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles on recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Fourteen patients received 3-dimensional image guided intratumoral injection of aminosilane coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The patients were then exposed to an alternating magnetic field to induce particle heating. The amount of fluid and the spatial distribution of the depots were planned in advance by means of a specially developed treatment planning software following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The actually achieved magnetic fluid distribution was measured by computed tomography (CT), which after matching to pre-operative MRI data enables the calculation of the expected heat distribution within the tumor in dependence of the magnetic field strength. Patients received 4-10 (median: 6) thermotherapy treatments following instillation of 0.1-0.7 ml (median: 0.2) of magnetic fluid per ml tumor volume and single fractions (2 Gy) of a radiotherapy series of 16-70 Gy (median: 30). Thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles was tolerated well by all patients with minor or no side effects. Median maximum intratumoral temperatures of 44.6degreeC (42.4-49.5degreeC) were measured and signs of local tumor control were observed. In conclusion, deep cranial thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles can be safely applied on glioblastoma multiforme patients. Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.",Excluded
412,"Intron and gene size expansion during nervous system evolution. BACKGROUND: The evolutionary radiation of animals was accompanied by extensive expansion of gene and genome sizes, increased isoform diversity, and complexity of regulation.RESULTS: Here we show that the longest genes are enriched for expression in neuronal tissues of diverse vertebrates and of invertebrates. Additionally, we show that neuronal gene size expansion occurred predominantly through net gains in intron size, with a positional bias toward the 5' end of each gene.CONCLUSIONS: We find that intron and gene size expansion is a feature of many genes whose expression is enriched in nervous systems. We speculate that unique attributes of neurons may subject neuronal genes to evolutionary forces favoring net size expansion. This process could be associated with tissue-specific constraints on gene function and/or the evolution of increasingly complex gene regulation in nervous systems.",Excluded

This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences.METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system.RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains incurable, and recurrent tumors rarely respond to standard-of-care radiation and chemo-therapies. Therefore, strategies that enhance the effects of these therapies should provide significant benefits to GBM patients. We have developed a nanoparticle delivery vehicle that can stably bind and protect nucleic acids for specific delivery into brain tumor cells. These nanoparticles can deliver therapeutic siRNAs to sensitize GBM cells to radiotherapy and improve GBM treatment via systemic administration. We show that nanoparticle-mediated knockdown of the DNA repair protein apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1) sensitizes GBM cells to radiotherapy and extend survival in a genetic mouse model of GBM. Specific knockdown of Ape1 activity by 30% in brain tumor tissue doubled the extended survival achieved with radiotherapy alone.

3546,"Is there a role for empiric radiation without a confirmatory biopsy for a subset of patients with radiographically-malignant primary brain tumors?: An analysis of short-term morbidity and mortality. Background: In patients with MRI brain scans consistent with unresectable glioma, the current standard of care is to confirm with a stereotactic biopsy. However, stereotactic biopsy is not without clinical risk. Method(s): A series of 181 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy for malignant brain lesions between 2006 - 2014 was reviewed with particular attention to risk of near-term neurologic decline and death. Result(s): In the evaluable set of 158 patients, the median age was 63. 77.2% of the patients had Grade 4 tumors, while 20.9% had a pre-biopsy performance status (PS) of ECOG 3-4. The overall risk of death within 30 days of biopsy was 13.9%. Neurological decline directly attributable to the biopsy occurred in 19.7% of patients, while 5.3% experienced both neurologic decline and death within 30 days. The rate of death within 30 days of stereotactic biopsy for grade 2/3 tumors was 5.6%, grade 4 tumors was 16.4% and patients > 65 was 18.2%. The 30-day rate of death and neurologic decline attributable to biopsy in patients with pre-treatment ECOG 3-4 was 21.2% (vs. 12% ECOG 0-2, p = 0.067) and 35.7% (vs. 15.4% ECOG 0-2, p = 0.064), respectively. Patients who were ECOG 3-4 and age > 65 had a 30-day mortality rate of 23.1%. Conclusion(s): There is a meaningful risk of death within 30 days and neurologic decline related to stereotactic biopsy in patients with radiographic unresectable malignant glioma, particularly in those with diminished PS. Patients who are not likely to be candidates for chemotherapy, particularly those with an ECOG PS of 3-4, are more likely to be harmed by biopsy. Empiric radiation should be considered in high-risk patients saving both the financial cost and potential morbidity and mortality from the biopsy which is unlikely to alter the care plan.",Excluded
637,"Radiosurgical treatment for epilepsy associated with cavernomas. Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain, which often present with drug-resistant epilepsy. Microsurgical excision remains the preferred approach for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of Gamma Knife (GK) surgery in the management of drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs in a retrospective multicenter study. Forty-nine patients with cortical or subcortical CMs with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these GK procedures was 7.5 (+/-9.3) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 6.9/month (+/-14). The mean marginal radiation dose was 19.17 Gy. At the last follow-up examination, 53% were seizure free. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for another 20%. The remaining 26% of patients showed little or no improvement. The morbidity was low. Radiosurgery is a promising management modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome.

3593,"Continuous intrathecal bupivacaine and opioid infusion for the treatment of chronic stage IV liposarcoma cancer pain and diffuse spinal metastasis. Introduction We present a 58yo male with stage IV liposarcoma and diffuse cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine metastasis. Patient described severe cancer bone pain, especially troublesome in the low back. His cancer was diagnosed in 2014 and the tumor was initially resected from the posterior thigh. Bone metastasis was later noted in 2015, and later that year he developed a pathological fracture of the femur which left him bedridden. While hospitalized he developed a DVT and PE. He was started on chemotherapy and radiation, which continued to weaken and exacerbate his back pain. In addition, he suffered from right sided blindness and deafness, metastasis to the lung, HTN and depression which continued to decrease his quality of life. Results/Case report In the context of the patient's diffuse metastasis, we considered his pain secondary to metastatic cancer to the spine. The patient described the majority of the pain to be located in the low levels of his back, and characterized the pain as achy, throbbing, without radiation and exacerbated with exertion. Prior to any interventional therapy, the patient underwent conservative management with oral, intravenous, and topical agents all which did not provide any pain relief. At this point, we discussed the benefits of placement of a neuroaxial catheter, and the patient was amendable. Our preference was placement of a tunneled epidural catheter for outpatient infusion, but we were unsuccessful in securing a long-term care facility to accept care for the epidural and its dressing changes. This would have been a more cost effective option, and one that would not require invasive surgery. Since this was not possible, we discussed the possibility of intrathecal pump placement, and this was successfully implanted as a culmination of past therapies. After pump implantation, the patient was started on intrathecal morphine at 2mg/day which did not provide sufficient pain control. The morphine dose was increased to 3mg/day, plus an assist device of 0.2mg Q4hrs. Even at 4.2mg/day intrathecal morphine, equivalent to 420mg of IV morphine and >1200mg PO morphine, opioids alone were still not providing adequate pain relief. At this point, we considered the option of adding intrathecal Bupivacaine to the infusion. The patient was already bedridden and lower extremity motor weakness was not a significant factor. We slowly titrated the Bupivacaine infusion to effect. It was not until we reached 6mg/day of 2% continuous intrathecal Bupivacaine, in addition to 0.6mg Q4hrs assist device (which brought the cumulative dose to 9.4mg/day intrathecal Bupivacaine) that the patient began to experience pain relief. Discussion Intrathecal pump is a reliable therapy for chronic pain. Bupivacaine, used in combination with opioids, is a helpful and safe method of treatment for patients who have not responded to intrathecal opioids alone. In our case, even at an unusual and extraordinary large dose of Bupivacaine and opioid combination, the patient maintained normal BP, HR and respiratory status. This treatment option may improve quality of life while providing pain relief for patients with cancer pain and already limited functional status.",Excluded

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Generate an age appropriate differential for retinal artery occlusion CASE: A 20 year-old healthy woman presented with acute left lower quadrant vision loss. She reported a similar episode 1 week prior after which her vision recovered, as well as a month-long history of left-sided temporal headaches associated with photosensitivity. Review of systems was positive for episodic paresthesias of bilateral forearms, hands, and feet. She denied constitutional symptoms, rash, joint pain, and drug use of any kind. Family history was remarkable for father with ocular migraine, and grandparents with rheumatoid arthritis and neurosarcoidosis. Exam revealed a left monocular lower quandrantanopsia, normal venous pulsations, no cherry red spot and a normal neurological exam. An extensive rheumatic and infectious workup was negative, including a hypercoaguability panel, antinuclear antibody, ESR, CRP, and hemoglobin evaluation. A brain MRI/MRA without contrast showed patent bilateral ophthalmic arteries. Face and neck MRI with contrast, transthoracic echocardiography with bubble study, electromyography, as well as nerve conduction studies were all unremarkable. Given the negative workup, the presumable etiology was thought to be vasospasm with migraine. She was started on low dose aspirin for secondary stroke prevention, and propranolol for migraine prophylaxis. IMPACT: This case highlights the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion, as well as the possible etiologies of retinal artery occlusion. Workup should be tailored to an age appropriate differential. DISCUSSION: Overall, central and branch retinal artery occlusions (CRAO and BRAO) are rare with an incidence of approximately 1 to 10 in 100,000, with an affected mean age of 60-65 years. The etiology varies with age, with carotid artery atherosclerosis being most common overall, as high as 70%; however, for patients less than 40 years of age, cardiogenic embolism is much more likely. Therefore, workup for younger patients should be focused on evaluating for sources of cardiogenic embolism such as arrhythmias, murmurs, congenital heart disease, and substance abuse. For older patients, temporal arteritis should be ruled out. Vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, radiation injury, or hematologic diseases including sickle cell anemia, hypercoagulable states, and hyperviscosity syndrome can affect all ages and should be investigated if other causes are excluded. Rare causes of CRAO/BRAO include infections due to Bartonella, toxoplasmosis, and varicella; ocular surgery; fat or amniotic fluid embolism; and vasospasm with or without migraine, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Side effects of the drug during flight were negligible. We conclude that buccal scopolamine is more effective than a placebo in treating ongoing motion sickness.",Excluded
2208,"Circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates melanogenesis through MITF. The circadian clock is near ubiquitous, self-sustaining, and oscillates with a periodic cycle of about 24 hr. The skin circadian clock is known to be involved in various important cellular pathways including cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair, and metabolism by regulating the expression of specific target genes known as the clock-controlled genes (CCGs). In this study, we show that Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), an essential rate-limiting protein in melanin biosynthesis, is a transcriptional target of the circadian clock. Using primary human melanocytes, human melanoma cells and mouse skin tissues, we have established transcriptional regulation of MITF by the circadian clock, which translates into rhythmic 24 hr expression of MITF mRNA and protein levels. We also show that the circadian clock protein Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (BMAL1) is a positive regulator of MITF, which causes an increase in melanin levels. Further, we demonstrate that upon exposure to solar UV-B radiation in presence of BMAL1, there is reduced gammaH2AX and cleaved PARP level compared to BMAL1 deficient group, which contributes to enhanced cell viability and survival. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the novel regulation of MITF by BMAL1 provides better protection against solar UV-B mediated genomic instability and melanomagenesis.",Excluded
2334,"The distribution of thirteen GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. III. Embryonic and postnatal development. The embryonic and postnatal expression of 13 GABAA receptor subunit genes in the rat CNS was studied by in situ hybridization. Each transcript exhibited a unique regional and temporal developmental expression profile. For example, in both embryonic and early postnatal cortex and thalamus, expression of the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 3 mRNAs was pronounced. In particular, the alpha 5 gene expression underwent a prominent peak in early brain. Subsequently, the thalamocortical expression of these four genes substantially diminished and was superseded in the adult by the alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta subunit mRNAs. Similarly, gamma 1 and gamma 3 gene expression also dropped markedly during development, their initial stronger expression being restricted to relatively few structures. In contrast, gamma 2 gene expression was widespread and mostly remained constant with increasing age. The medial septum and globus pallidus were regions expressing few subunits in both early postnatal and adult stages, allowing clear developmental combinatorial changes to be inferred (alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 1 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1/gamma 2, respectively). In contrast, cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibited no developmental switch, expressing only the alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs from birth to adult. Certain GABAA transcripts were also detected in germinal zones (e.g., beta 1, beta 3, gamma 1) and in embryonic peripheral tissues such as dorsal root ganglia (e.g., alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 3, gamma 2) and intestine (gamma 3). Some parallels in regional and temporal CNS expression were noted (e.g., alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 3, alpha 4/alpha 6 delta), whereas the alpha 5 and beta 1 regional mRNA expressions converted over time. The changes of GABAA receptor subunit gene expression suggest a molecular explanation for earlier observations on changing ligand binding affinities. Thus, the composition, and presumably properties, of embryonic/early postnatal rat GABAA receptors differs markedly from those expressed in the adult brain.",Excluded
247,"Radiobiological analysis of tissue responses following radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery provided clinicians the ability to administer high single-doses of radiation to intracranial targets with relative safety. Analysis of clinical outcome from radiosurgery calls into question some of the radiobiological principles that have guided conventional fractionated radiotherapy in the past. The response of the tumor or target tissue being irradiated, as well as the response of the surrounding normal tissue, seems predominantly determined by the tumor or target vasculature. Injury to the tumor or target vasculature appears to contribute to the probability of developing normal tissue complications. Estimations of alpha/beta values from radiosurgical dose-response data consistently yield values that conflict with values from fractionated radiotherapy and with linear-quadratic theory. This indicates that projections from high-dose single-fractions to fractionated dose-equivalents made using the linear-quadratic formula are unreliable.

Background: Studies have shown that exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) in the mobile communication frequency range may induce physiological modifications of both spontaneous as well as event-related human electroencephalogram. So far, there are very few peer-reviewed studies on effects of Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), which is a digital radio communication standard used by security authorities and organizations in several European countries, on the central nervous system. Objective(s): To analyze the impact of simulated TETRA handset signals at 385. MHz on slow cortical potentials (SCPs). Method(s): 30 young healthy males (25.2+/-2.7 years) were exposed in a double-blind, counterbalanced, cross-over design to one of three exposure levels (TETRA with 10 g averaged peak spatial SAR: 1.5. W/kg, 6.0. W/kg and sham). Exposure was conducted with a body worn antenna (especially designed for this study), positioned at the left side of the head. Subjects had 9 test sessions (three per exposure condition) in which three SCPs were assessed: SCP related to a clock monitoring task (CMT), Contingent negative variation (CNV) and Bereitschaftspotential (BP). Result(s): Neither behavioral measures nor the electrophysiological activity was significantly affected by exposure in the three investigated SCP paradigms. Independent of exposure, significant amplitude differences between scalp regions could be observed for the CMT-related SCP and for the CNV. Conclusion(s): The present results reveal no evidence of RF-EMF exposure-dependent brain activity modifications investigated at the behavioral and the physiological level.

We've established a model for recurrent GBM by treating mice bearing previously untreated, luciferase-modified, intracranial GBM PDX, with radiation (RT) (2 Gy/day, M-F), temozolomide (TMZ) only (10 mg/kg/day, M-F), or concurrent RT/TMZ. PDX respond to treatment by showing a reduced rate of increase in tumor bioluminescence (RT only), or decreased tumor bioluminescence (TMZ only or RT/TMZ), but with eventual tumor growth requiring animal euthanasia at 5.5 (RT only), 26.5 (TMZ only), or 38 (RT/TMZ) days beyond the median survival of untreated control animal subjects. All survival extensions are significant relative to untreated control mice (p<0.05). To examine the effects of treatment on tumor cell subpopulations in intracranial PDX, we employed flow cytometric analyses of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) positive GBM cells, using a panel of markers (CD133, CD15, ABCG2, SOX2, EZH2, HIF1A, MGMT, and H3K27me3). RT alone did not cause a significant enrichment for any specific subpopulation, as identified using the markers indicated above. In contrast, PDX exposed to TMZ monotherapy or RT/TMZ combination therapy showed enrichment for CD133+HIF1A+ cells (p<0.005). PDX treated with RT/TMZ were also enriched for CD133+CD15+, and additionally showed enrichment for CD133+SOX2+ and CD133+EZH2+ cells (p<0.005 for each). Perhaps not so surprisingly, recurrent tumors that had been treated with TMZ or RT/ TMZ showed increased cellular positivity for MGMT (Control 0.78% vs. TMZ 3.4% p<0.005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p<0.0005), though, paradoxically, these tumors also showed increased cellular positivity for EZH2 (Control 0.38% vs. TMZ 3.0% p=ns and RT/TMZ 7.8% p<0.0005) and a product of EZH2 activity, H3K27me3 (Control 0.55% vs. TMZ 18.2% p<0.0005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p=ns), which is associated with transcriptional suppression. Corresponding immunohistochemical analysis is ongoing, with results to be presented at the meeting. In total, our data indicate that, in recurrent tumors, cell subpopulation selection/enrichment depends on the type of therapy administered, which should, in turn, influence the selection of salvage therapy for treating recurrent GBM.",Excluded

Stereotactic radiosurgery is a controversial treatment modality in the management of cerebral cavernous hemangiomas (CHs), and results vary from center to center. Even the interpretation of treatment failure is controversial. It is suggested that the systematic pathological investigation of irradiated specimens could help to resolve the controversy. A hemorrhagic lesion in the posterior part of the thalamus had been diagnosed as a tumor and was treated with 40-Gy fractionated radiotherapy. One year after this treatment the case was reconsidered based on new imaging evidence, and the lesion was removed by conventional craniotomy. Histopathological examination revealed a CH with postirradiation changes. Compared with nonirradiated control CH tissue samples, there was endothelial cell destruction and marked fibrosis with scar tissue formation in the stroma of the treated lesion.

2577,"Color constancy of color-deficient observers under illuminations defined by individual color discrimination ellipsoids. We explored the color constancy mechanisms of color-deficient observers under red, green, blue, and yellow illuminations. The red and green illuminations were defined individually by the longer axis of the color discrimination ellipsoid measured by the Cambridge Colour Test. Four dichromats (3 protanopes and 1 deuteranope), two anomalous trichromats (2 deuteranomalous observers), and five color-normal observers were asked to complete the color constancy task by making a simultaneous paper match under asymmetrical illuminations in haploscopic view on a monitor. The von Kries adaptation model was applied to estimate the cone responses. The model fits showed that for all color-deficient observers under all illuminations, the adjustment of the S-cone response or blue-yellow chromatically opponent responses modeled with the simple assumption of cone deletion in a certain type (S-M, S-L or S-(L+M)) was consistent with the principle of the von Kries model. The degree of adaptation was similar to that of color-normal observers. The results indicate that the color constancy of color-deficient observers is mediated by the simplified blue-yellow color system with a von Kries-type adaptation effect, even in the case of brightness match, as well as by a possible cone-level adaptation to the S-cone when the illumination produces a strong S-cone stimulation, such as blue illumination.",Excluded
2193,"A phantom study to determine the optimum size of a single collimator for shortening the treatment time in CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery of spherical targets. Prolonged treatment execution time is a concern in CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery. Beam reduction and node reduction technique, and monitor unit optimization methods are adopted to reduce the treatment time. Usage of single collimator in the CyberKnife treatment plan can potentially reduce collimator exchange time. An optimal single collimator, which yields an acceptable dose distribution along with minimum number of nodes, beams, and monitor units, can be a versatile alternative for shortening treatment time. The aim of the present study is to find the optimal single collimator in CyberKnife treatment planning to shorten the treatment time with the acceptable dose distribution. A spherical planning target volume PTV1 was drawn in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Plans with same treatment goals were generated for all the 12 collimators independently. D(95%) was selected as the prescribing isodose and the prescribed dose was 10 Gy. The plan of the optimal collimator size was evaluated for conformity, homogeneity, and dose spillage outside the target. The optimum collimator size and the target dimensions were correlated. The study was repeated with two other target volumes PTV2 and PTV3 for generalizing the results. Collimator sizes just above the diameter of the spherical PTVs were yielding least number of nodes and beams with acceptable dose distributions. The collimator size of 35 mm is optimum for the PTV1, whose diameter is 31.4 mm. Similarly, 50 mm collimator is optimum for PTV2 (diameter= 45.2 mm) and 20 mm collimator is optimum for PTV3 (Diameter = 17.3 mm). The total number of monitor units is found to reduce with increasing collimator size. Optimal single collimator is found to be useful for shortening the treatment time in spherical targets. Studies on two clinical targets, (a brain metastasis and a liver metastasis cases) show comparable results with the phantom study.",Excluded
1892,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) complements magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive means for the characterization of tissue. While MRI uses the signal from hydrogen protons to form anatomic images, proton MRS uses this information to determine the concentration of brain metabolites such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and lactate in the tissue examined. The most widely used clinical application of MRS has been in the evaluation of central nervous system disorders. MRS has its limitations and is not always specific but, with good technique and in combination with clinical information and conventional MRI, can be very helpful in diagnosing certain entities. For example, a specific pattern of metabolites can be seen in disorders such as Canavan's disease, creatine deficiency, and untreated bacterial brain abscess. MRS may also be helpful in the differentiation of high grade from low grade brain tumors, and perhaps in separating recurrent brain neoplasm from radiation injury.",Excluded

Disseminated neuroendocrine tumours are difficult to treat and are generally not responsive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Nuclear medicine techniques using a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue, 111In-Octreotide, have been used for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours. It has been suggested that high activities of such an agent may have a therapeutic effect. The aims of this study were to assess toxicity and to determine if there had been evidence of efficacy. Eight patients with known disseminated neuroendocrine tumours were enrolled in the study; six had carcinoid tumours, one had a medullary cell carcinoma of the thyroid and one patient had a malignant gastrinoma. Between 1.3 and 4.6 GBq of 111In-Octreotide were administered to each patient for up to five administrations over 12 months. A total of 23 administrations were given. Tests of vital signs, renal, liver and endocrine function as well as haematological markers were taken before and after treatment. The treatment was well tolerated with only one patient suffering from a sensation of flushing during the infusion but no changes in vital sings. There was a transient (up to 48 h) drop in circulating lymphocytes in four patients and platelets in two patients; no supportive therapy was needed. One patient with severe renal impairment had a slight reduction in glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that high-activity 111In-Octreotide is well tolerated with low toxicity and can be considered for use in patients with disseminated neuroendocrine tumours. Further work is now being performed to assess efficacy.",Excluded

Using primary cultures of neural precursor cells of cortex from developing rat brain, we demonstrated the involvement of caspase-3 in the apoptotic process induced by gamma irradiation. The precursor nature of cells was confirmed by nestin and GFAP immunoreactivity and by the capacity of differentiation in neuronal and glial cells after 5 days in culture. Neural precursors were irradiated with single doses ranging from 0.1 to 4Gy. Cellular death, determined 24 h post-irradiation (pi) was dose-dependent and the induction of apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and hypodiploid DNA peak represented by the ""sub G1"" region. For the higher doses, apoptosis was evident after 4-6 h pi and increased during 24 h. Caspase-3 activity increased with doses and was maximal at 4-6 h pi with 3Gy and remained similar with 4Gy. The protection from radiation-induced apoptosis by caspase-3 inhibitor, zDEVD-fmk, confirmed that this enzyme is involved in the apoptotic mechanism in this system.

PURPOSE: To determine changes in straylight after iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens implantation (pIOL) and to investigate the relationship between straylight and several preoperative and postoperative variables.DESIGN: Institutional, prospective cross-sectional study.METHODS: Artiflex (Ophtec B.V.) pIOL implantation was performed in 61 eyes (36 patients). Straylight values were measured before surgery and 3 months after surgery using the Oculus C-Quant (Oculus Optikgerate). Furthermore, correlations were analyzed between straylight and the following parameters: keratometry, axial length, spherical equivalent, astigmatism, pIOL power, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, and pupil size.RESULTS: Mean straylight decreased from 1.18 +/- 0.17 log units before surgery to 1.13 +/- 0.17 after surgery (P = .016). Higher preoperative straylight values were associated with larger postoperative decreases in straylight (r = -0.534; P < .001). Higher postoperative straylight values were correlated to higher axial length (r = 0.444; P = .001) and lower keratometry values in diopters (r = -0.414; P = .001). After regression analysis, only axial length was found to be an independent predictor of preoperative and postoperative straylight (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). After correcting for the axial length of an emmetropic eye (23.44 mm), all straylight correlations disappeared, indicating that an increase in distance from cornea to retina explains the increase in straylight values in longer eyes.CONCLUSIONS: Retinal straylight was reduced significantly after Artiflex pIOL implantation. Besides age, axial length was the only predictor of preoperative and postoperative straylight values. The increased tissue length light has to pass from cornea to retina, might explain the increase in straylight values in longer eyes.",Excluded

92,"Ionizing radiation induces endothelial transdifferentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells through the Tie2 signaling pathway. Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite treatment that combines surgical resection and radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are characterized by abundant vascularization and significant cellular heterogeneity including GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Recent data has demonstrated that GSC are directly involved in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into Tumor Derived Endothelial Cells (TDEC). We postulate that cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. GSC neurospheres isolated from 3 different patients were irradiated or not and were then transdifferentiated into TDEC. In fact, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> in vitro and develop more functional blood vessels in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+. All IR-induced effects on TDEC were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, which confirms the role of the Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, by analyzing Tie2 expression in patient GBMs by immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the number of Tie2+ vessels increases in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IR potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC through the Tie2 signaling pathway, which indicates a new pathway of treatment-induced tumor adaptation. New therapeutic strategies that associate standard treatment and a Tie2 signaling pathway inhibitor should be considered for future trials.",Excluded
2473,"Abstract No. 552 Predictive value of voxel-based dosimetry using 99mTc-MAA single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography for dose to healthy liver from 90Y radioembolization. Purpose: Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE) with <sup>90</sup>Y microspheres is used for treatment of liver tumors, including neuroendocrine tumor (NET) liver metastases. Hepatotoxicity is a concern in NET patients receiving TARE, due to longer survival and exposure to additional radioactive therapies. The body surface area (BSA) method for prescribing <sup>90</sup>Y resin microspheres may under- or overestimate the ideal administered activity, resulting in radiation doses that may undertreat tumors or over-expose normal liver. The purpose of this study was to compare voxel-based dosimetry of healthy liver dose based on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): From a larger consecutive series of 127 patients, a retrospective review was performed for 26 patients who underwent 34 <sup>90</sup>Y-microsphere treatments (SIR-Spheres, Sirtex Medical) from March 2016 to March 2019. For each treatment, the liver and tumors were segmented manually using MIM v7 SurePlan (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) using the CT portion of the <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT study. Voxel-based dosimetry was performed using pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA imaging for predicting dose from treatment and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging to estimate final therapeutic dose. Dose calculations were performed assuming local deposition within the MIM SurePlan dosimetry platform. Result(s): A total of 390 tumors were segmented across 34 treatments. Tumor count per patient ranged from 1 to 32 (9.7 +/- 9.6). Tumor liver burden ranged from 1.2% to 66% (mean, 16.1%; median, 6.1%.) Whole liver volumes ranged from 1139 mL to 4780 mL (2124 +/- 867 mL). Healthy liver volumes ranged from 1011 mL to 2763 mL (1671 +/- 472 mL). The per-patient mean liver dose was found to be 31.6 +/- 11.9 Gy, and the mean healthy liver dose was found to be 28.2 +/- 12.8 Gy. A strong correlation was observed when comparing healthy liver absorbed dose measured by post-treatment imaging with what was predicted from pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA mapping (slope = 0.87 +/- 0.05; intercept = 3.0 +/- 1.5 Gy; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.924). This is in contrast with the observed relationship between BSA-derived administered activity and healthy liver volume (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.081). Conclusion(s): Voxel-based dose estimates to healthy liver based on pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA imaging strongly correlate to dose measurements from post-treatment imaging. This application may be useful for optimizing dose delivery in TARE, particularly in NET patients, given their greater risk for long-term hepatotoxicity. Copyright Â© 2021",Excluded
747,"Defining the role of palliative radiotherapy in bone metastasis from primary liver cancer: An analysis of survival and treatment efficacy. Aims and background. Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is still associated with a poor prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are known to cause bone metastasis resulting in pain, neurologic impairment and risk of fracture. Palliative radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in symptomatic bone lesions and is usually performed as percutaneous fractionated radiotherapy. Methods and study design. From June 1987 to December 2009, 41 patients (median age, 64 years) with bonemetastasis received radiotherapy in our department. The analyzed patients were treated for 67 sites of bone lesions. We analyzed the applied fractionation schedules and the preferred sites of metastasis and symptoms, evaluated the therapeutic outcome in terms of symptomatic improvement, and described the prognosis of these patients. Results. Main indication for palliative radiotherapy was pain in 94% of all cases.Most frequent radiation protocols were 10 x 3 Gy (20 patients) and 20 x 2 Gy (19 patients). Median applied overall dose was 39 Gy (range, 4-48 Gy) and median single dose was 2.5 Gy (range, 1.8-4 Gy). The median duration of the radiotherapeutic treatment was 15 days (range, 2-24 days) and in 12 cases treatment was discontinuated. The overall response rate to palliative radiotherapy in bone metastasis was 77%. Median overall survival in both cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma patients was 4.2 months after initiation of radiotherapy (range, 0.2-38.9). Conclusions. Considering the poor prognosis of patients with bone metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, with a poor median survival of 3.7-5.0 months according to our study and existing literature, shorter radiotherapy schedules or even single-fraction irradiation can be considered.",Excluded

To clarify the TSPO function, we identified the Drosophila homolog, CG2789/dTSPO, and studied the effects of its inactivation by P-element insertion, RNAi knockdown, and inhibition by ligands (PK11195, Ro5-4864). Inhibition of dTSPO inhibited wing disk apoptosis in response to gamma-irradiation or H2O2 exposure, as well as extended male fly lifespan and inhibited Abeta42-induced neurodegeneration in association with decreased caspase activation. Therefore, dTSPO is an essential mediator of apoptosis in Drosophila and plays a central role in controlling longevity and neurodegenerative disease, making it a promising drug target.",Excluded
318,"Thoracic radiation-YES. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%-20% of all lung cancers, and the overwhelming majority (>95%) are associated with tobacco exposure. The incidence of all types of lung cancer, including SCLC, has been declining in the United States with the onset of tobacco smoking cessation programs, although this trend took nearly 20 years to become evident among men. Overall survival (OS) rates for patients with lung cancer have also increased by about 5% since the advent of low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect early lung cancer. The prognosis for patients with SCLC continues to be poor but has improved with the advent of smoking cessation campaigns, more effective chemotherapy agents and radiation planning and delivery techniques, and the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for those who experience a complete response to therapy. Consolidation with chest radiotherapy has improved OS among patients with extensive-stage SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. SCLC often presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal involvement is common with or without pleural effusion and extrathoracic disease. Extrathoracic spread (i.e., extensive-stage disease) is also quite common, being present in 80%-85% of cases at diagnosis. Brain metastases are present in approximately 20% of patients at diagnosis; roughly half of these metastases are symptomatic and the other half are detected by imaging. Predictors of poor prognosis include poor performance status, older age, and being male. The pathologic subtypes of the disease (small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma) all carry a similarly poor prognosis. Current guidelines of the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend the use of positron emission tomography (PET), CT scanning, or fused PET/CT scanning of the chest, liver, adrenals, bone, and other areas of concern in the diagnosis and staging of SCLC (NCCN guideline-SCLC 2017). Thoracic radiotherapy has also become important for improving OS among patients with SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. In one prospectively randomized study of 498 patients with extensive-stage SCLC (WHO performance status score 0-2) who achieved complete response to chemotherapy, patients who received consolidation thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) had significantly better 2-year OS rates than did those who did not receive thoracic radiotherapy (13% vs. 3%, P=0.004). Thoracic radiotherapy further improved thoracic-only failure rates (19.8% vs. 46% without, P=0.001) (Slotman B et al, Lancet Oncol 2015;385:36- 42). However, many patients with extensive-stage SCLC do not respond to the standard etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy (Fig 1). Those patients may need to receive molecular-targeted therapies or immunotherapy with the consolidating thoracic radiotherapy. Several histologic and immunohistochemical markers have been evaluated for diagnosing or monitoring treatment response in SCLC, including transcription thyroid factor-1 (positive in >85% of SCLC cases); cytokeratin 7; deletions in chromosome 3; Leu-7; chromogranin A; synaptophysin; myc amplification; and p53 mutations (present in ~75% of cases). Deletions in tumor-suppressor genes are also relatively common and include fragile histidine triad (FHIT) (80%); RAS effector homologue (RASSF1) (>90%); TP53 (>75%); retinoblastoma- 1 (RB1) (>90%); and retinoic acid receptor-beta (72%). However, to date no biomarkers have been validated for use in diagnosing SCLC. Moreover, mutations that are often present in non-small cell lung cancer (such as epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) are rare in SCLC. Several clinicopathologic features have been linked with worse prognosis, including poor performance status, significant weight loss, high lactate dehydrogenase levels, large numbers of metastatic sites, and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Because SCLC has the among the highest rates of somatic driver mutations, and because more than 95% of patie ts with SCLC are former or current smokers, immunotherapy seems a reasonable approach, as high mutation burdens correlate with good response to chemoradiotherapy and sensitivity to immunomodulators (Peifer M et al., Nat Genet 2012;44(10):1104-10). At MD Anderson Cancer Center, an ongoing phase I/II study of patients with extensive-stage SCLC has been proposed to the NRG as a prospective randomized study (PI J Welsh) (Fig 2). Use of thoracic radiotherapy to consolidate a site at which SCLC is quite likely to recur is reasonable, given that recurrence considerably reduces quality of their life as well as OS. In summary, in most cases SCLC presents as extensive-stage disease, for which outcomes are very poor. Consolidation with thoracic radiotherapy for patients who achieve a complete response to chemotherapy can improve 2-year OS rates. However, less toxic and more effective systemic treatment is also required to derive the greatest benefit from consolidation thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded

In central nervous system (CNS), radiation damage to normal tissues is presented, in part, as suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired cognitive functions. Mn porphyrin (MnP)-based redox active drugs have demonstrated differential effects on cancer and normal tissues in experimental animals that lead to protection of normal tissues and radio- and chemo-sensitization of cancers.

806,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia. Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.

With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively.

In this study, in order to validate nuclear data and the neutron transportation performance of the materials related to ADS, we measured the leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies using 14.8 MeV D-T neutrons. Two types of assemblies comprising A-1 (W+U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) and A-2 (U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) were both built up gradually starting with the first wall. The measured spectra were compared with those calculated using the Monte Carlo code neutron transport coed (MCNP)-4C. A comparison of the results showed that the experimental leakage neutron spectra for both A-1 or A-2 were reproduced well by the three evaluated nuclear data libraries with discrepancies of less than 15% (A-1) and 12% (A-2), except when below 3 MeV. For 2-cm and 5-cm uranium samples, the CENDL-3.1 calculations exhibited large discrepancies in the energy range of 2-8 MeV and above 13 MeV. Thus, the CENDL-3.1 library for uranium should be reevaluated, especially around this energy range.

We examined the contribution of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) to synaptic transmission from rod photoreceptor terminals. Whole-cell recording and confocal calcium imaging experiments were conducted on rods with intact synaptic terminals in a retinal slice preparation from salamander. Low concentrations of ryanodine stimulated calcium increases in rod terminals, consistent with the presence of ryanodine receptors. Application of strong depolarizing steps (-70 to -10 mV) exceeding 200 ms or longer in duration evoked a wave of calcium that spread across the synaptic terminals of voltage-clamped rods. This secondary calcium increase was blocked by high concentrations of ryanodine, indicating it was due to CICR. Ryanodine (50 microm) had no significant effect on rod calcium current (I(ca)) although it slightly diminished rod light-evoked voltage responses. Bath application of 50 microm ryanodine strongly inhibited light-evoked currents in horizontal cells. Whether applied extracellularly or delivered into the rod cell through the patch pipette, ryanodine (50 microm) also inhibited excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in horizontal cells by depolarizing steps applied to rods. Ryanodine caused a preferential reduction in the later portions of EPSCs evoked by depolarizing steps of 200 ms or longer. These results indicate that CICR enhances calcium increases in rod terminals evoked by sustained depolarization, which in turn acts to boost synaptic exocytosis from rods.",Excluded
96,"The role of tumor size in the radiosurgical management of patients with ambiguous brain metastases. OBJECTIVE: To identify a size cutoff below which it is safe to observe obscure brain lesions suspected of being metastases so that treatment of nonmetastases can be avoided. METHOD(S): Medical records from patients who underwent linear accelerator-based radiosurgery from August 1991 to October 2001 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were defined as brain metastasis tumor volume less than 5 cm<sup>3</sup> (diameter, ~2.1 cm) treated with a dose of 20 Gy or more. One hundred thirty-five patients had 153 evaluable brain metastases with follow-up imaging that met inclusion criteria. Median age was 54 years (range, 18-79 yr). Lesion primaries were non-small-cell lung (n = 39), melanoma (n = 44), renal (n = 37), breast (n = 18), colon (n = 3), sarcoma (n = 5), other (n = 5), and unknown primary (n = 2). Median tumor volume was 0.67 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 0.06-4.58 cm<sup>3</sup>). The minimum peripheral dose was 20 Gy (n = 132) or 21 to 24 Gy (n = 21). At the time of analysis, the median follow-up for all patients was 10 months (range, 0.2-99 mo). RESULT(S): The 1- and 2-year actuarial local control rates for all of the lesions were 69 and 46%, respectively. For lesions of 1 cm (0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) or less, the corresponding local control rates were 86 and 78%, respectively, which was significantly higher than the corresponding rates of 56 and 24%, respectively, for lesions larger than 1 cm (0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) (P = 0.0016).

Carbon-11 labeled diacylglycerol (<sup>11</sup>C-DAG) has been developed as a signal transduction imaging agent for the CNS, and it can visualize the second messenger. For clinical application by positron CT (PET), the <sup>11</sup>C-DAG solution must be prepared for intravenous injection. However, the <sup>11</sup>C-DAG does not dissolve in water because of its lipophilicity and requires a solubilizer such as human serum albumin (HSA) and Tween 80 (TW-80).

In the brain, uptake of <sup>11</sup>C-DAG dissolved with HSA was 1.3-1.8 times higher than that of dissolved with TW-80. On the other hand, the lung and spleen showed a higher uptake of <sup>11</sup>C-DAG using TW-80 than when using HSA. Especially, the lungs showed 20-40 times higher uptake than when using HSA. Also, the washout of radioactivity from tissue was slower, and the dose of radiation exposure was estimated to be higher, with TW-80 than with HSA. Therefore, between TW-80 and HSA with different solubilizing mechanisms, the latter was suggested to be a better solubilizer of <sup>11</sup>C-DAG.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the power frequency magnetic field of 0.6mT applied to humans has an effect on cognitive function as has been suggested by animal studies. These fields are less than the suggested intervention level in the UK of 1.6mT and are similar to those found close to some domestic appliances.METHOD AND MATERIALS: A randomized three-way cross-over design using a battery of computerized cognitive function tests were used in the presence or absence of a 50Hz or static magnetic field. Sixteen healthy volunteers undertook two training and three test sessions with a 50Hz or static 0.6 mT magnetic field from a set of coils centred on the head.RESULTS: In response to the 50 Hz field, disruptions of accuracy were seen from an attentional task (the ability to correctly recognize words shown 20min previously and the ability to maintain a string of digits in working memory). There was no similar response to comparable levels of static magnetic field.CONCLUSIONS: These tests indicated at least temporary deterioration in attention, and working and secondary memory performance while a 50 Hz field is applied. There were no adverse effects on speed from any of the tasks. It was not possible in this study to be sure if these effects were persistent.",Excluded

Follow-up was 2 years and included documentation of subjective discomforts (induration, deviation and painful erection).RESULTS: Induration (27.6%) and deviation (24.1%) of the erected penis are little improved, but in two-third of patients (65%) with painful erection defined relief could be obtained. It could also be shown that patients with short history of symptoms had best chances for a successful treatment.

Background: Pre-operative radiosurgery (SRS) preceding the resection of brain metastases promises to circumvent limitations of post-operative cavity SRS. It minimizes uncertainties regarding delineation and safety margins and could reduce dose exposure of the healthy brain (HB). Method(s): We performed a systematic treatment plan comparison on 24 patients who received post-operative radiosurgery of the resection cavity at our institution. Comparative treatment plans were calculated for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (7 x 5 Gray (Gy)) in a hypothetical pre-operative (pre-op) and two post-operative scenarios, either with (extended field, post-op-E) or without the surgical tract (involved field, post-op-I). Detailed volumetric comparison of the resulting target volumes was performed, as well as dosimetric comparison focusing on targets and the HB. Result(s): The resection cavity was significantly smaller and different in morphology from the pre-operative lesion, yielding a low Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 53% (p = 0.019). Post-op-I and post-op-E targets showed high similarity (DSC = 93%), and including the surgical tract moderately enlarged resulting median target size (18.58 ccm vs. 22.89 ccm, p < 0.001). Dosimetric analysis favored the pre-operative treatment setting since it significantly decreased relevant dose exposure of the HB (Median volume receiving 28 Gy: 6.79 vs. 10.79 for pre-op vs. post-op-E, p < 0.001). Dosimetrically, pre-operative SRS is a promising alternative to post-operative cavity irradiation that could furthermore offer practical benefits regarding delineation and treatment planning.

We established an in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay of human tumours for estimation of the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis (the dividing fraction, DF), the time for the number of nuclei to double and the radiosensitivity in terms of the micronucleus frequency, based on a concept described previously. Under certain conditions, the nuclear number doubling time (NNDT) was considered to represent the potential doubling time. Tumour specimens obtained at surgery were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and were directly cultured in the presence of cytochalasin B with or without irradiation. At various intervals, the percentage of multinucleate cells (the plateau value represented the DF), the average number of nuclei per cell and the number of micronuclei in binucleate cells were determined. DF and NNDT values were obtained in 58 of the 73 tumours investigated, and the micronucleus frequency was obtained in 54 of these 58 tumours. The DF ranged from 4.1% to 71% and the NNDT ranged from 3.1 to 83 days. A DF > or = 20% was associated with a higher recurrence rate in patients undergoing curative operation. A correlation was found between the NNDT and the time to relapse in patients with recurrent disease. The average number of micronuclei per binucleate cell at 2 Gy of irradiation (after subtraction of the value at 0 Gy) ranged from 0.052 to 0.35. Tumours which produced more micronuclei after irradiation showed a better response to radiotherapy.

350,"Altered visual function in monocarboxylate transporter 3 (Slc16a8) knockout mice. To meet the high-energy demands of photoreceptor cells, the outer retina metabolizes glucose through glycolytic and oxidative pathways, resulting in large-scale production of lactate and CO(2). Mct3, a proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, is critically positioned to facilitate transport of lactate and H(+) out of the retina and could therefore play a role in pH and ion homeostasis of the outer retina. Mct3 is preferentially expressed in the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium and forms a heteromeric complex with the accessory protein CD147. To examine the physiological role of Mct3 in the retina, we generated mice with a targeted deletion in Mct3 (slc16A8). The overall retinal histology of 4- to 36-wk-old Mct3(-/-) mice appeared normal. In the absence of Mct3, expression of CD147 was lost from the basolateral but not apical RPE. The saturated a-wave amplitude (a(max)) of the scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) was reduced by approximately twofold in Mct3(-/-) mice relative to wild-type mice. A fourfold increase in lactate in the retina suggested a decrease in outer-retinal pH. In single-cell recordings from superfused retinal slices, saturating amplitudes of single rod photocurrents (J(max)) were comparable indicating that Mct3(-/-) mouse photoreceptor cells were inherently healthy. Based on these data, we hypothesize that disruption of Mct3 leads to a potentially reversible decrease in subretinal space pH, thereby reducing the magnitude of the light suppressible photoreceptor current.",Excluded

The work was aimed at analysis and generalization of the hemodynamic data collected over 20 years from 26 cosmonauts flown 8 to 438 days aboard orbital stations Salyut 7 and Mir. The paper presents the results of ultrasonic investigations of the heart, arterial and venous peripheral vessels in different parts of human body, and measurements of leg veins capacity with the use of occlusive plethysmograpy. It was shown that in the resting condition such prime hemodynamic parameters as the pumping function of the heart and blood supply of the brain, and integral parameters, i.e. arterial pressure and heat rate, were best ""protected"" as they demonstrated stability throughout long exposure in microgravity. In the absence of gravitational stimulation, arterial resistance went down in essentially all vascular regions below the heart level; to put it differently, the anti-gravity distribution of the vascular tone was annulled gradually as unneeded in microgravity. Compared with the data about arteries, venous hemodynamics was found to be particularly sensitive considering the early advent and significance of changes. Venous return slowed down, resistance of the lower body vessels declined and capacity of the leg venous net increased. Functional testing with the lower body negative pressure revealed degradation of the gravity-dependent reactions that became more conspicuous as flight duration extended further. Cardiovascular deconditioning showed itself clearly on return to Earth's gravity by decreased g-tolerance during re-entry and orthostatic instability post flight. These investigations provided objective evidence for multifactorial genesis of orthostatic instability during space flight including blood redistribution, altered tone regulation of leg's venous and arterial vessels and hypovolemia.",Excluded

MRAC-based sCT images were retrospectively generated from Dixon MR images of 20 patients who had previously received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Bone segmentation performance and Dice similarity coefficient of the sCT conversion method were evaluated for bone volumes on CT images. Dose calculation accuracy was assessed by recalculating the CT-based EBRT plans using the sCT images as the base attenuation data. Dose comparison was done for the sCTand CT-based EBRT plans in planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR).

Introduction Due to the neurocognitive side effects of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is being used with increasing frequency. The use of SRS is expanding for patients with multiple (>4) brain metastases (BM). This study summarizes our institutional experience with single-fraction, linear-accelerator-based SRS for multiple BM. Methods and materials All patients who were treated between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, with single-fraction SRS for >=4 BM were included in this institutional review board-approved, retrospective, single-institution study. Patients were treated with linear accelerator-based image guided SRS. Results A total of 59 patients with >=4 BM were treated with single-fraction SRS. The median follow-up was 15.2 months, and the median overall survival for the entire cohort was 5.8 months. The median number of treated lesions per patient was 5 (range, 4-23). Per patient, the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc (range, 0.7-28.8 cc). The prescribed dose across all 380 BM for the 59 patients ranged from 7 to 20 Gy. The median of the mean dose to the total PTV was 19.5 Gy. Although the number of treated lesions (4-5 vs >=6) did not influence survival, better survival was noted for a total PTV <10 cc versus >=10 cc (7.1 vs 4.2 months, respectively; P =.0001). A mean dose of >=19 Gy to the entire PTV was also associated with increased survival (6.6 vs 5.0 months, respectively; P =.0172). Patients receiving a dose of >12 Gy to >=10 cc of normal brain had worse survival (5.1 vs 8.6 months, respectively; P =.0028). Conclusion In single-fraction SRS for patients with multiple BM, smaller total tumor volume, higher total dose, and lower volume of normal brain receiving >12 Gy were associated with increased survival. These data suggest that using SRS for the treatment of multiple BM is efficacious and that outcomes may be affected more by total tumor volume than by the number of lesions.

111,"Quantitative mapping of ion channel regulation by visual cycle activity in rodent photoreceptors in vivo. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that the extent of outer retina uptake of manganese, measured noninvasively with manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI), is a quantitative biomarker of photoreceptor ion channel regulation by visual cycle activity.METHODS: Four groups of animals were studied: control rats adapted to three different background light intensities, dark-adapted control mice systemically pretreated with retinylamine, and dark-adapted mice with a nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the RPE65 gene (RPE65(rd12)) with and without systemic 11-cis-retinal pretreatment. In all cases, rodents were anesthetized and studied with MEMRI 4 hours after manganese administration IP. Central retinal thickness and intraretinal ion channel regulation were measured from the MEMRI data.RESULT: No differences (P>0.05) in retinal thickness were noted within any arm of this study. In rats, manganese uptake was inversely proportional to the background light intensity in the outer retina but not in the inner retina. Specific inhibition at the level of RPE65 activity, either acutely with retinylamine or chronically in RPE65(rd12) mice, similarly reduced (P<0.05) outer retinal manganese uptake compared with that in control mice. In RPE65(rd12) mice, outer retinal manganese uptake returned to normal (P>0.05) after 11-cis retinal treatment. Inner retinal uptake was supernormal (P<0.05) in retinylamine-treated mice but normal in untreated or 11-cis treated RPE65(rd12) mice.CONCLUSIONS: The present data support measuring the extent of manganese uptake in the outer retina as an analytic noninvasive metric of visual cycle regulation of photoreceptor ion channel activity in vivo.",Excluded
1268,"A method for recording miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the central nervous system suitable for quantal analysis. Quantal analysis of transmitter release is useful in examining presynaptic mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission. However, in central neurons, the presence of multiple synapses makes it difficult to use the traditional quantal analysis, developed for the neuromuscular transmission. We developed a method to minimize these difficulties. Experiments were performed, using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique, on rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in a hippocampal slice preparation. When the stratum radiatum was stimulated, mixed current signals including, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), could be observed in CA1 pyramidal cells while slices were superfused with the normal, Na(+)-containing, medium. The mIPSCs could be blocked by bicuculline (10 microm). mEPSCs, eEPSCs and eIPSCs could not be observed when the Na(+)-containing perfusion medium was replaced by a Na(+)-free medium but reappeared when the Na(+)-containing medium was re-introduced. When a polarizing electrode was placed near the recorded neuron, while slices were superfused with the Na(+)-free medium, and depolarizing rectangular current pulses of different magnitudes were applied, the number of mIPSCs increased with increasing amount of the current. Amplitudes of the mIPSCs showed a Gaussian distribution and the coefficient of variation was small. These observations indicate that a combination of the Na(+)-free superfusing medium and local depolarizations with a polarizing electrode is useful for recording mIPSCs from a localized area of the recorded neuron and for quantal analysis.",Excluded

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Ramipril, as a mitigator of radiation-induced spinal cord injury.SETTING: Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.METHODS: Total of 22 rats were irradiated with single doses of 23.6-33 Gy at the C4-T2 spinal levels. After irradiation, the rats were randomized to the radiation only control group and the Ramipril-treated (radiation + Ramipril) experimental group. Ramipril 1.5 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water starting 1 week after radiation through the study duration.RESULTS: All the rats irradiated with 28.5-33 Gy became paralyzed at 125 +/- 4 days, whereas no rats became paralyzed after 23.6 Gy. The time to develop paralysis was delayed to 135 +/- 4 days in Ramipril-treated group (P < 0.001). H&E and LFB showed microscopic structural restoration and remyelination with Ramipril treatment. VEGF expression was increased in the irradiated spinal cord, and the number of VEGF-positive cells was significantly decreased by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical stain with Iba-1 showed increased microglial infiltration in the irradiated spinal cords. The number of Iba-1-positive microglia was significantly reduced by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Ramipril reduced the rate of paralysis even at the paralysis-inducing radiation doses. It also significantly delayed the onset of paralysis. Neuroinflammation and endothelial cell damage may be the key mediators of radiation injury.

This caused differing degrees of atrophy in different muscles, however, this atrophy was reduced in muscles held in a lengthened position. The greatest degree of wasting was observed in the unstretched soleus, a slow postural muscle, where both Type 1 and Type 2a fibers atrophied to the same degree. However, wasting of the gastrocnemius muscle was associated with a reduction in the size of the Type 2b fibers. In both slow postural and fast phasic hindlimb muscles, atrophy was brought about by a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis in conjunction with an elevation in the rate of protein degradation. When inactive muscles were passively stretched, both protein synthesis and degradation were dramatically elevated. Even periods of stretch of as little as 0.5 h.d-1 were found to significantly decrease atrophy in inactive muscles.",Excluded
2236,"Wwox-Brca1 interaction: role in DNA repair pathway choice. In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Wwox-knockout mice. Human and mouse cells deficient for Wwox also exhibit significantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deficient cells exhibited significantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox deficiency significantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent survival differences, we found that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deficient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunofluorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker function for WWOX, in which Brca1-Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufficient cells. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates DSB repair, enhancing efficiency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance.",Excluded

The majority of those patients suffer from more than one metastasis, but up to 30% to 40% present with a solitary lesion. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) extends median survival from 1 to 2 months for treatment with steroids only, to 4 to 6 months in most series. However, long-term survival (>1-2 years) is observed in up to 10% of patients with favorable prognostic factors, such as solitary lesions, good Karnofsky performance status, and absence of extracranial disease. For those patients, individually optimized treatment is worthwhile. For good-prognosis patients with controlled extracranial disease, surgery in combination with postoperative WBRT should be considered, especially when fast relief of symptoms is mandated. For surgically inaccessible solitary lesions below a size threshold of approximately 30 ccm, stereotactic radiosurgery (RS), although never compared to surgery in a randomized fashion, seems to yield comparable results and is the treatment of choice for more than one lesion in appropriately selected patients. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning the optimal treatment regimens for brain metastases remain. These mainly concern the radiation dose, need for a combination of RS and WBRT, relative timing of different treatment modalities, and maximum number of brain metastases that can reasonably be treated with RS when long-term progression-free survival is the goal. However, RS is definitely an excellent option for salvage and palliation in patients with short life expectancy, as it is simultaneously noninvasive and cost-effective, with short hospitalization times.

2055,"The discovery and development of new potential antioxidant agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Introduction: Several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases have had associations with the oxidative process and free radical damage. Consequently, in past decades, several natural and synthetic antioxidants have been assessed as therapeutic agents but have shown limitations in bioavailability, metabolic susceptibility and permeability to the blood brain barrier. Given these issues, medicinal chemists are hard at work to modify/improve the chemical structures of these antioxidants, thereby improving their efficacy. Areas covered: In this review, the authors critically analyze several biological mechanisms involved in the generation of free radicals. Additionally, they analyze free radicals' role in the generation of oxidative stress and in the progression of many NDs. Further, the authors review a collection of natural and synthetic antioxidants, their role as free radical scavengers along with their mechanisms of action and their potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Expert opinion: So far, preclinical studies on several antioxidants have shown promise for treating NDs, despite their limitations. The authors do highlight the lack of the adequate animal models for preclinical assessment and this does hinder further progression into clinical trials. Further studies are necessary to fully investigate the potential of these antioxidants as ND therapeutic options. Â© Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

Background and purpose: High-dose fractionated radiotherapy is often necessary to achieve long-term tumor control in several types of tumors involving or within close proximity to the brain. There is limited data to guide on optimal constraints to the adjacent nontarget brain. This investigation explored the significance of the three-dimensional (3D) dose distribution of passive scattering proton therapy to the brain with other clinicopathological factors on the development of symptomatic radiation necrosis. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with head and neck, skull base, or intracranial tumors who underwent proton therapy (minimum prescription dose of 59.4 Gy(RBE)) with collateral moderate to high dose radiation exposure to the nontarget brain were retrospectively reviewed. A mixture cure model with respect to necrosis-free survival was used to derive estimates for the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model while adjusting for potential confounding factors. Result(s): Of 179 identified patients, 83 patients had intracranial tumors and 96 patients had primary extracranial tumors. The optimal dose measure obtained to describe the occurrence of radiation necrosis was the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) with parameter a = 9. The best-fit parameters of logistic NTCP models revealed D<inf>50</inf> = 57.7 Gy for intracranial tumors, D<inf>50</inf> = 39.5 Gy for extracranial tumors, and gamma<inf>50</inf> = 2.5 for both tumor locations.

One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.",Excluded
2295,"Abciximab (ReoPro) Dosing Strategy for the Management of Acute Intraprocedural Thromboembolic Complications during Pipeline Flow Diversion Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms. Background: Flow diversion with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) is an effective neuro-endovascular method and increasingly accepted for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Acute in situ thrombosis is a known complication of PED procedures. There is limited experience in the flow diversion literature on the use of abciximab (ReoPro) for the management of acute thrombus formation in PED cases. Method(s): Data were collected retrospectively on patients who received intra-arterial (IA) ReoPro with or without subsequent intravenous (IV) infusion during PED flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Result(s): A total of 30 cases in patients with a mean age of 56.7 years (range 36-84) and a mean aneurysm size of 8.6 mm (range 2-25) were identified to have intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. IA ReoPro was administered in all cases, with 20 cases receiving increments of 5-mg boluses and 10 cases receiving a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing). Complete or partial recanalization was achieved in 100% of the cases. IV ReoPro infusion at 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 h was administered postprocedurally in 22 cases with a residual thrombus. Postprocedurally, 18 patients were transitioned from clopidogrel (Plavix) to prasugrel (Effient). The majority of the cases (23/30; 77%) were discharged home. Periprocedural intracranial hemorrhage was noted in 2 cases (7%) and radiographic infarct was noted in 4 cases (13%), with an overall mortality of 0% at the time of initial discharge. Clinical follow-up was available for 28/30 patients. The average duration of follow-up was 11.7 months, at which time 23/28 (82%) of the patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0. Conclusion(s): IA ReoPro administration is an effective and safe rescue strategy for the management of acute intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. Using a dosing strategy of either 5-mg increments or a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing) can provide high rates of recanalization with low rates of hemorrhagic complications and long-term morbidity.

3287,"Relationship between acoustic pressure used for BBB disruption and amount of MRI contrast agent delivered to the brain. Objectives: The acoustic intensity needs to be very well known to efficiently open the Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) since it is mainly ruled by the mechanical index [1]. Previous studies have shown that a narrow range of peak negative pressure (PNP) is acceptable, corresponding to sufficient stable cavitation of injected microbubbles without reaching inertial cavitation responsible for irreversible damages. Within this range, only few data are available about how the pressure affects the strength of BBB disruption that is to say the amount of delivered drugs. We propose two new methods to evidence the opening threshold in vivo and measure this relationship after a MRI controlled protocol of the BBB opening: 1) Several different pressures are used at several brain locations during the same BBB opening session 2) A single point focal opening is performed and the brain uptake of contrast agent is correlated in each voxel with the pressure estimated from a MR-acoustic radiation force image [2]. Methods We use our previously introduced motorized MR-compatible FUS sys-tem [3] (Image Guided Therapy, France). An 8 channel annular array transducer operating at 1.5MHz (Imasonic, France) was calibrated in a water tank and acoustic transmission factors through rat skulls were measured in another study. This ability to shrewdly control the pressure we deliver in vivo in the brain is crucial for the two proposed methods. Fisher F344 rats (n=5, body weight=220g) were shaved and installed in the MRI bed of a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker) under isoflurane anesthesia. The transducer was coupled to the head with echographic gel. In a first experiment, after intravenous injection of microbubbles (Sonovue), a square trajectory was played with the transducer continuously shooting. 4 different pressures (0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 MPa) were applied on the 4 sides of the square. The transducer was moving at 10 mm/s, the size of the square was 5 mm and the trajectory was played 60 times. Then a 200muL Gadolinium based MRI contrast agent (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was intravenously injected, at different time after the opening (10 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours), and its uptake into the brain was quantitatively measured thank to T<inf>1</inf> maps. In a second experiment, the BBB was focally open with 0.6 MPa peak negative pressure at focus. Before the opening session, an Acoustic Radiation Force Image was acquired in order to estimate in vivo the pressure applied in each voxel during the BBB opening. After the opening, Dotarem was intravenously injected and the contrast agent concentration was measured in each voxel by acquiring T<inf>1</inf> maps [4]. The concentration in each voxel is then correlated to the pressure which has been used in this voxel to open the BBB. Results The first experiment with the square trajectory gives a rough estimation of the pressure threshold. Indeed it appears clearly (see Fig. 130) that the BBB is not open on the 0.25 and 0.35 MPa sides while it is open on the 0.45 and 0.55 MPa sides. The acoustic threshold must be between 0.35 and 0.45 MPa. With the second injection, we also found that the BBB was already close as soon as 4 hours after the opening even for the 0.55 MPa region. The second experiment gives a more accurate estimation of the pressure threshold. By plotting the concentrations in contrast agent in the voxel versus the pressure used in these voxel to open the BBB (see Fig. 131), two trends are observables. In a first pressure range, from 0 to 0.4 MPa, the pressure is not sufficient to open the BBB so the concentration is not significant. In a higher pressure range, from 0.4 MPa to 0.6MPa, the pressure is sufficient to open the BBB and the concentration increases as the pressure increases in a roughly linear way. With this experiment the found pressure threshold is about 0.4 MPa. A third way of determining the opening threshold is to study the width of the opening on the sides [LB1] of the square of the first ex-periment. Indeed it is possible to plot the concentration profile across the lines of the opening and t compare it to the Gaussian profile of the pressure which has been studied in water tank. It appeared that the width where the BBB is open matches with the width on the Gaussian profile where the pressure is higher than 0.4 MPa. Conclusions The two different methods proposed for the study of the dependency of drug uptake after BBB disruption with acoustic pressure give consistent results. We find an acoustic pressure threshold for the BBB opening of 0.4 MPa, for a 1.5 MHz working frequency. This result is in good accordance with the literature [5]. By acquiring T2 weighted images after those experiments, we are confident we caused no damages up to 0.6 MPa. This pressure is close to the one for which adverse effects started to appear in our previous studies thought. As a consequence, the pressure window for a safe and efficient BBB opening is quite narrow which highlights that the pressure in vivo has to be very well controlled. [LB1] Above the opening threshold, the relationship between drug uptake and acoustic pressure is linear. The knowledge of this relationship is key in order to predict drug pharmacokinetics after BBB disruption.",Excluded

337,"Effects of optimization of injection dose on image quality and radiation exposure dose in FDG PET tests. Objectives: The injection dose affects the image quality and radiation exposure dose in 1 8F-FDG PET tests. In this study, we optimized injection dose by adjusting it by patient's body weight and examined the effects of this optimization on image quality and exposure dose in FDG PET tests by analyzing a large number of actual patients' data using newly developed dose management software that complies with international standards. Method(s): The data of 1,771 patients were retrospectively analyzed using the dose management software, ontiTM (RYUKYU-ISG, Kyoto, Japan). The injection dose was fixed to 240 MBq for 846 patients and that was adjusted to 3.7 MBq/kg-body weight for 925 patients. Image quality was evaluated by noise equivalent countdensity (NECdensity) calculated excluding the counts of brain and bladder. Exposure dose was obtained using the rate of 0.019 mSv/MBq based on the report in ICRP publication 106. NECdensity and radiation exposure dose of the fixed and adjusted groups of patients were compared. Result(s): The optimization of injection dose changed the injection dose, NECdensity and radiation exposure dose from 239.9 +/- 6.83 MBq, 0.39 +/- 0.1 and 4.56 mSv to 213.0 +/- 39.9 MBq, 0.42 +/- 0.2 and 4.04 mSv, respectively. The adjustment of injection dose by body weight statistically significantly improved of image quality evaluated using NECdensity and radiation exposure dose by 8% and 11%, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): By analyzing a large number of patients' data using ontiTM, we demonstrated that the optimization of injection dose could contribute to the improvement of image quality and radiation exposure dose in 1 8F-FDG PET tests.",Excluded
1161,"Multicomponent T<inf>2</inf> relaxometry reveals early myelin white matter changes induced by proton radiation treatment. Purpose: To investigate MRI myelin water imaging (MWI) by multicomponent T<inf>2</inf> relaxometry as a quantitative imaging biomarker for brain radiation-induced changes and to compare it with DTI. Method(s): Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T<inf>2</inf> compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED. Conclusion(s): MWI might detect early white matter radiation-induced alterations, providing additional information to DTI, which might improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the radiation damage.

3346,"The role of edema in diffuse sclerosis and other leukoencephalopathies. The pathologic changes associated with broad zones of demyelination of the cerebral white matter, the diffuse sclerosis group, are analyzed with respect to the contribution of cerebral edema to their pathogenesis. The characteristics of cerebral edema in general are reviewed, and the interpretation offered that only one type of cerebral edema, that characterized by an extracellular accumulation of fluid, occurs in man. In the diffuse sclerosis group, edema is most readily recognized by the tendency for the arcuate zone of white matter to be spared when the deeper white matter is severely degenerated. Edema is demonstrated in metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, disorders of amino acid metabolism, trauma, hypertensive disease, radiation effect, diffuse hypoxia with acidosis, and other conditions, i.e., both in disorders of myelin metabolism and in conditions in which normal myelin is injured by extrinsic influences. These groups cannot be consistently distinguished morphologically, in part because the injury by edema often obscures any primary morphologic change which may have been present. A familial tendency does not necessarily denote a metabolic abnormality specifically related to the chemistry of a myelin constituent, since the lesions might result from edema induced by some other type of familial process. Such familial processes might be metabolic, but are not specifically related to myelin formation or catabolism, as might be true of diseases like phenylketonuria or maple syrup urine disease. Edema may also occur in instances in which a familial disease induces diffuse hypoxia and acidosis, as exemplified by two instances of severe white matter degeneration in subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy; one of these is an additional instance of apparent 'crib death' by this cause.",Excluded
1909,"Neuroradiographic changes following convection-enhanced delivery of the recombinant cytotoxin interleukin 13-PE38QQR for recurrent malignant glioma. OBJECT: Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a novel method for delivering therapeutic agents to infiltrative brain tumor cells. For agents administered by CED, changes on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging directly resulting from catheter placement, infusion, and the therapeutic compound may confound any interpretation of tumor progression. As part of an ongoing multiinstitutional Phase I study, 14 patients with recurrent malignant glioma underwent CED of interleukin (IL) 13-PE38QQR, a recombinant cytotoxin consisting of human IL-13 conjugated with a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. Serial neuroradiographic changes were assessed in this cohort of patients. METHOD(S): Patients were treated in two groups: Group 1 patients received IL13-PE38QQR before and after tumor resection; Group 2 patients received infusion only after tumor resection. Preoperative and postinfusion MR images were obtained prospectively at specified regular intervals. Changes were noted along catheter tracks on postresection MR images obtained in all patients. A simple grading system was developed to describe these changes. When MR imaging changes appeared to be related to IL1 3-PE38QQR, patients were followed up without instituting new antitumor therapy. CONCLUSION(S): As CED of therapeutic agents becomes more common, clinicians and investigators must become aware of associated neuroimaging changes that should be incorporated into toxicity assessment. We have developed a simple grading system to facilitate communication about these changes among investigators. Biological imaging modalities that could possibly distinguish these changes from recurrent tumor should be evaluated. In this study the authors demonstrate the challenges in determining efficacy when surrogate end points such as time to tumor progression as defined by new or progressive contrast enhancement on MR imaging are used with this treatment modality.",Excluded

Background: We performed a dose-escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with standard concurrent and sequential-dose temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Method(s): Histologically proven glioblastoma patients underwent IMRT dose escalation. IMRT was delivered over 5 weeks with the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique to the two planning target volumes (PTVs) defined by adding 5-mm margin to the respective clinical target volumes (CTVs). CTV1 was the tumor bed plus the enhancing lesion with 10-mm margin; CTV2 was the area of perifocal edema with 20-mm margin. Only the PTV1 dose was escalated (planned dose escalation: 60, 62.5, 65, 67.5, 70 Gy) while the PTV2 dose remained the same (45 Gy). Result(s): Forty consecutive glioblastoma patients were treated. While no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was recorded during the dose escalation up to 67.5/2.7 Gy, two out of the first six consecutively enrolled patients on the highest dose level (70/2.8 Gy) experienced a DLT, and therefore a cohort expansion was required. 3/14 patients experienced a DLT on the highest planned dose level, and therefore the MTD was not exceeded. After a median follow-up time of 25 months no grade >2 late neurological toxicity was recorded. Conclusion(s): By using a SIB IMRT technique, a radiation dose of 70 Gy in 25 fractions (biological effective dose - BED - of 92.8 Gy) can be delivered with concurrent and sequential standard dose TMZ, without unacceptable acute toxicity in patients with glioblastoma.

1056,"Monte Carlo-based dose reconstruction in a rat model for scattered ionizing radiation investigations. PURPOSE: In radiation biology, rats are often irradiated, but the precise dose distributions are often lacking, particularly in areas that receive scatter radiation. We used a non-dedicated set of resources to calculate detailed dose distributions, including doses to peripheral organs well outside of the primary field, in common rat exposure settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed dose reconstruction in a rat through an analog to the conventional human treatment planning process. The process consisted of: (i) Characterizing source properties of an X-ray irradiator system, (ii) acquiring a computed tomography (CT) scan of a rat model, and (iii) using a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine to generate the dose distribution within the rat model. We considered cranial and liver irradiation scenarios where the rest of the body was protected by a lead shield. Organs of interest were the brain, liver and gonads. The study also included paired scenarios where the dose to adjacent, shielded rats was determined as a potential control for analysis of bystander effects.RESULTS: We established the precise doses and dose distributions delivered to the peripheral organs in single and paired rats. Mean doses to non-targeted organs in irradiated rats ranged from 0.03-0.1% of the reference platform dose. Mean doses to the adjacent rat peripheral organs were consistent to within 10% those of the directly irradiated rat.CONCLUSIONS: This work provided details of dose distributions in rat models under common irradiation conditions and established an effective scenario for delivering only scattered radiation consistent with that in a directly irradiated rat.",Excluded
3161,"Cumulative genetic damage in hematopoietic stem cells in a patient with a 40-year exposure to alpha particles emitted by thorium dioxide. Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of the long-lived radionuclide, thorium-232, was widely used as a radiographic contrast medium for several decades. Due to the poor excretion of the sol, however, Thorotrast would deposit in the liver, bone marrow and other tissue, and patients would receive alpha-particle irradiation for life. To gauge the cumulative genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells due to chronic exposure to alpha particles, we conducted a multi-end-point evaluation in a 72-year-old man who had been administered a 32-ml bolus of Thorotrast during cerebral angiography performed over 40 years ago in 1950. Peripheral T lymphocytes were cultured to quantify the frequencies and cellular distributions of asymmetrical and symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations in first-division metaphases and micronuclei in cytokinesis-arrested interphase II cells. Aberrations were scored using classical chromosome group analysis methods and chromosome painting techniques. Assays of glycophorin-A (GPA) mutations in red blood cells were also performed to obtain a relative measurement of damage sustained by the erythroid stem cell population. Results revealed that approximately 30% of the lymphocytes in this patient contained one or more chromosome aberrations, the majority of which were of the ""stable"" type. About one-third of the lymphocytes with chromosome damage carried multiple aberrations, suggesting that significant numbers of stem cells survive exposures to alpha-particle radiation that induce complex genomic alterations. Increased frequencies of GPA mutations were observed, demonstrating that genomic damage is also induced in erythroid progenitors. The numbers of micronuclei in lymphocytes were only moderately increased compared to expected values for persons of comparable age, and thus this end point was not useful for quantifying exposure level. Despite the relatively severe burden of somatic cell damage induced by 40 years of internal alpha-particle irradiation, the patient remains surprisingly free of any serious illness.",Excluded

641,"Complete homonymous hemianopia due to cerebral infarction of the lateral geniculate body: A case report with diffusion tensor image findings. Background: The human lateral geniculate body (LGB) is the thalamic visual center linking the retina to the striate cortex. The human LGB has dual blood supplies from the anterior choroidal artery of the internal carotid artery and the lateral posterior choroidal artery of the posterior cerebral artery. Thus, complete homonemous hemianopia caused by cerebral infarction of the LGB is extremely rare. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented due to a sudden visual field defect. He had no other vascular risk factors or focal neurological deficits. Five days later, complete right homonymous hemianopia was detected by Humphrey automated perimetry. Brain MRI and DWI revealed an infarction at the left LGB. MRA revealed no obstruction or stenosis. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) showed decreased fractional anisotrophy value in the left occipital subcortical area (right, 0.436; left, 0.384). The density of optic radiation decreased more on the right side in tractography than on the left side. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Quadruple sectoranopia can be caused by lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the LGB which are supplied by the anterior choroidal artery. The lateral posterior choroidal artery supplies the central part of the LGB. Thus, occlusion of this artery produces a wedge-shaped homonymous hemianopsia or horizontal sectoranopia. However, despite the LGB lesion, our patient showed a complete homonemous hemianopia probably due to involvement of the whole LGB through occlusion of a variant vessel that supplied the whole LGB rather than simultaneous occlusion of 2 vessels. The patient's DTI findings were well consistent with his clinical features.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate disease pattern, patient characteristics, and survival in patients treated for brain metastases from renal cell carcinoma.METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all patients with brain metastases from renal cell carcinoma treated between 1983 and 2009 in northern Norway.RESULTS: The time interval between first cancer diagnosis and brain metastases was dependent on initial TNM stage (median 42 months in stage II vs. 10 months in both stage III and stage IV). Only few patients did not harbor extracranial metastases. Systemic therapy after diagnosis of brain metastases has been used in only three patients. Surgical resection and/or radiosurgery have been administered in 34% of patients, but whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone remained the cornerstone. Median survival was 4.1 months (3.7 months in the WBRT alone group, 10.1 months in the surgery and/or radiosurgery group). Two factors were significantly associated with better survival: solitary brain metastasis and age <=64 years. The prognostic impact of the recursive partitioning analysis classes was not confirmed, while the new graded prognostic assessment index performed better.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection and/or radiosurgery contribute to prolonged survival. As most patients harbor extracranial metastases that threaten their lives, systemic treatment theoretically might play a role in the management of these patients, but more data need to be collected to confirm the clinical impact of immunotherapy, angiogenesis inhibition, and other signal transduction inhibitor approaches.",Excluded
3607,"Effective techniques for reduction of radiation dosage to patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures. The goal of this study was to improve radiation dose reduction techniques in invasive cardiology and after patients' radiation data had approached minimal levels, to evaluate predictors of their radiation exposure resulting from invasive cardiac procedures. Over the course of 1 year (and 1996 procedures) we minimized cinegraphic frames and runs, as well as fluoroscopy time, and trained ourselves to achieve effective fluoroscopy-saving positioning of blinds and filters toward the regions of interest. We were consequently able to reduce the mean dose-area products (DAP) for coronary angiography and angioplasty, combined interventions, high-frequency rotational atherectomy, and excimer laser angioplasty: from levels of 53.9 Gy cm(2), 79.6 Gy cm(2), 112.3 Gy cm(2), 119.4 Gy cm(2), and 168.0 Gy cm(2) as currently reported in the literature, to 12.9 Gy cm(2), 13.3 Gy cm(2), 25.9 Gy cm(2), 33.0 Gy cm(2), and 27.1 Gy cm(2), respectively. The mean DAP due to interventions in acute myocardial infarction was 38.3 Gy cm(2). DAP was influenced by body mass index, complexity of coronary artery disease, tube angulation, documented structure, coronary recanalization, emergency circumstances, and the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) target vessel involved, but not by stent implantation. By favouring radiation-reducing cranial posteroanterior views over standard left anterior oblique views for visualization of the left anterior descending and the diagonal artery, we consequently achieved mean PTCA-DAPs of 10.4 Gy cm(2) and 8.6 Gy cm(2), respectively: levels significantly lower than those for PTCA of the right coronary artery (13.3 Gy cm(2)), left circumflex artery (13.7 Gy cm(2)), and obtuse marginal branch (16.9 Gy cm(2)).

2139,"Biopsy of enlarging lesions after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases frequently reveals radiation necrosis. Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers excellent local control for brain metastases (BM) with low rates of toxicity. Radiation necrosis (RN) may occur after treatment and is challenging to distinguish from local recurrence (LR). We evaluated enlarging brain lesions following SRS that were subsequently biopsied to differentiate RN versus LR.Methods: This study reviewed patients receiving SRS for BM between 2008 and 2012 who underwent a biopsy for suspicion of RN versus LR on MRI. Data collection included demographics, radiation parameters, imaging findings, and post-biopsy pathology. Kaplan-Meier methods determined overall survival. Fisher's exact test assessed for association between lesion biopsy result and variables of interest.Results: Thirty-four patients with 35 biopsied BM were included. Lesions were biopsied a median of 8.8 months after SRS. Most patients had primary lung cancer (11; 31.4%). Eleven (31.4%) biopsies were positive for LR and 24 (68.6%) showed RN only. Median overall survival was longer for patients with RN (31.0 mo) than for patients with LR (14.5 mo; P = 0.135). Time from SRS to biopsy was significantly different between RN and LR groups; 10 lesions (52.5%) biopsied <=9 months after SRS showed LR, whereas 1 lesion (6.3%) biopsied >9 months after SRS showed LR (P = 0.004).

1905,"Role of immediate-release morphine (MIR) in the treatment of predictable pain in radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is crucial in the management of cancer patients in both the curative and palliative settings. However, patients often report pain both during positioning for, and execution of, radiotherapy and this may be a reason for interrupting the radiotherapy session. This observation is common even if the patient is undergoing baseline drug therapy for cancer pain. Recent data suggest that orally administrated immediate-release morphine (MIR) is able to reduce pain in patients with predictable pain. The authors tested a rescue dose of MIR 10 or 20 mg, 20 to 60 minutes before radiotherapy, to verify the effectiveness of MIR in this setting and also to assess the patient's ability to receive the full course of radiotherapy. One hundred forty consecutive patients were evaluated during radiotherapy treatment and visual analogue scale (VAS) and positioning VAS scores were assessed. All patients completed the course of scheduled radiotherapy and pain was well controlled, despite the fact that previous pharmacological treatment had not been able to completely control chronic cancer pain. These data strongly suggest a role for MIR pretreatment in patients with pain due to positioning during radiotherapy.",Excluded

The hypnotic effect of hexobarbital, measured in male NMRI-mice, was reduced during the first 24 hours after a unique or fractionated whole-body X-ray irradiation with 700 and 1400 R resp. 70 to 280 R and twelve hours after a unique intravenous injection of 16,0 mg tretamine per kilogram of body weight. Immediately after a unique injection of a high dose of tretamine and 24 hours after the last of four applications of 0,25 to 2,0 mg/kg which were repeated each after one day, the sleeping time after hexobarbital was prolonged. 24 hours after fractionated injection of tretamine (0,5 mg/kg each time), the concentration of hexobarbital in the brain showed a significant increase compared with the control animals. These results show that the decreased effect of hexobarbital in the early post-irradiation phase is based on pharmacodynamic processes while the increase of the effect produced by continued administration of tretamine can be explained by pharmaco-cinetic reasons.",Excluded

2360,"MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Neuroendocrine surveillance and management of neurosurgical patients. Advances in the management of traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracranial tumours have led to improved survival rates and an increased focus on quality of life of survivors. Endocrine sequelae of the acute brain insult and subsequent neurosurgery, peri-operative fluid administration and/or cranial irradiation are now well described. Unrecognised acute hypopituitarism, particularly ACTH/cortisol deficiency and diabetes insipidus, can be life threatening. Although hypopituitarism may be transient, up to 30% of survivors of TBI have chronic hypopituitarism, which can diminish quality of life and hamper rehabilitation. Patients who survive SAH may also develop hypopituitarism, though it is less common than after TBI. The growth hormone axis is most frequently affected. There is also accumulating evidence that survivors of intracranial malignancy, who have required cranial irradiation, may develop hypopituitarism. The time course of the development of hormone deficits is varied, and predictors of pituitary dysfunction are unreliable. Furthermore, diagnosis of GH and ACTH deficiency require dynamic testing that can be resource intensive. Thus the surveillance and management of neuroendocrine dysfunction in neurosurgical patients poses significant logistic challenges to endocrine services. However, diagnosis and management of pituitary dysfunction can be rewarding. Appropriate hormone replacement can improve quality of life, prevent complications such as muscle atrophy, infection and osteoporosis and improve engagement with physiotherapy and rehabilitation.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Robotic stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy (SRT) become an important modality in the treatment of cranial meningiomas. In this study, we analysed the treatment parameters and outcomes of our cranial meningioma patients treated with SRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 103 cranial meningioma lesions of 93 patients were treated with CyberKnife (Accurayw) Stereotactic Radiosurgery Unit. 42 patients (45%) received SRT as primary modality, and 51 patients ( 55 %) received postoperatively. Six patients have treated with external beam radiotherapy. Of the 103 cases, 69 of the lesions were located basally, 34 of them nonbasally. The most common symptoms in patients with basal tumours (38 patients, 58%) was detoriation in the visual field and the restriction of the eye movements and in patients with non-basal tumours (8 patients, 26%) was headache. In 33 patients (32%) tumours were located just adjacent to the optic apparatus or brain stem, 27 of them (26%) were located close (<1cm) to the optic apparatus or brain stem. SRT dose and fractionation were determined according to tumor localization. Optical apparatus and brainstem maximum point dose constraints for one fraction were 10 Gy and 14 Gy; 25 Gy and 30 Gy were for 5 fractions. RESULT(S): The median age was 44 (16-81). The female to male ratio was 73/20 (3.6/1). Median follow-up was 10 months (1-37 months). The median dose was 2500cGy (1500 - 3000 cGy). The median number of fraction was5 (1-5 fractions) fraction.GTVvolume ranged between 0.66cm3and 80.6 cm3 (Median 12.4 cm3). Median conformity index was 1.4 (1.06 to 2.03) and the median homogeneity index was 1.25 (1.09 to 1.56). Among the patients with follow up, local control rate was 98%. Only one patient with parasagittal meningioma underwent decompressive surgery due to radiation induced edema. All other side effects were either grade I or II. The most common side effect was headache associated with brain edema in 10 patients (11%).

PURPOSE: Despite aggressive treatment with radiation therapy plus concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ), the prognosis for glioblastoma remain poor. We investigated the potential of targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in glioblastoma. METHODS ANDMATERIALS: We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation by in vitro clonogenic assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251, U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. RESULT(S): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect ofTMZ in U251 glioblastoma cell line which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression and in vitro. Increased radiosensitizing effects ofTMZwere associated with the induction of apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with fractionated radiation and TMZ with a trend toward improved survival rates. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections showed that Cpd188 decreased the expression of CD31 (a marker of endothelial proliferation), vascular endothelial growth factor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, suggesting that Cpd188 also has anti-angiogenic effects. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell line which was originated from a patient who had a glioblastoma and also was confirmed high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT. CONCLUSION(S): These data indicate that Cpd188 has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in human glioblastoma, especially in patients whose tumor has a high level of STAT3 expression regardless of MGMT methylation status.",Excluded
3515,"Quantitative analysis of calcium-dependent vesicle recruitment and its functional role at the calyx of Held synapse. Recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. It has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. An elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([Ca2+]i) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. However, the precise relationship between [Ca2+]i and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. To probe the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (AP)-like stimuli, we monitored [Ca2+]i and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of Held synapse. We found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [Ca2+]i, without any apparent cooperativity. The slope factor for this increase is approximately 1 pool/(microM x s). Blocking Ca2+-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state EPSCs during 100 Hz AP-like trains were maintained through this Ca2+-dependent recruitment mechanism. Using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [Ca2+]i. We could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5-15 AP-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of EPSC depression.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Cervical pedicle screws are advantageous in their biomechanical stability within cervical and cervicothoracic constructs. The seventh cervical vertebra contains relatively large pedicles and has a low incidence of vertebral artery localization within the transverse foramina. The freehand technique of pedicle screw insertion is advantageous in decreasing intraoperative radiation exposure both to the patient and surgeon. In this study, we investigated the safety and accuracy of C7 pedicle screw placement at our institution utilizing an anatomic freehand technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed, and 20 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria over a five-year period (2013-2018). The C7 pedicle screw placement capability and accuracy were recorded. Accuracy was graded based upon postoperative imaging on a Grade 0-3 scale for breach assessment. Any neurologic complications related to screw placement were also recorded.RESULTS: Successful pedicle screw placement occurred in 90% of attempts (36/40). The overall screw accuracy rate was 89% (32/36). There were four minor breaches (Grade 1) identified on CT, without neurologic complications. The fusion rate in our cohort for patients with follow up greater than eight months was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: In our patient series, the freehand technique of C7 pedicle screw placement utilizing a small laminotomy with direct pedicle palpation appears to be a safe and accurate method for screw placement, and provides adequate biomechanical stability for cervical and cervicothoracic construct fusion.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To report the level of effectiveness and safety, in our experience, of CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) robotic radiosurgery as a first-line treatment against pharmacologically refractory trigeminal neuralgia.METHODS: We treated 33 patients with the frameless CyberKnife system as a monotherapy. The retrogasserian portion of the trigeminal nerve (a length of 4 mm, 2-3 mm anterior to the root entry zone) was targeted. Doses of 55 to 75 Gy were prescribed to the 100% isodose line, according to a dose escalation protocol. The patients were evaluated for the level of pain control, time to pain relief, hypesthesia, and time to pain recurrence.RESULTS: The median age was 74 years. All but 2 patients (94%) achieved a successful treatment outcome. The follow-up period was 9 to 37 months (mean, 23 months). The Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity Scale (BPS) score before radiosurgery was III in 2 patients (6%), IV in 8 patients (24%), and V in 23 patients (70%). The time to pain relief was 1 to 180 days (median, 30 days). No facial numbness was observed. Only 1 patient developed a transitory dysesthesia of the tongue. After treatment, the BPS score was I, II, or III in 31 patients (97%). Pain recurred in 33% (11 patients) at a mean of 9 months (range, 1-43 months). Three patients with recurrences had low pain control by medication (BPS score, IV), and 1 patient (BPS score, V) needed a radiofrequency lesioning (BPS score, I at 12 months).CONCLUSION: CyberKnife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia allows pain relief at safe doses and is suggested for pharmacologically refractory trigeminal neuralgia.

1652,"Changes in the vestibular function during space flight. An analysis of observations and investigations carried out in space flight has shown that some cosmonauts and astronauts have experienced vestibular disorders during the transition to weightlessness. Vestibular-sensory disorders include: Spatial illusions (the feelings of falling down, being in an upside-down position, the sensations of rotation of the craft or the body) and vertigo occurring during the onset of the orbital flight and head movements; Feelings, similar to those experienced in response to Coriolis accelerations on the Earth, which occasionally develop in weightlessness during the spacecraft rotation upon abrupt head and body movements and restrained feet; Feelings ""of the load on the vestibular analyser which is unlike any Earth-bound effects"" upon abrupt head movements during the first hours of an orbital flight and ""a prolonged movement"" during the switch-off of thrusters in weightlessness. Vestibular-vegetative disorders comprise a complex of symptoms similar to those of motion sickness: loss of appetite, stomach awareness (12%), hypersalination, nausea (9.6%) and vomiting (4.8%). Soviet studies suggest that the vestibular tolerance to the flight effects depends on the natural stability and training to the cumulative effect of adequate vestibular stimuli. This has been used in the development of the system of vestibular selection. Changes in the vestibular function seem to play the major role in the development of motion sickness in weightlessness, extra-labyrinthine factors being contributory. The current hypotheses have not yet been adequately confirmed in experiments. A detailed physiological analysis allows the conclusion that the decisive factor in the development of motion sickness may be the disturbance of the function of analysers responsible for spatial orientation which take the form of sensory conflicts as well as an altered reactivity of the organism due to the hemodynamic rearrangement.

854,"Radiation necrosis or glioma recurrence: is computer-assisted stereotactic biopsy useful?. Fifty-one patients with supratentorial glioma treated with external beam radiotherapy (median dose 59.5 Gy) who then demonstrated clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression underwent stereotactic biopsy to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis. The original tumor histological type was diffuse or fibrillary astrocytoma in 21 patients (41%), oligodendroglioma in 13 (26%), and oligoastrocytoma in 17 (33%); 40 tumors (78%) were low-grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). The median time to suspected disease progression was 28 months. Stereotactic biopsy showed tumor recurrence in 30 patients (59%), radiation necrosis in three (6%), and a mixture of both in 17 (33%); one patient (2%) had a parenchymal radiation-induced chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The tumor type at stereotactic biopsy was similar to the original tumor type and was astrocytoma in 24 patients (47%), oligodendroglioma in eight (16%), oligoastrocytoma in 16 (31%), unclassifiable in two (4%), and chondroblastic osteosarcoma in one patient (2%). At biopsy, however, only 19 tumors (37%) were low grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). Subsequent surgery confirmed the stereotactic biopsy histological findings in eight patients. Follow-up examination showed 14 patients alive with a median survival of 1 year for the entire group. Median survival times after biopsy were 0.83 year for patients with tumor recurrence and 1.86 years for patients with both tumor recurrence and radionecrosis; these findings were significantly different (p = 0.008, log-rank test). No patient with radiation necrosis alone died. Other factors associated with reduced survival were a high proportion of residual tumor (p = 0.024), a low proportion of radionecrosis (p < 0.001), and a Kernohan Grade of 3 or 4 (p = 0.005). In conclusion, in patients with previously irradiated supratentorial gliomas in whom radionecrosis or tumor recurrence was clinically or radiographically suspected, results of stereotactic biopsy could be used to differentiate tumor recurrence, radiation necrosis, a mixture of both lesions, or radiation-induced neoplasm. In addition, biopsy results could predict survival rates.",Excluded

2753,"Reverberation challenges the temporal representation of the pitch of complex sounds. Accurate neural coding of the pitch of complex sounds is an essential part of auditory scene analysis; differences in pitch help segregate concurrent sounds, while similarities in pitch can help group sounds from a common source. In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Dejerine and Benson and Geschwind postulated disconnection of the dominant angular gyrus from both visual association cortices as the basis for pure alexia, emphasizing disruption of white matter tracts in the dominant temporooccipital region. Recently functional imaging studies provide evidence for direct participation of basal temporal and occipital cortices in the cognitive process of reading. The exact location and function of these areas remain a matter of debate.OBJECTIVE: To confirm the participation of the basal temporal region in reading.METHOD: Extraoperative electrical stimulation of the dominant hemisphere was performed in three subjects using subdural electrodes, as part of presurgical evaluation for refractory epilepsy.RESULTS: Pure alexia was reproduced during cortical stimulation of the dominant posterior fusiform and inferior temporal gyri in all three patients. Stimulation resulted in selective reading difficulty with intact auditory comprehension and writing. Reading difficulty involved sentences and words with intact letter by letter reading. Picture naming difficulties were also noted at some electrodes. This region is located posterior to and contiguous with the basal temporal language area (BTLA) where stimulation resulted in global language dysfunction in visual and auditory realms. The location corresponded with the visual word form area described on functional MRI.CONCLUSION: These observations support the existence of a visual language area in the dominant fusiform and occipitotemporal gyri, contiguous with basal temporal language area. A portion of visual language area was exclusively involved in lexical processing while the other part of this region processed both lexical and nonlexical symbols.",Excluded

Coincident hand and foot movements are more reliably performed in the same direction than in opposite directions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess motor cortex function, we examined the physiological basis of these movements across three novel experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that upper limb corticomotor excitability changed in a way that facilitated isodirectional movements of the hand and foot, during phasic and isometric muscle activation conditions. Experiment 2 demonstrated that motor cortex inhibition was modified with active, but not passive, foot movement in a manner that facilitated hand movement in the direction of foot movement. Together, these findings demonstrate that the coupling between motor representations within motor cortex is activity dependent. Because there are no known connections between hand and foot areas within primary motor cortex, experiment 3 used a dual-coil paired-pulse TMS protocol to examine functional connectivity between secondary and primary motor areas during active ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and supplementary motor area (SMA) conditioning, but not ventral premotor cortex (PMv) conditioning, produced distinct phases of task-dependent modulation of excitability of forearm representations within primary motor cortex (M1). Networks involving PMd-M1 facilitate isodirectional movements of hand and foot, whereas networks involving SMA-M1 facilitate corticomotor pathways nonspecifically, which may help to stabilize posture during interlimb coordination.

For intracranial lesions, however, early evidence suggests that focal radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy may achieve high local control rates and limit radiation toxicity. This study examines the efficacy of treatment approaches in the management of CNS germinoma patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Methods. Seventy-nine patients who received primary treatment for germinoma between 1980 and 2010 at UCSF were identified and their charts reviewed. Primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results. 29 patients were treated with XRT alone and 50 with XRT and chemotherapy. 22 patients received focal XRT, 32 received whole brain irradiation (WBI) and 9 received CSI. Field data was unrecoverable for 16 patients. 14 patients progressed and 8 died from disease. PFS rate at 5 years was 87.7% and OS rate at 5 years was 93.0%. Overall, focal XRT had significantly higher rates of disease progression compared to WBI or CSI (p - 0.047 and p - 0.008 respectively) and among patients who had solitary lesions, focal XRT and chemotherapy had significantly higher rates of disease progression (p - 0 .024) than WBI and chemotherapy.

However, the apparent target size of the ""cocaine binding site,"" as measured with the cocaine analogue 2 beta-[3H]carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane in the same assays, was approximately 140 kDa. Radiation inactivation of the binding of other ligands (GBR-12935 and mazindol) led to target size estimates in the same range (94 kDa and 133 kDa, respectively). All of these target sizes are significantly larger than the estimate of 70 kDa derived from the deduced amino acid sequence for the cloned dopamine reuptake transporter cDNA. Larger target sizes than expected have also been reported for ligand binding to the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and glucose transporter. The estimated sizes for the ligand binding site(s) associated with the dopamine transporter protein are difficult to reconcile with a single transporter protein of 70 kDa.

2755,"The Role of Advanced Imaging in Assessing Response to Definitive Chemoradiation Before Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We examined the responses to chemoradiation according to imaging modality in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Provided patients achieved at least a partial response, advanced imaging response neither affected survival nor added information to the decision to offer prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), suggesting that limited-stage SCLC patients with partial response using any imaging modality should not be denied PCI. Introduction: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) improves survival for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Evidence for PCI in limited-stage SCLC largely derives from studies requiring only chest x-ray (CXR) to determine remission status. We analyzed thoracic chemoradiation therapy (TCRT) outcomes according to imaging modality to determine which patients benefitted most from PCI. Patients and Methods: All limited-stage SCLC patients who received TCRT as well as PCI at our institution were reviewed. Imaging between TCRT end and PCI start was characterized as complete (CR), partial (PR), or other response. Result(s): Thirty-eight consecutive patients were assessed for TCRT response before PCI with CXR (n = 21), chest computed tomography (CT; n = 27), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 11). CR was identified on 71% of CXRs, 41% of CT scans, and 18% of PET/CT scans. Median survival was 28.3 months for the entire cohort and did not differ for patients who had CXR alone versus CT and/or PET/CT for restaging (P =.78) or those with PR using any modality versus CR using all modalities (22.6 months vs. 45.5 months; P =.22). CT CR patients had numerical but not statistically significant improved 2-year (P =.18) and 3-year (P =.13) survival compared with CT PR. Conclusion(s): CXR remains an appropriate modality to assess TCRT response before PCI in limited-stage SCLC. Advanced imaging did not inform the decision to offer PCI in this study. Because of similar excellent survival profiles independent of imaging modality and TCRT response, this analysis suggests limited-stage SCLC patients with PR using any modality should not be denied PCI, akin to standards for extensive-stage SCLC.

The purpose of this study was to discuss the optimal management of patients with clival chordomas and provide an up-to-date review of the field. Methods. A schematic description of the anatomy of the clivus and its surrounding structures is provided based on the modular classification of the surgical corridors used in endoscopic skull base surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) techniques are described. Results. The optimal treatment is gross total resection. Recent advances in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery have allowed very high rates of macroscopic and radiographic complete tumor resection in spite of the challenging location of these lesions. When the tumor location or extension is too lateral or inferior to be effectively resected with an endoscopic approach, an open approach or a combination of endoscopic and open approaches in stages should be considered. Postoperative RT is usually indicated because the likelihood of recurrence is high in spite of complete surgical resection. The main site of recurrence is local and late recurrences are relatively common. The probability of cure is approximately 50% at 10 years and significantly increases when complete tumor resection has been achieved. Conclusion. The preferred treatment for patients with clival chordoma is gross total resection (via endoscopic endonasal surgery when possible) followed by postoperative RT. Treatment at experienced multidisciplinary cranial base centers is key to minimize complications and to enhance the probability of total removal of the tumors.

2917,"Modulation of hypersensitivity to oxidative DNA damage in ATM defective cells induced by potassium bromate by inhibition of the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein is a pivotal multifunctional protein kinase predominantly involved in DNA damage response, as well as in maintaining overall functional integrity of the cells. Apart from playing its major role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage, ATM, when mutated, can additionally determine oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In the present paper we aim to investigate the levels of oxidative stress potentially induced by the oxidizing rodent renal carcinogen KBrO<inf>3</inf> in ATM-defective lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from four classical AT patients (with different ATM mutations), one AT variant with reduced hypersensitivity to X rays, obligate AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control. A possible modulatory involvement of PARP in potentially induced oxidative stress is also evaluated following its inhibition with 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB). Treatments with KBrO<inf>3</inf> clearly showed a marked hypersensitivity of the ATM-defective LCLs, including the AT variant. A marked and statistically significant reduction of KBrO<inf>3</inf>-induced chromosomal damage following inhibition of PARP by 3-AB, was observed in all AT LCLs, but not in those from the AT variant, AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control. This result is suggestive of a modulatory involvement of PARP in the hypersensitivity of ATM-defective cells to DNA oxidative damage. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
76,"Environmental toxicology: Sensitive periods of development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Development of the mammalian central nervous system is a complex process whose disruption may have severe and long-lasting consequences upon brain structure and function, potentially resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Many NDDs are known to be genetic in origin, with symptom onset and their underlying mechanisms now known to be regulated during time-dependent windows or 'critical periods' during normal brain development. However, it is increasingly evident that similar disturbances to the developing nervous system may be caused by exposure to non-genetic, environmental factors. Strikingly, at least 200 industrially applied or produced chemicals have been associated with neurotoxicity in humans and exposure to these modifying compounds, through consumer products or environmental pollution, therefore poses serious threats to public health. Through a combination of human epidemiological and animal experimental studies, we identified developmental periods for increased vulnerability to environmentally-modifying compounds and determined whether and how exposure during specific sensitive time-windows could increase the risk for the NDDs of autism, ADHD or schizophrenia in the developing organism. We report that many environmental toxicants have distinct sensitive time-windows during which exposure may disrupt critical developmental events, thereby increasing the risk of developing NDDs. The majority of these time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. We propose four underlying mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, altered neurotransmission and thyroid hormone disruption. Given the complexity of underlying mechanisms and their prenatal inception, treatment options are currently limited. Thus, we conclude that preventing early exposure to environmental toxicants, by increasing public awareness and improving government and industry guidelines, may ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of NDDs.

3431,"Effect of He-Ne laser radiation on the monoamine in mouse brain. Background: It is known that monoamine may take part in the regulation of various functional activities of the body and also in the pathophysiological processes, but the reports about the influnences of low-power laser radiation over monoamine are still rare. Moreover, the results gained are very inconsistent, and some are even contradictory to each other. Objective(s): To elucidate whether low power He-Ne laser radiation can affects serotonin(5-HT) and dopamine(DA) in brain. Design(s): A completely randomlized study based on the experimental. Setting and Materials: The experiment was done in the Central Laboratory of the First Hospital of Beijing University. Materials used were 90 Kunming male mice with body-weight 20-27 g, supplied by Beijing University Animal Centre. Intervention(s): The mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups with randomized arithmetic form. They are normal control group, sham radiation group, aser irradiation group A(13.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), aser irradiation group B (27.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) and laser irradiation group C(55.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The cranial bone and brain of the mouse was exposed under mild anesthesia and irradiated on the sinciput with different doses of He-Ne laser. Then the mice were killed by decapitation. Living creature samples were made. Main Outcome Measure(s): The cerebral serotonin and dopamine were observed and measured by means of high performance liguid chromatography-electrochemistry (HPLC-EC). Result(s): Dopamine contents (ng/g) were 485.4 +/- 10.1 in laser group A, 505.8 +/- 10.3 in laser group B and 524.1 +/- 10.5 in laser group C, with significant difference as compared with that of the sham laser group( 446.5 +/- 7.1) (P < 0.05, F = 4.64; P < 0.01, F = 8.63; P < 0.01, F = 14.52, respectively). Serotonin contents (ng/g) were 1 283.8 +/- 25.1 in laser group A, 1 337.0 +/- 26.8 in laser group B and 1429.9 +/- 30.1 in laser group C, significantly higher than that of the sham laser group(1 198.0 +/- 28.5) (P < 0.05, F = 4.92; P < 0.01, F = 9.75; P < 0.01, F = 16.83, respectively). It was found that there was a significant increase in the cerebral serotonin and dopamine in the irradiated mice, and within the laser dose range used, the larger is the laser dose was, the more DA and 5-HT are. Conclusion(s): He-Ne laser radiation may cause a significant increase in 5-HT and DA in the brain of the mice, and the increase is related to the dose of laser radiation.",Excluded

666,"Radiation-induced trismus in the ARTSCAN head and neck trial. UNLABELLED: Trismus, a well-known sequelae after treatment of head and neck cancer, decreases a patient's oral function and quality of life. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) investigate the long-term prevalence of radiation-induced trismus in patients treated for head and neck cancer according to two different fractionation schedules; and 2) model a dose-response relationship for trismus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Swedish ARTSCAN trial, a prospective randomised multicentre study comparing conventional and accelerated fractionation. A total of 124 patients agreed to a clinical ENT examination 21-127 months (median 66 months) after beginning radiation therapy. Trismus-related scores were assessed using the EORTC H&N35 Quality of Life questionnaire. The TheraBite( R) range of motion scale was used to measure maximal interincisal distance. The dose-response relationship for structures important for mastication and the temporomandibular joints was investigated by normal tissue complication probability modelling.RESULTS: No significant differences in patient-reported trismus or maximal interincisal distance were found between the two trial arms. Patient-reported moderate to high scores regarding trismus increased from 3% at the start of radiation therapy to 25% at the long-term follow-up. Maximal interincisal distance correlated significantly with patient-reported scores of trismus. The best dose-response fit to the endpoint data was found for the dose to the ipsilateral masseter.CONCLUSIONS: Trismus is a persistent complication after radiotherapy with 3D-conformal radiation therapy. We found no difference between the severity and prevalence of trismus between conventional and accelerated fractionation, but a significant correlation between the absorbed dose to the mastication structures and opening of the mouth. Further prospective studies may determine whether a reduced dose to structures important for mastication using intensity-modulated radiation therapy will reduce problems with trismus.",Excluded
319,"Primary hypoparathyroidism: A new endocrine immune related adverse event (irAEs) secondary to combination treatment with PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. Context: The advent of checkpoint inhibitors has dramatically impacted the clinical course of multiple malignancies, but these drugs can also result in aberrant immune activation leading to undesirable offtarget inflammation and autoimmunity. Although several endocrine irAEs following administration of anti PD-1 and CTLA-4 agents have been observed, parathyroid involvement has not yet been reported. Case Description: A 73yo male was diagnosed with melanoma for which he underwent surgical excision but a year later developed diffuse metastatic disease involving soft tissue sites, bone, and liver. Combination immunotherapy with Nivolumab (anti PD-1 antibody) and Ipilimumab (anti CTLA-4 antibody) was initiated. Patient underwent two cycles of therapy, but shortly thereafter developed fatigue and bilateral extremity paresthesia. He reported to ED due to progressive symptoms including ataxia requiring use of wheelchair, slow speech, and perioral tingling. On exam, he displayed normal orientation, ataxia, and negative Chvostek/Trousseau sign. Laboratories revealed: total calcium markedly low (5mg/dl, 8.4- 10.2mg/dl), albumin normal (4.1g/dL, 3.5-4.7g/dL), ionized calcium decreased (0.67mMol/L, 1.13- 1.32mMol/L), magnesium low (1.5mg/dL, 1.8-2.9mg/dL), high phosphorous (6.6mg/dL, 2.5-4.5mg/dL), undetectable iPTH (<1.0pg/mL, 9-80pg/mL), decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D (18ng/mL, 30-100ng/mL), normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (29pg/mL, 18-64pg/mL), FeCa 0.017, and negative PTH antibody. Evaluation of calcium sensing receptor antibodies was unavailable clinically, but pursued in research setting (pending). Laboratories a week prior to presentation were normal. He had no history of neck radiation and imaging showed no parathyroid infiltrative process. He was admitted with diagnosis of autoimmune primary hypoparathyroidism and started on calcium gluconate drip in addition to oral calcium carbonate, calcitriol, ergocalciferol, and magnesium supplementation. Close laboratory monitoring and aggressive repletion were pursued. He experienced significant improvement in symptoms that correlated with calcium correction. His parathyroid function has not recovered since diagnosis. Other irAEs have included: thyroiditis, hepatitis, dermatitis, and possible neuropathy. IrAEs have been medically managed, and he has shown great response to ongoing therapy. Conclusion(s): Temporal proximity of hypoparathyroidism to initiation of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab without other mechanism for acute injury points towards immunotherapy as the most likely cause of primary hypoparathyroidism. The underlying etiology is likely nonspecific immune activation, but presence of CaSR antibodies is being evaluated. This case highlights the need to further understand the mechanism of irAEs and increase clinical vigilance to detect early signs and symptoms of endocrine irAEs.",Excluded
1784,"Subcutaneous or topical administration of 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> protects from radiation-induced alopecia in mice. Alopecia, a common sequel of radiation treatment of brain tumors, increases patient stress to the extent that refusal of treatment may occur. The expectation that loss of hair will be prevented, or that regrowth will occur, is extremely important to patients. To investigate prostaglandin- induced radiation protection against alopecia, the hair of B6D2F<inf>1</inf> male mice was plucked from the right thigh and surrounding area to induce anagen. Fourteen days later, mice were injected subcutaneously in the neck with 10 mug 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> in 0.2 ml of vehicle, or with the vehicle alone. In another group of previously plucked mice, 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> in the same concentration, or the vehicle was applied topically. One hour later, graded single doses from 6.5 to 12.5 Gy <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma irradiation were given to groups of six animals. On day 21 post-plucking, all animals were killed and a portion of the irradiated site was excised. The average hair counts per field in irradiated animals were 85 +/- 4 (6.5 Gy), 25 +/- 5 (8.5 Gy), and 5.5 +/- 0.7 (10 Gy). Animals receiving the prostaglandin systemically had values of 60 +/- 10 (6.5 Gy), 54 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 66 +/- 6 (10 Gy), and 30.1 +/- 8 (12.5 Gy). Topical application of the prostaglandin resulted in protection that yielded 52 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 34 +/- 4 (10 Gy), and 3.2 +/- 0.9 (12.5 Gy) hairs per field. Both systemic and topical application of 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> protected from some degree of radiation-induced alopecia, which supports the conclusion that prostaglandins may be useful in the protection of hair follicles in patients treated with radiation for brain tumors.",Excluded

Introduction Bone metastases one of the most common presentation of various malignancies and typically associated with a short-term prognosis in cancer patients. These patients primarily visit the clinics with complain of pain with poor quality of life and functional disability. Methods To analyze the demographics, treatment profile and survival of cases treated in different centers combined. A total of 500 patients with symptomatic bone metastases were studied retrospectively over the period of 4 years from 2013 to 2017. Results The median age of presentation was 50 years. The most common primary cancer associated with bonemetastasis were prostate (32%), breast (35%) and lung (30%). Almost 75% cases of bone metastasis in female patients encountered due to breast followed by cervix and lung. The predominant reason for clinical presentation was bony and/or neuropathic pain (70%), followed by pathological fracture (20%), including spinal cord compression and fracture impending associated with or without soft tissue mass (10%). Out of 410, 30% had synchronous visceral metastasis to single or multiple sites like brain, lung and liver. 90% cases received palliative radiation with multiple radiation dosing schedules, decided a per the patient's general conditions. The median survival observed was 12-60 months in prostate, 7-15 months in lung; 12-30 months in breast cancer and 20 months in thyroid.

Guidelines based on dosimetric data exist regarding tolerable doses to pacemakers. Little is known about the effects of radiation on implantable drug delivery systems (IDDS). The objective of our study is to evaluate the safety of radiation treatment delivered to patients with IDDS.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated patients who received external beam radiation therapy in our department after implantation of an IDDS between January 1, 2000 and November 30, 2011. Information was collected on IDDS function, treatment goals, treatment fields, prescribed doses, treatment energies, and cumulative radiation doses to the pump and the catheter.RESULTS: A total of 39 patients received 60 separate courses of radiation therapy, of which 12 patients received radiation with either the pump or the catheter in the field. The remaining patients received scatter radiation only. The goal of radiation was palliative in all but one of the patients. Cumulative pump doses ranged from 5 to 36 Gy, and catheter doses ranged from 15 to 45 Gy. Beam energies ranged from 6 to 18 MV photons. All devices were checked after the completion of radiotherapy with a median follow-up of 4.5 months, and all were found to be in good working condition.CONCLUSIONS: IDDS failures related to external beam radiation therapy seem to represent a rare occurrence.

OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is well established in the treatment of cranial base meningiomas. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) offers an additional treatment option. Data for radiological regression differ, ranging from 13 to 61%. Therefore, the aims of this prospective study were to quantitatively analyze tumor volume (TV) shrinkage and to calculate determining factors. METHOD(S): Eighty-four patients were examined under equal conditions before and after SRT. Fat-saturated axial T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans with 1- to 3-mm slice thickness were used. After image fusion, TV was drawn in each slice to analyze TV shrinkage three-dimensionally by the planning system. RESULT(S): Mean TV had shrunk by 33% at 24 months (P = 0.02) and by 36% at 36 months (P = 0.0007) after SRT. With regard to half-year intervals, TV reduction decreased continuously towards a steady state (P < 0.0001). Younger age (P = 0.001) and smaller TV (P = 0.01) are determining factors. There was no correlation between TV reduction, prescribed dose, histological classification, sex, or previous operations. CONCLUSION(S): Meningiomas shrink significantly after SRT. TV shrinkage declines towards a steady state, which is not yet defined. Younger age and smaller TV are determining factors. Previous operations, sex, prescribed dose, or histological subtypes do not affect TV shrinkage. Eighteen to 24 months after irradiation, when symptoms are clinically stable, is the best time for the first magnetic resonance imaging scans evaluating tumor control and shrinkage.

We show that (R)-roscovitine increases a tonic GABA-mediated current in rat hippocampal neurons. This enhanced tonic current appears independent of synaptic GABA release and requires functional transmembrane GABA transport. The effect of (R)-roscovitine is associated with neither modification of GABAA receptors nor protein kinase activity, but is associated with a significant increase in intracellular GABA concentration in hippocampal GABAergic neurons. (R)-roscovitine-induced tonic inhibition significantly suppresses spontaneous spiking activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, (R)-roscovitine is a potent modulator of neuronal activity in rat hippocampus and may provide a tool for preventing paroxysmal activity.",Excluded

Although recurrent spinal cord compression is a common problem, little is known about whether reirradiation preserves neurologic function and what risk of radiation myelopathy it carries. To investigate this question, we reviewed patients at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1992 undergoing two or more courses of radiotherapy to the same segment of the spinal column with radiographically documented epidural disease at the time of reirradiation to determine outcome as measured by the ability to walk and by survival. Fifty- four patients met the study criteria. Radiation doses for the first course ranged from 2,250 to 5,400 cGy (median, 3,000 cGy), and total dose for all courses to the reirradiated spinal segment ranged from 3,650 to 8,089 cGy (median, 5,425 cGy). All patients were ambulatory following the first course of radiation, 40 (74%) were ambulatory at the onset of reirradiation, and 42 (78%) were ambulatory at the end of reirradiation. Thirty-seven patients (69%) remained ambulatory at their last follow-up 6 days to 80 months following reirradiation (median, 4.7 months). Five patients eventually became nonambulatory 6.5 to 35 months following reirradiation. Median survival for all patients following reirradiation was 4.2 months. We conclude that for cancer patients with progressive epidural disease following radiotherapy, reirradiation frequently preserves ambulation and carries minimal risk of radiation myelopathy during the patients' lifetime.",Excluded

Background: Presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) appears to be the chief cause of drug resistance to cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapy. Experimental models suggest that these resistant cancer cells undergo dormancy transition that is best targeted with a stemness modulator in its activation window through a strategy that we call ADAPT: Activating (CSC) from Dormancy And Potentiate for Targeting. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that 5FU activates while celecoxib inhibits and depletes these putative colorectal CSC. We retrospectively administer three year ADAPT therapy in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients using capecitabine and celecoxib +/- radiation following maximal responses (complete (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)) to first-line combination chemotherapy. ADAPT therapy led to 30% CR and additional 10% surgical CR whose median survival reached 92.7 months in patients with unresectable MCRC. (Lin et al AACR 2010 LB-254).

The initial steps of pattern formation in the developing Drosophila eye involve the coordination of cell cycles, changes in cell shape, and the specification of the R8 photoreceptor cell. These events begin several cell rows ahead of the morphogenetic furrow and are positively regulated by secreted signaling proteins and the proneural HLH transcription factor atonal (ato). Two HLH regulatory proteins that function to suppress neuronal development in other tissues, extra macrochaetae (emc) and hairy (h), are expressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow. While neither h nor emc is required for photoreceptor cell determination, in emc-h-clones the morphogenetic furrow and differentiated eye field advance up to eight ommatidial rows ahead of adjacent wild-type tissue. This indicates that morphogenetic furrow progression and neuronal differentiation are negatively regulated by a combination of anteriorly expressed HLH regulatory proteins.",Excluded
1935,"Timed hypocaloric feeding and melatonin synchronize the suprachiasmatic clockwork in rats, but with opposite timing of behavioral output. Temporal organization of the molecular clockwork and behavioral output were investigated in nocturnal rats housed in constant darkness and synchronized to nonphotic cues (daily normocaloric or hypocaloric feeding and melatonin infusion) or light (light-dark cycle and daily 1-h light exposure). Clock gene (Per1, Per2 and Bmal1) and clock-controlled gene (Vasopressin) expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was assessed over 24 h. Light and exogenous melatonin synchronized the molecular clock, signaling, respectively, 'daytime' and 'nighttime', without affecting temporal organization of behavioral output (rest/activity rhythm). By contrast, synchronization to hypocaloric feeding led to a striking temporal change between gene expression in the suprachiasmatic clock and waveform of locomotor activity rhythm, rats then becoming active during the subjective day (diurnal-like temporal organization). When the time of feeding coincided with activity offset, normocaloric feeding also synchronized the locomotor activity rhythm with no apparent switch in temporal organization. Peak of Per2 expression in the piriform cortex occurred between the beginning and the middle of the activity/feeding period, depending on the synchronizer. These data demonstrate that even though the suprachiasmatic clockwork can be synchronized to nonphotic cues, hypocaloric feeding likely acts downstream from clock gene oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nuclei to yield a stable yet opposite organization of the rest/activity cycle.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly population, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau protein tangles. These events are especially prevalent in the hippocampus region which is responsible for long term memory. In this animal study, we investigated if cranial X-irradiation could reduce the formation of Ab plaques as a potential novel clinical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the rationale being that external beam radiotherapy has been used previously as an effective clinical treatment for systemic amyloidosis. Materials/Methods: A transgenic mouse model was used that expresses a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with early-onset AD. Radiation treatments were either a single dose (5 Gy, 10 Gy or 15 Gy) or daily fractionation (1 Gy, 2 Gy) to a dose of 10 Gy to a single side of the head. Brains were harvested at various times post-irradiation (2-8 wks) and coronal sections were evaluated for H&E and antibody specific immunohistochemistry to detect beta-amyloid plaques and assess radiation response, staining for IL1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, microglia cells (CD11b) and activated microglia cells (CD68). Result(s): Radiation treatments were well-tolerated. H&E stained tissue sections indicated no evidence of a significant decrease in cell density (Nissl staining) and no compelling evidence of significant cellular necrosis. No signs of devitalization, malacia or spongiosus or classic acute or chronic inflammatory features were evident. The number and size of beta-amyloid plaques were compared between the irradiated and shielded halves of the brain. The average number of plaques in the unirradiated brain increased with age, the values for 32, 34 and 38 week old animals were 43.9 (SD +/- 17.6; n = 9), 61.7 (SD +/- 19.8, n = 9) and 109 (SD +/- 26.9, n = 9) respectively. Radiation treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of plaques throughout the brain (paired t-test p = 0.002).This effect was more significant in the hippocampus region (p = 0.0004). At 4 weeks post-treatment 5, 10 and 15 Gy caused a 71 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 24%, 92 +/- 34% reduction in plaque incidence in the hippocampus. The greatest reductions were noted at longer times post-treatment. TGF-beta staining was restricted to the irradiated side of the brain, little or no site-specific staining of IL1 or TNF-alpha was seen. A trend was evident of activated microglia in the irradiated brain. Conclusion(s): We report the first experience that external beam irradiation can produce a significant reduction in beta-amyloid plaques associated with AD.",Excluded
3577,"The action of pulse-modulated GSM radiation increases regional changes in brain activity and c-Fos expression in cortical and subcortical areas in a rat model of picrotoxin-induced seizure proneness. The action of the pulse-modulated GSM radiofrequency of mobile phones has been suggested as a physical phenomenon that might have biological effects on the mammalian central nervous system. In the present study, GSM-exposed picrotoxin-pretreated rats showed differences in clinical and EEG signs, and in c-Fos expression in the brain, with respect to picrotoxin-treated rats exposed to an equivalent dose of unmodulated radiation. Neither radiation treatment caused tissue heating, so thermal effects can be ruled out. The most marked effects of GSM radiation on c-Fos expression in picrotoxin-treated rats were observed in limbic structures, olfactory cortex areas and subcortical areas, the dentate gyrus, and the central lateral nucleus of the thalamic intralaminar nucleus group. Nonpicrotoxin-treated animals exposed to unmodulated radiation showed the highest levels of neuronal c-Fos expression in cortical areas. These results suggest a specific effect of the pulse modulation of GSM radiation on brain activity of a picrotoxin-induced seizure-proneness rat model and indicate that this mobile-phone-type radiation might induce regional changes in previous preexcitability conditions of neuronal activation.",Excluded

1858,"GBM And Radiation: The Double-Edged Sword Effects Of Cannabis. Purpose/Objective(s): Recent preclinical studies show that cannabidiol (CBD) at clinically relevant doses of 5-20 uM protects normal neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) and fetal astrocytes from ionizing radiation while directly killing GBM cells. The precise mechanisms for these double-edged sword effects of CBD are unknown. The overall hypothesis of the present study is that CBD, by targeting the numerous signaling pathways (including those that are highly active in GBM), induces an imbalance between cell killing and cell survival mechanisms in cancer cells while demonstrating protective effects on the survival of normal neuronal cells. Materials/Methods: Human GBM cell lines (U87MG, T98G and TS543) and NSC were used as regular 2D or 3D spheroid/neurosphere cultures. Levels of autophagy were examined using LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and confirmed by immunofluorescence staining levels of SQSTM1/p62. Chloroquine (10-50 uM) was used as an inhibitor of autophagic flux. Apoptosis and necrosis were determined using Annexin-V-FITC plus Propidium Iodide staining. Levels of signaling proteins (active versus total) were detected using Western blot analysis and corresponding antibodies. Data were analyzed using the Standard t-test. Result(s): Blockage of autophagy in CBD-treated 3D tumor cultures upregulated radiation-induced cell death only modestly. CBD enhanced the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK1/2 and MAPK p38 signaling cascades by more than 3-fold while partially downregulated the pro-survival PI3K-AKT cascade, thereby enhancing the efficacy of radiation treatment of tumor cells. Co-treatment of CBD-targeted cells with inhibitors of pro-survival and inflammatory pathways effectively killed surviving GBM cells in both 2D and 3D cultures. In contrast, CBD, even at high doses (20 mM), did not induce apoptosis in NSC, but promoted their differentiation into young neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): Cannabidiol has both a strong apoptotic and a modest autophagic signaling pathway as shown in several GBM models. Studies to elucidate how these two contrasting pathways may be safely and optimally modulated in CBD treatment of GBM (using 3D cultures and mini-tumor models) are ongoing.

467,"Repeat stereotactic radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas. PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for acoustic neuromas, we assessed tumor control, clinical outcomes, and the risk of adverse radiation effects in patients whose tumors progressed after initial management.METHODS AND MATERIALS: During a 21-year experience at our center, 1,352 patients underwent SRS as management for their acoustic neuromas. We retrospectively identified 6 patients who underwent SRS twice for the same tumor. The median patient age was 47 years (range, 35-71 years). All patients had imaging evidence of tumor progression despite initial SRS. One patient also had incomplete surgical resection after initial SRS. All patients were deaf at the time of the second SRS. The median radiosurgery target volume at the time of the initial SRS was 0.5 cc and was 2.1 cc at the time of the second SRS. The median margin dose at the time of the initial SRS was 13 Gy and was 11 Gy at the time of the second SRS. The median interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS was 63 months (range, 25-169 months).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months after the second SRS (range, 13-71 months), tumor control or regression was achieved in all 6 patients. No patient developed symptomatic adverse radiation effects or new neurological symptoms after the second SRS.CONCLUSIONS: With this limited experience, we found that repeat SRS for a persistently enlarging acoustic neuroma can be performed safely and effectively.",Excluded
2313,"The effect of space missions on gravity-responsive torsional eye movements. Three astronauts underwent preflight, inflight, and postflight testing of spontaneous ocular torsion and of ocular counterrolling (OCR), reflexes governed by the gravity-responsive otolith organs in the inner ear. One astronaut, A, had a 30-day space mission on Euromir '94 and was examined monocularly with SensoMotoric Instruments video-oculography (VOG). The other two astronauts, B and C, were studied with a binocular VOG and flew an 180-day mission on Euromir '95. In space, spontaneous eye torsion in the upright position was found to be substantially offset from baseline Earth-based recordings in all three subjects for the duration of the flights. In addition, the binocular studies showed a marked torsional disconjugacy. On return to Earth, offset and torsional disconjugacy persisted for many days. OCR in response to 30 degrees right and left tilt was examined preflight and postflight. Compared to preflight, Astronaut A showed reduced OCR immediately postflight, which increased over the next few days. Both Astronauts B and C had increased OCR postflight, which gradually approached but did not achieve the preflight values over 13 days postflight. The adaptation of ocular torsion in space in one astronaut and not in the other two, and slow adaptation postflight, may reflect the lack of visual feed-back and the open loop nature of the otolith-ocular torsion reflex.",Excluded

The purpose of our experiments was to examine the possible influence of the hypothalamus in supporting cellular proliferation, and thus adenoma growth. Fragments from four human pituitary adenomas (three pituitary prolactinomas; one ACTH-secreting adenoma) were transplanted into the pituitary fossa of total-body irradiated, hypophysectomized rats. The rats were killed after two weeks and perfused with a mixture of formalin and India ink. Histologic examination of serial sagittal sections through the pituitary fossa and the adjacent brain showed: vascularization of the grafts from the pituitary stalk and from the scar tissue in the sphenoid bone; survival of some adenomas; and numerous mitoses in an ACTH-secreting specimen obtained from a patient who had Cushing's disease. We conclude from these experiments that as yet unidentified hypothalamus factors are essential for the growth of certain types of pituitary adenomas.",Excluded

Preclinical data have demonstrated that ionizing radiation acts synergistically with capecitabine. This report retrospectively assessed the use of capecitabine concurrently with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. From January 2003 to March 2005, five breast cancer patients with brain metastases were referred for WBRT with concurrent capecitabine. Median age was 44 years (range: 38-53). The median dose of capecitabine was 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days (day1-14). Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days, concurrently with WBRT (30 Gy, 3 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week). Median survival after starting WBRT plus capecitabine was 6.5 months (range 1-34 months). One patient achieved a complete response. Two patients achieved partial response, including one with local control lasting until most recent follow-up. One patient had stable disease. The remaining patient was not assessable for response because of early death. Most commonly reported adverse events were nausea (n = 2) and headache (n = 2), always grade 1. Other toxicities were grade 3 hand/foot syndrome (n = 1), moderate anemia requiring transfusion and dose reduction of capecitabine (n = 1), and grade 1 mucositis (n = 1).

2465,"Repeated head CT in the neurosurgical intensive care unit: feasibility of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit undergo multiple head CT scans, resulting in high cumulative radiation exposures. Our aim was to assess the acceptability of a dedicated, special-purpose sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT protocol for neurosurgical intensive care unit surveillance head CT examinations, comparing image quality with studies performed with our standard-of-care sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT and legacy filtered back-projection standard-dose CT protocols.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 54 head CT examinations: ultra-low-dose CT (n = 22), low-dose CT (n = 12), and standard-dose CT (n = 20) in 22 patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Standard-dose CT was reconstructed by using filtered back-projection on a Somatom Sensation 64 scanner. Ultra-low-dose CT and ultra-low-dose CT examinations were performed on a Siemens AS+128 scanner with commercially available sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative parameters, including image quality and dose, were evaluated.RESULTS: Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ultra-low-dose CT represented a 68% lower dose index volume compared with filtered back-projection standard-dose CT techniques in the same patients while maintaining similar quality and SNR levels. Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT offered higher image quality than filtered back-projection standard-dose CT (P < .05) with no differences in SNR at a 24% lower dose index volume. Compared with low-dose CT, ultra-low-dose CT had significantly lower SNR (P = .001) but demonstrated clinically satisfactory measures of image quality.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit, dedicated ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance head CT imaging led to a significant dose reduction while maintaining adequate image quality.",Excluded
3274,"Influence of magnetic field on brain activity during administration of caffeine. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the effect of caffeine, the world's most popular psychoactive drug, on the electric activity of the rat's brain that exposed to extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF), during 15 days. The obtained results showed that administration of caffeine in a group of rats by dose of 10 mg/kg (equivalent to human daily consumption) caused a reduction in the mean power amplitude of electroencephalogram (EEG) trace for almost all frequency bands especially alpha (8-12 Hz). It was observed that the influence of caffeine was more evident in motor cortex than in visual cortex. While the exposure of another group to ELF-MF of intensity 0.2 mT during the same period caused an enhancement in the mean power amplitude of most EEG frequency bands; this was more observed in the right hemisphere of the brain than that of the left hemisphere. The administration of caffeine while rats were exposed to ELF-MF, led, after 5 days of exposure, to a great increase in the mean power amplitude of alpha band at all places of recording electrodes. It may be concluded that caffeine administration was more effective in reducing the hazardous of ELF-MF in motor cortex than in visual cortex.",Excluded
395,"Extravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia mimicking neoplasm after radiosurgery: case report. BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Papillary endothelial hyperplasia (PEH) is a rare form of exuberant reactive endothelial proliferation that can mimic neoplasm. We report the largest series of patients with histologically confirmed intracranial extravascular PEH developing in the field of previous treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We collected the clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathological findings from 4 patients in whom intracranial extravascular PEH developed after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. In all patients, the development of an enlarging hemorrhagic mass lesion at the site of previous radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging was radiographically suspicious for neoplasm and prompted biopsy or resection. All 4 patients elected to undergo biopsy or surgical resection. Histological examination of the biopsy and resection specimens in all patients demonstrated the classic features of PEH.CONCLUSION: The interval to the development of PEH ranged from 5 months to 6 years, 10 months. Clinical follow-up was available for 3 of the 4 patients. None of these 3 patients have demonstrated evidence of recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range, 15-30 months). These patients share common radiological features, potentially allowing preoperative diagnosis and improved guidance of clinical management. These cases suggest a link between radiosurgery and the development of PEH. These findings also suggest that PEH should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients treated with radiosurgery in whom a hemorrhagic mass lesion subsequently develops at or near the site of previous treatment. We think that complete surgical excision is the best treatment for intracranial PEH.",Excluded

1625,"Influence of surface pattern and sterilisation of solvent-cast films for peripheral nerve guidance. INTRODUCTION : Damage to peripheral nerves can result in considerable morbidity and loss of function. Poly-(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/poly-(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) blend nerve guidance conduits are a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury1. The surface morphology of scaffolds is known to influence their physical properties and cell behaviour. Yet, as scaffolds progress further towards clinical trials, it is imperative that they are subjected to/and capable of withstanding approved sterilisation methods, such as gamma irradiation, without causing detrimental effects to the material physical properties and/or cell response. This study investigates how surface patterns affect PCL films and aims to assess whether PCL/PLA blend scaffolds are able to withstand gamma irradiation sufficient for medical sterilisation. METHOD(S): PCL and PCL/PLA (4:1 w/w) blend solutions were prepared using dichloromethane (3% w/v). Smooth, pitted and micro-grooved PCL films were cast and imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while tensile testing was used to quantify their mechanical properties (Instron 1122, load cell 0.010 kN). NG108-15 cells were cultured up to 14 days on the various PCL film surfaces before fluorescence and SEM imaging were performed both to confirm biocompatibility and observe cell behaviour. PCL/PLA blend films will be sterilised at 7 incremental doses of gamma radiation (15-45 kGy) (Isotron). Mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography will be utilised to evaluate any changes in material properties or structure in comparison to unirradiated control samples. RESULT(S): The mean thickness of all types of solvent-cast film was less than 100 mum. The average porosity of the pitted PCL films was 53% with 2.1+/-0.5 mum diameter pits. Smooth films were significantly stronger, with greater modulus and strain (Table 1*p<0.01). NG108-15 cells attached and proliferated on the PCL films in vitro up to 14 days. However, only on the grooved samples did cells display organisation, demonstrating alignment in the same orientation as the grooves (Fig. 1). (Table presented) Discussion & CONCLUSION(S): These findings support the use of solvent cast PCL films for fabricating nerve guides. Pits in the surface of the inner lumen are beneficial in cell growth and grooved surfaces enable the alignment of neurons. In this work all patterned surfaces had sufficient tensile strength to function as nerve conduits. PCL/PLA blended films were tested to see whether they would withstand medical-grade sterilisation. It is hypothesised that the polymer films will not be significantly affected by gamma irradiation.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology. Given the cost and radiation exposure associated with CT, imaging should be reserved for patients with significant symptoms or focal findings on neurological examination.",Excluded

In addition, the role of Ku70 in the cellular response against ionizing radiation (IR) was analysed in fibroblasts after exposure to 5 Gy IR and apoptotic indices were examined in Ku70-overexpressed fibroblasts from an ataxia telangiectasia patient and in normal fibroblasts, before and after irradiation. In contrast to cultured cells, Ku70 was not detected in some interphase cells of human tissues and was distributed heterogeneously, even in the same nucleus. Ku70 expression was strikingly low in terminally differentiated cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, glomerular capillary endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and was absent in spermatids. In spermatocytes, Ku70 was tightly integrated with chromosome filaments, unlike other somatic cells under mitosis. After exposure to IR, Ku70 expression was not increased in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts, but was significantly increased in normal fibroblasts. Most of the increased Ku70 was of soluble nuclear protein fraction. Furthermore, overexpression of Ku70 increased radiation resistance both in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts. The presented data indicate that the distribution of Ku70 in cells of human tissues is closely associated with the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, nuclear shape and the process of repair of DNA damage caused by IR.",Excluded

Mouse neuroblastoma cells, which can be induced to undergo reversible differentiation in culture, have been used as a model to investigate the effects of ultra-violet (U.V.) radiation on terminally-differentiated nerve cells.

However, normal resistance was regained if the differentiated cells were allowed to proceed to the next G1 phase of the cell-cycle before irradiation. Neuroblastoma cells in the differentiated mode are capable of carrying out soem excision repair of DNA damage, but they appear to lack a repair mechanism present in proliferating cells.",Excluded
3188,"Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening Enhances GSK-3 Inhibitor Delivery for Amyloid-Beta Plaque Reduction. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of age-related dementia. Currently, therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS is a valued approach for AD therapy. Unfortunately, the CNS penetration is greatly hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused-ultrasound (FUS) has been demonstrated to temporally open the BBB, thus promoting therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS. Recently, the BBB opening procedure was further reported to clear the deposited Abeta plaque due to microglia activation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the use of FUS-induced BBB opening to enhance GSK-3 inhibitor delivery, which would bring additive effect of Abeta plaque clearance by FUS with the reduction of Abeta plaque synthesis by GSK-3 inhibitor in an AD mice model. FUS-induced BBB opening on APPswe/PSEN1-dE9 transgenic mice was performed unilaterally, with the contralateral hemisphere serving as a reference. GSK-3 level was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and autoradiography (ARG) was also conducted to quantitatively confirm the Abeta plaque reduction. Results from IHC showed GSK-3 inhibitor effectively reduced GSK-3 activity up to 61.3% with the addition of FUS-BBB opening and confirming the proposed therapeutic route. ARG also showed significant Abeta-plaque reduction up to 31.5%. This study reveals the therapeutic potentials of ultrasound to AD treatment, and may provide a useful strategy for neurodegenerative disease treatment.",Excluded
2694,"Anatomically consistent CNN-based segmentation of organs-at-risk in cranial radiotherapy. Planning of radiotherapy involves accurate segmentation of a large number of organs at risk (OAR), i.e., organs for which irradiation doses should be minimized to avoid important side effects of the therapy. We propose a deep learning method for segmentation of OAR inside the head, from magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Our system performs segmentation of eight structures: eye, lens, optic nerve, optic chiasm, pituitary gland, hippocampus, brainstem, and brain. We propose an efficient algorithm to train neural networks for an end-to-end segmentation of multiple and nonexclusive classes, addressing problems related to computational costs and missing ground truth segmentations for a subset of classes. We enforce anatomical consistency of the result in a postprocessing step. In particular, we introduce a graph-based algorithm for segmentation of the optic nerves, enforcing the connectivity between the eyes and the optic chiasm. We report cross-validated quantitative results on a database of 44 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs with provided segmentations of the considered OAR, which were originally used for radiotherapy planning. In addition, the segmentations produced by our model on an independent test set of 50 MRIs were evaluated by an experienced radiotherapist in order to qualitatively assess their accuracy. The mean distances between produced segmentations and the ground truth ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 mm across different organs.

Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC was first proposed in 1973 and is recommended for patients demonstrating good response to initial therapy. The general pattern of care amongst radiation oncologists in Germany has not been previously evaluated.We conceptualized and conducted this survey to assess patterns of care. Method(s): We surveyed radiation oncology institutions in Germany via an online questionnaire sent by e-mail to member institutions of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO e.V.). The questions were based on respondent and treatment characteristics with emphasis on prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited- and extensive-stage SCLC. Result(s):We receivedatotal of95responses (29%response rate). Of which 64were completed and returned and hence eligible for evaluation. Sixty-one percent of respondents were between the ages of 50-59, 88%with over 15 years of experience in the management of lungmalignancies. Sixtysevenpercent of the institutions stage theirpatients initially with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Of the 64 responses, 97% recommended deliveryofPCI in therapy responders with LS-SCLC compared to 67% with ES-SCLC. Interestingly, a quarter of respondents offered hippocampal-avoidance PCI with only 38% following their patients with serial brain imaging followingPCI.Neuropsychological testingwas generally not routinely performed.

2774,"Safety of 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a well-characterized hemoglobinopathy affecting more than 20 million individuals worldwide and carries an increased risk of cerebral vasculopathy, cerebral infarct, and stroke. As mechanisms of cerebral infarction in SCD are partly attributable to microvascular vaso-occlusive crises, manifesting as altered cerebral blood flow and associated impaired oxygen delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that can quickly provide a comprehensive perspective on structural and functional disease status, without exogenous contrast administration or ionizing radiation, have emerged as crucial clinical tools for surveillance. However, early ex vivo MRI work in suspended erythrocytes containing hemoglobin S at 0.35 Tesla (T) suggested that sickled erythrocytes can orient preferentially in the presence of an external magnetic field, and as such, it was suggested that MRI exams in sickle cell hemoglobinopathy could induce vaso-occlusion. While this observation has generally not impacted clinical imaging in individuals with SCD, it has led to resistance for some sickle cell studies within the engineering community among some imaging scientists as this early observation has never been rigorously shown to be unconcerning. Here, we performed MRI at the clinical field strength of 3 T in 172 patients with SCD, which included standard anatomical and angiographic assessments together with gold standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; spatial resolution = 1.8 x 1.8 x 4 mm; b-value = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) for acute infarct assessment (performed approximately 20 min after patient introduction to the field isocenter). The presence of vasculopathy, as well as chronic and acute infarcts, was evaluated by two independent board-certified radiologists using standard clinical criteria. In these patients (52.3% female; mean age = 19.6 years; age range = 6-44 years), hematocrit (mean = 25.8%; range = 15-36%), hemoglobin phenotype (87.8% HbSS variant), presence of silent infarct (44.2%), and overt chronic infarct (13.4%) were consistent with a typical SCD population; however, no participants exhibited evidence of acute infarction. These findings are consistent with 3 T MRI not inducing acute infarction or vaso-occlusion in individuals with SCD and suggest that earlier low-field ex vivo work of erythrocytes in suspension is not a sufficient cause to discourage MRI scans in patients with SCD.",Excluded

The physician's role may include informing the patient of the diagnosis, helping with decisions about treatment, providing psychological support, treating intercurrent disease, continuing patient-appropriate preventive care, and recognizing and managing or comanaging complications of cancer and cancer therapies. Adverse effects of therapy and cancer-related symptoms include nausea, febrile neutropenia, pain, fatigue, depression, and emotional distress. 5-Hydroxytryptamine antagonists are effective in controlling acute nausea associated with chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia requires systematic evaluation and early empiric antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Cancer-related pain, depression, and fatigue often are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Use of brief screening tools for assessing fatigue and emotional distress can improve management of these symptoms. Exercise prescription, activity management, and psychosocial interventions are useful in treating cancer-related fatigue.

1558,"Biological effect of an alternating electric field on cell proliferation and synergistic antimitotic effect in combination with ionizing radiation. Alternating electric fields at an intermediate frequency (100~300 kHz), referred to as tumour-treating fields (TTF), are believed to interrupt the process of mitosis via apoptosis and to act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Although the existence of an antimitotic effect of TTF is widely known, the proposed apoptotic mechanism of TTF on cell function and the efficacy of TTF are controversial issues among medical experts. To resolve these controversial issues, a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of TTF on cell function and the differences between the effects of TTF alone and in combination with other treatment techniques is essential. Here, we report experimental evidence of TTF-induced apoptosis and the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). For these experiments, two human Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87) were treated either with TTF alone or with TTF followed by ionizing radiation (IR). Cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were quantified after the application of TTF, and their percentages were markedly increased when TTF was combined with IR. Our experimental results also suggested that TTF combined with IR synergistically suppressed both cell migration and invasion, based on the inhibition of MMP-9 and vimentin.",Excluded
2211,"Type 5 phosphodiesterase regulates glioblastoma multiforme aggressiveness and clinical outcome. Expression of type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5), a cGMP-specific hydrolytic enzyme, is frequently altered in human cancer, but its specific role in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Herein, by analyzing a cohort of 69 patients affected by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who underwent chemo- and radiotherapy after surgical resection of the tumor, we found that PDE5 was strongly expressed in cancer cells in about 50% of the patients. Retrospective analysis indicated that high PDE5 expression in GBM cells significantly correlated with longer overall survival of patients. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous PDE5 by short hairpin lentiviral transduction (sh-PDE5) in the T98G GBM cell line induced activation of an invasive phenotype. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 activity strongly enhanced cell motility and invasiveness in T98G cells. This invasive phenotype was accompanied by increased secretion of metallo-proteinase 2 (MMP-2) and activation of protein kinase G (PKG). Moreover, PDE5 silencing markedly enhanced DNA damage repair and cell survival following irradiation. The enhanced radio-resistance of sh-PDE5 GBM cells was mediated by an increase of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of cellular proteins and could be counteracted by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Conversely, PDE5 overexpression in PDE5-negative U87G cells significantly reduced MMP-2 secretion, inhibited their invasive potential and interfered with DNA damage repair and cell survival following irradiation. These studies identify PDE5 as a favorable prognostic marker for GBM, which negatively affects cell invasiveness and survival to ionizing radiation. Moreover, our work highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting PKG and/or PARP activity in this currently incurable subset of brain cancers.",Excluded

218,"Prospective evaluation of relationships between radiotherapy dose to masticatory apparatus and trismus. AIMS: This feasibility study aimed to identify relationships between radiation doses to the masticatory apparatus as a combined block or as individual subunits with changes in trismus following radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients from a single center were recruited prospectively as part of a randomized trial comparing proactive exercises in the management of trismus. Patients with stage III/IV oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers received intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent systemic therapy. All patients had trismus prior to radiotherapy. Maximal inter-incisor distance (MID) was measured pre- and 6 months from the start of radiotherapy. Bilateral muscles of mastication: medial and lateral pterygoids (MP and LP), masseters (M), temporalis (T), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were contoured on CT images. The block comprised all muscles excluding the TMJ below the orbital floor. Mean dose, equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and V35-V60 Gy were compared with change in MID.RESULTS: In six patients, the MID deteriorated at 6 months from the start of radiotherapy compared with 14 whose MID improved. No significant association was observed between age, gender, smoking, alcohol status, exercise compliance, cisplatin, tumor site, stage, V35-V60 Gy or EUD with change in MID. A clinical outlier was excluded. Without the outlier (n = 19), a significant association was seen between mean dose and change in MID at 6 months for the ipsilateral block (p = .01), LP (p = .04) and M (p < .01). All patients where trismus deteriorated at 6 months received mean doses >40 Gy to the block.CONCLUSION: Higher mean radiation doses to the ipsilateral block, LP and M were significantly associated with deterioration in trismus. Limiting dose to these structures to <=40 Gy for tumors not invading the masticatory muscles may improve treatment-related sequelae. The ipsilateral block, LP and M should be studied further as possible alternative avoidance structures in radiotherapy treatment planning.",Excluded
2846,"Molecular architecture of a complex between an adhesion protein from the malaria parasite and intracellular adhesion molecule 1. The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to human tissues or endothelium is central to the pathology caused by the parasite during malaria. It contributes to the avoidance of parasite clearance by the spleen and to the specific pathologies of cerebral and placental malaria. The PfEMP1 family of adhesive proteins is responsible for this sequestration by mediating interactions with diverse human ligands. In addition, as the primary targets of acquired, protective immunity, the PfEMP1s are potential vaccine candidates. PfEMP1s contain large extracellular ectodomains made from CIDR (cysteine-rich interdomain regions) and DBL (Duffy-binding-like) domains and show extensive variation in sequence, size, and domain organization. Here we use biophysical methods to characterize the entire ~300-kDa ectodomain from IT4VAR13, a protein that interacts with the host receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). We show through small angle x-ray scattering that IT4VAR13 is rigid, elongated, and monomeric. We also show that it interacts with ICAM-1 through the DBLbeta domain alone, forming a 1:1 complex. These studies provide a first low resolution structural view of a PfEMP1 ectodomain in complex with its ligand. They show that it combines a modular domain arrangement consisting of individual ligand binding domains, with a defined higher order architecture that exposes the ICAM-1 binding surface to allow adhesion.",Excluded

1630,"The contribution of imaging-based treatment planning quality assurance rounds in head and neck radiotherapy planning. Purpose/Objective(s): While standard guidelines for Intensity Modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may assist in target delineation for some head and neck (HN) cancers, the complex anatomy, varying patterns of spread, frequent occurrence of unusual or advanced presentations, and risk of treatment-related toxicities from overly generous delineation render HN treatment planning (TP) very challenging. Since 2007 we have had weekly Treatment Planning Quality Assurance (TPQA) rounds with radiation oncologists and a specialized diagnostic neuroradiologist present to review TP contours for all new patients. This study quantifies the impact of this process. Materials/Methods: From 8/2010 - 2/2011, IMRT contours for 84 consecutively treated HN cancer patients were reviewed. Almost always, pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reviewed independently and fused in multiple orientations to the computed tomography TP scan using a commercial software package; thus the contours could be viewed by the group directly opposed to the MRI if desired. Pre- and post-TPQA rounds contours were saved. For this study, the pre- and post-TPQA contours were compared to record alterations in the coverage of major components (gross tumor, clinical target volume (CTV), lymph nodes, perineural invasion, or bone invasion) and the volume of change. Result(s): The tumors were mostly advanced stage (III-IV) and included various subsites: oral cavity (21%), oropharynx (19%), sinonasal (12%), skin (12%), nasopharynx (10%), salivary gland (8%), and hypopharynx (6%). Of the 84 cases, 47 (56%) were altered, including: CTV, 30/47 cases (64%); gross tumor, 25/47 cases (53%); lymph nodes, 7/47 (15%); perineural invasion, 6/47 (13%); and bone invasion, 3/47 (6%). The absolute volume change resulting from TPQA review ranged from -169.12 cc to 124.76 cc (0.03% to 636.88% of absolute pre-TPQAvolume), with a mean absolute change of 32.32 cc (39.48%) and a median change of 13.54 cc (8.96%). Volumes were equally likely to be increased (49%) or decreased (51%). The most frequently altered subsites were: hypopharynx (4/5, 80%), sinonasal (7/10, 70%), and skin (7/10, 70%). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the impact of a neuroradiology-based approach to HN TPQA. Changes were suggested to half of the cases, and the changes were equally likely to increase or decrease the target volume, suggesting a balance between tumor coverage and desire to avoid toxicity. High frequencies of changes were seen in delineation of gross tumor and CTVs because of the wide applicability of these issues, but in addition, there are specific anatomic subsites with challenging patterns of infiltrative, intracranial, or perineural spread which warrant intensive imaging-based review in collaboration with a diagnostic specialist.",Excluded

The autologous bone marrow reinjected had been taken 13 months before the transformation (8 days after the end of busulfan treatment) and frozen using a suboptimal program. Cytogenetically, the chronic phase of CML was characterized by a 46 XX Phi +/46 XX Phi - mosaic. During transformation, 3 clones were evaluated on 25 mitoses: 46 XX Phi - (7 mitoses); 46 XX Phi + (12 mitoses), and 47 XX Phi + with additional C (6 mitoses). The course of the disease after treatment was marked by: (1) disappearance of blast cells; (2) disappearance of the 47 XX Phi + population specific of transformation and of the 46 XX Phi + population. A single, normal 46 XX Phi - population remained 3 months after the bone marrow transplantation: (3) return to normal granulocyte production. However, thrombocytopenia persisted and resulted in death from cerebral haemorrhage on the 95th day. No residual blast cell infiltration was detected on post-mortem. This case shows that a massive treatment arrest acute transformation of CML. It also suggests that because busulfan had provided selective advantages or because the freezing program had been suboptimal, or both, engraftment with the 46 XX Phi -component of the initial mosaic was only partial and incomplete. Finally, it may serve as a model for the management of acute CML transformation using bone marrow autografts.",Excluded

A series of monomeric porphyrins (2-8) based on porphyrin C (1) have been tested as sensitisers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cerebral glioma using the in vitro/in vivo C6 intracerebral animal tumour model. The in vivo screening, consisting of cytotoxicity, phototoxicity (red light) and subcellular localisation studies, revealed two sensitisers (porphyrin 7, molecular weight 863 Da and porphyrin 8, molecular weight 889 Da), which had greater photoactivity than porphyrin C and similar photoactivity to haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) although at a 5-fold higher dose than HpD. Both sensitisers showed intracellular localisation to discrete organelle sites and exhibited considerably less 'dark' cytotoxicity than HpD. The kinetics of uptake of porphyrins 7 and 8 was studied in the mouse C6 glioma model as well as in biopsy samples from normal brain, liver, spleen and blood.

Purpose or Objective Radiation induced white matter injuries are feared side effects of brain irradiation that may cause cognitive dysfunction. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis is a valid tool to evaluate white matter (WM) integrity. A framework for the integrated analysis of tractographic and dosimetric data in brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy is proposed. The tool is able to simultaneously measure in specific white matter tracts the diffusion changes due to microstructural alterations and the radiation dose. Material and Methods Ten consecutive patients affected by high grade glioma were treated by conformal radiotherapy with multiple non-coplanar 6 MV photon beams from a linear accelerator with a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions of 2 Gy. Two different time-points were planned for MRI execution (before starting RT and one month after RT). Each MRI study included, beside the DTI, threedimensional T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE) before and after i.v. injection of contrast medium, as well as FLAIR and TSE-T2W images in the axial plane. The MPRAGE and the TSE-T2W images were coregistered with the b0 image and were used for the delineation of the area of parenchymal distortion (deformed area, DA). The DA included the surgical cavity and/or the area of contrast enhancement and/or the area of abnormal signal on TSE-T2W images. Deterministic fiber tracking across the whole WM was then performed using the fiber assignment continuous tracking algorithm. Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) maps were generated. A ROI-based approach was used to select the fiber tracts. All fiber tracts passing through the DA were excluded though belonging to one of the three structures considered. The fiber tracts were converted in DICOM-RT format. The MPRAGE sequences without contrast medium were used as reference images for the co-registration with the corresponding planning CT-scan. The RT structure-set files were transferred from the MRI-space into the planning CTspace using the resulting co-registration matrix. Superimposing the dose map from each patient, the dosimetric evaluation was performed. The detailed scheme of our framework is reported in Figure 1.

1176,"Primary CNS lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma, an uncommon form of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, has increased in incidence and occurs in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompetent patients is associated with unique diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic issues and the management of this malignancy is different from other forms of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Characteristic imaging features should lead to suspicion of the diagnosis, avoidance of corticosteroids (if possible) and early neurosurgical consultation for stereotactic biopsy. Since primary CNS lymphoma may involve the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and eyes, diagnostic evaluation should include assessment of all of these regions as well as screening for the possibility of occult systemic disease. Resection provides no therapeutic benefit and should be reserved for the rare patient with neurological deterioration due to brain herniation. Whole-brain radiation therapy alone is insufficient for durable tumor control and is associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity in patients over 60 years of age. Neurotoxicity is typically associated with significant cognitive, motor and autonomic dysfunction and has a negative impact on quality of life. Chemotherapy and whole-brain radiation therapy together improve tumor response rates and survival compared with whole-brain radiation therapy alone. Methotrexate-based multiagent chemotherapy without whole-brain radiation therapy is associated with similar tumor response rates and survival compared with regimens that include whole-brain radiation therapy, although controlled trials have not been performed. The risk of neurotoxicity is lower in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The incidence of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma has decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Introduction: Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies; however, no serum marker has been routinely recommended until now. Method(s): This is a prospective case control study including two groups of patients: Group Ipatients with advanced lung cancer and Group IIpatients with benign lung disease as control. Serum cytokeratin 19 (CK19) fragment levels were measured at baseline by real-time polymerase chain reaction before first-line chemotherapy. The CK19 cut-off taken was 15-cycle threshold. The primary end point was the comparison of high CK19 in cases and controls. The secondary end point was the correlation between high CK19 and progressive disease (PD), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in advanced lung cancer patients. Result(s): A total of 30 patients with advanced lung cancer (16 non-small and 14 small cell lung cancer) and 15 patients with benign lung disease were included and followed up during the period from October 2008 to October 2011 with median follow-up of one and half years. High CK19 was found in 90% of lung cancer cases as compared with 7% in controls (p < 0.001). High CK19 was found in all cases showing PD (p = 0.04).

In a 30-year-old male, multiple cerebral aneurysms developed 19 years after receiving 60 Gy of irradiation for craniophariginoma. Angiogram revealed right IC-PC and upper basilar trunk aneurysms in addition to atherosclerotic change. The right IC-PC aneurysm was wrapped and the basilar trunk aneurysm located between the origins of SCA and AICA was treated by endovascular coil embolization. The packing of the aneurysm was complete, but stenosis of the basilar artery appeared. The patient was discharged uneventfully and follow-up angiogram 6 months later demonstrated that the aneurysm had disappeared and the patency of the basilary artery had been preserved. Radiation-induced intracranial vasculopathy is a well-recognized phenomenon, but aneurysm formation is less common than arterial occlusive lesion. However, the mortality rate after bleeding is so high that immediate diagnosis and treatment by direct surgery or coil embolization are necessary.",Excluded
1224,"Translation and cross-cultural adaptation into Brazilian Portuguese of the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey version 2.0 (VHNSS 2.0) for the assessment of oral symptoms in head and neck cancer patients submitted to radiotherapy. Introduction: Patients submitted to radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer have several symptoms, predominantly oral. The Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey version 2.0 is an American tool developed to evaluate oral symptoms in head and neck cancer patients submitted to radiotherapy. Objective(s): The aim of the present study was to translate the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey version 2.0 into Brazilian Portuguese and cross-culturally adapt this tool for subsequent validation and application in Brazil. Method(s): A method used for the translation and cultural adaptation of tools, which included independent translations, synthesis of the translations, back-translations, expert committee, and pre-test, was used. The pre-test was performed with 37 head and neck cancer patients, who were divided into four groups, to assess the relevance and understanding of the assessed items. Data were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis. Result(s): The overall mean of the content validity index was 0.79 for semantic and idiomatic equivalence, and it was higher than 0.8 for cultural and conceptual equivalence. The cognitive interview showed that patients were able to paraphrase the items, and considered them relevant and easily understood. Conclusion(s): The tool was translated and cross-culturally adapted to be used in Brazil. The authors believe this translation is suited for validation.

3213,"Should irinotecan or etoposide be used in combination with carboplatin for small cell lung cancer?. Little progress has been made in the treatment of small cell lung cancer over the past two decades. Superiority of combined irinotecan-cisplatin over standard etoposide-cisplatin in a Japanese phase III trial was not confirmed in two subsequent US studies. In this Practice Point we discuss a randomized, phase III trial by Hermes and colleagues, which included 220 patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer and showed superiority of carboplatin-irinotecan versus carboplatin-oral etoposide. In this trial, 47% of patients had a performance status >=3 and 35% were older than 70 years, which represents a typical clinical practice population of patients; however, oral administration of etoposide and an arbitrary dose reduction in elderly and unfit patients represent limitations of the study. A European trial of irinotecan-carboplatin versus intravenous etoposide-carboplatin has completed accrual and results will be analyzed in 2009. Although the results of the study by Hermes et al. are of interest, substitution of etoposide by irinotecan can not be recommended.",Excluded
3327,"Shortness of breath: An unusual presentation of an uncommon malignancy. Small cell carcinomas (SCC) are rare neuroendocrine malignancies accounting for approximately 0.2% of all colorectal cancers. Since first described in 1955, approximately 200 cases of rectal SCC have been reported in the literature. The most widely accepted theory regarding development of SCC is divergent differentiation of a pluripotent stem cell precursor. Interestingly, although the gastrointestinal tract (GI) has the largest number of neuroendocrine cells, it is rare for neuroendocrine malignancies to originate there. We present a case of metastatic SCC presenting with chief complaint of dyspnea. A 50 year old female with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2 day history of dyspnea on exertion. She reported two weeks of abdominal bloating, rectal tenesmus, constipation, and unintentional weight loss. Vital signs were notable for hypertension and tachycardia. Labs were notable for alkaline phosphatase 1717 U/L, total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL, lipase 501 U/L, D-dimer 7.6 mu g/mL, WBC 23,900 mCL, Hgb 6.9 gm/dL, and MCV 64.6. CEA was 15.9. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed hepatomegaly with numerous liver lesions (largest in the right lobe measuring 9cm), enlarged intra-abdominal lymph nodes and a perirectal region mass extending to the rectosigmoid measuring 7.5x5x3cm. CT PE protocol demonstrated 2 subcentimeter lung nodules in the right middle lobe. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a mid-rectal mass extending 10cm superiorly. Biopsies revealed small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with squamous differentiation. Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin and etoposide. Small cell carcinomas of the GI tract are exceedingly uncommon. It most commonly presents in the 6th decade of life with male predominance. These tumors exhibit highly aggressive behavior and carry a poor prognosis with a median survival of 10.4 months. Immunohistochemistry differentiates SCC from other malignancies, with strongly positive synaptophysin immunoreactivity the most reliable finding. Due to its histological similarity to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and rarity, treatment guidelines are extrapolated from SCLC treatment guidelines and include platinum based chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection. Unfortunately, our patient expired 8 months later due to metastatic disease. This case underscores the importance of histological evaluation of tissue, as treatment often hinges on making an accurate diagnosis.",Excluded
3395,"Helical tomotherapy in advanced and recurrence head and neck cancer: Preliminary results. Introduction/Background/Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) by Helical Tomotherapy (HT) in patients affected by advanced and recurrence head and neck cancer. In both cases difficulties exist in treating large volumes near organs at risk (OAR) with high dose levels. Particularly, more difficulties can occur in cases of re-irradiation. HT allows this kind of treatment by using of IMRT technique with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) associated with daily IGRT. Materials and Methods/Patients and Methods: Between October 2010 and April 2011 thirteen patients (9 male and 4 female) with advanced or recurrence head and neck cancer were enrolled in our study; in particular: 3 primary cutaneous advanced carcinoma (involving orbital and/or paranasal cavities), 4 recurrences after previous radiotherapy in the same site, 7 advanced head and neck cancer. The mean age was 63.2 years. Six patients received concomitant chemotherapy platinum-based. All patients underwent fiber-optic endoscopy, CT imaging and MRI imaging for staging. All patients also underwent 18-FDG-PET-CT virtual-simulation for treatment planning. All patients received a supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol. The treatment volumes were: the gross tumor volume and positive nodes (as visible at imaging) irradiated with curative doses (66-70.5 Gy in 30 fractions, 2.2-2.35 Gy/die); nodal levels at higher risk irradiated with prophylactic doses (60 Gy/30 fractions); loco-regional nodes irradiated with prophylactic doses (54 Gy/30 fractions). The countered organ at risk were: brain, brainstem, chiasm, optic nerve, lens, spinal cord, parotid glands, mandible, temporal-mandibular joint. In patients previously irradiated the prior treatment planning was reviewed in order to evaluate the overlapping of the irradiated volumes. Results were evaluated in terms of acute and sub-acute toxicity and clinical outcome. Toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG-EORTC scale. Fiber-optic endoscopy was performed 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. CT, MRI and PET-CT imaging were performed 3 months after treatment. Result(s): All patients completed the treatment. One patient required interruption of treatment for 2 days. Five patients required infusion medical therapy, during radiotherapy, with corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-fungal, analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs and parenteral nutrition. Acute skin toxicity was: G1 in 9 patients, G2 in 2 patients, G3 in 1 patient. Acute mucous toxicity was: G1 in 8 patients, G2 in 4 patients, G3 in 1 patient. For three patients re-planning during radiation treatment was necessary because of relevant tumor volume reduction. Three patients have a complete clinical response during treatment, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Five patients have a partial clinical response > 50% at the end of RT, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Two patients have a partial clinical response < 50%, and 2 patients a stable disease after RT, confirmed at posttreatment imaging. The last patient had no sufficient follow-up to evaluate response. Late toxicity was not evaluated because of the short follow-up. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our initial experience shows that HT allows delivering of high radiation doses to the tumor volume with good precision resulting from to the ability to verify daily set-up patients by megavoltage cone beam CT. Dose escalation results in objective clinical responses already during radiation treatment with possibility of re-planning, allowing for adaptive radiotherapy. Relevant toxicity, particularly in patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy, requires close monitoring of patients and supportive care to allow completing treatment. Our supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol is useful in this regard. Our results are absolutely preliminary, PET-CT is mandatory for contouring before the treatment and during radiotherapy for re-planning and also at the of radiotherapy for quantitative response evaluation. Further follow up is necessary to evaluate long term outcome and late toxicity.",Excluded

3390,"Large cell neuro-endocrine carcinoma presenting as pancoast's syndrome. Pancoast's syndrome was first described in 1932 by Henry Pancoast as signs and symptoms of shoulder and arm pain, Horner's Syndrome, bone destruction and atrophy of hand muscles. While apical bronchial carcinoma commonly presents as Pancoast's syndrome, infection, benign tumors, and metastases should be considered. Thus, histopathological diagnosis is mandatory. Tumors of neural origin are rarely located at the thoracic inlet. We present a rare pathological tumor of Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC) presenting as typical Pancoast's Syndrome. A 70-year-old man with lifelong smoking history presented with progressive pain in his left shoulder and armpit for 6 months. His other complaints were blurry vision in the left eye, hoarse voice, weight loss and decreased appetite. Examination was significant for decreased breath sounds, left sided shoulder tenderness, ptosis, small pupil with enopthalmos, and atrophy of the hypothenar muscles and decreased sensation on the ulnar distribution of the hand and forearm with decreased motor strength and handgrip. Imaging studies revealed left apical lung mass and a mediastinal mass abutting the aortic arch with lymph node involvement. MRI of brain and spine showed involvement of subarachnoid space with left and right paravertebral masses. A biopsy of the mass revealed tumor cells positive for CK7, TTF-1, synaptophysin and chromogranin. It was negative for Napsin A, CD56, markers of squamous differentiation p63 and p40. This immunoprofile is compatible with Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma. The patient was started on radiation therapy and was scheduled for chemotherapy as an outpatient. Neuroendocrine tumors are rare and can occur anywhere in the body. Currently, LCNEC is classified a variant of large cell carcinomas; however, it is different from typical lung large-cell carcinoma in that these tumors display biological behaviors resembling those of small cell lung carcinoma and features of high-grade neuroendocrine tumors. LCNEC represent only 3% of all pulmonary malignancies. The current treatment approach, which has remained unchanged for the past 30 years, involves combination of platinum based chemotherapy and radiation, however outcome remains poor. No targeted therapy exists for these tumors because therapeutic biomarkers are incompletely known. Thus, advances in the treatment of LCNEC are needed to improve survival in patients with this class of tumors. The discovery of new, rational targeted therapies as well as preclinical models that will encompass this important subtype of lung cancer is necessary. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of Pancoast's syndrome caused by a LCNEC. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1693,"Neonatal gamma-ray irradiation impairs learning and memory of an olfactory associative task in adult rats. Adult neonatally gamma-irradiated rats were compared with control animals in a non-spatial olfactory associative task using two different procedures. Irradiation induced a clear reduction in the total mean area of the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus but not of the orbital prefrontal cortex, diagonal band and cell layers of the entorhinal and piriform cortex. The gamma-irradiation affected the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs and differentially altered the cell layers of the subfields of the ammonic fields and the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus. In the CA1 ammonic field, dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus, the cellular loss was significant in comparison with control adult rats. The behavioural data indicated that irradiated rats were deeply disturbed in learning the odour-reward association, and substantially impaired in a reversal experiment, but not in the discrimination of the odours per se. The cellular loss in the olfactory bulbs, in the CA1 and in the ventral blade of the gyrus dentatus was positively correlated with the deficit in behavioural performance. The data support the findings that the hippocampal system participates in the odour-reward associations and facilitates the long-term storage of associations after learning is achieved in this olfactory associative task.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): 107 women with invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N0-2, M0) diagnosed between 2005-2010, who underwent breastconserving surgery(BCS) as first surgery, were retrospectively selected from the Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital Breast Unit Registry. A positive resection margin was defined as a microscopic invasive or in situ tumor at the cutting edge in permanent pathologic reports. Result(s): The mean tumor size was 1.65 cm in the positive margin group and 1.68 cm in the other group(p > 0.893). 13 of 107 (12.1%) had positive margins at initial resection. Of these patients 4(30.7%)had involved caudal margin, 2 (15.3%) cranial margin, 2 (15.3%) medial margin, 2(15.3%) deep margin and 1 (7.6%) lateral margin, there were insufficient data available about the type of margin in 2 cases. 8 (61.5%) had an invasive carcinoma at the margins and in other cases carcinoma in situ was detected. 4 (30.7%) underwent additional surgery-mastectomy, to achieve negative margins. Postoperative radiation was performed for 12 (92.3%) patients. 7 (53.8%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with inadequate margins had ER positive tumors in 76.5% vs. 47.3% in other group, PR positive tumors in 46.8% vs. 52.3% in other, HER 2/neu negative tumors in 76.9% vs. 56.2% in other. Patients with a positive margins at the initial resection showed higher lobular histology rate (15.3% vs. 6.4%), incidence of multiple ipsilateral tumors (23.1% vs. 15.4%), presens of intraductal component (76.9% vs. 65.1%), but these differences between two groups were no statistically significant. 73.1% of all patients were tested for the two common founder mutaions in BRCA1(4153delA and 5382insC). There was 1 BRCA1(5382insC) mutation-positive patient in the other group and no mutation-positive patients in the positive margin group.

3438,"Dose-dependent white matter damage after brain radiotherapy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain radiotherapy is limited in part by damage to white matter, contributing to neurocognitive decline. We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy.

256,"The impact of multimodality therapy of distal esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas on treatment-related toxicity and complications. The benefit of multimodality therapy is clearly established for adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, but its impact on toxicity is not well defined. We reviewed data from prospective randomized trials to better define the risks of multimodality therapy. The rates of surgical mortality and complications range from 0% to 10% and 23% to 49%, respectively. Multimodality therapy increases acute toxicity. The rate of severe acute hematologic toxicity varies considerably between trials (3%-78%) and appears to be primarily attributable to chemotherapy. Common severe acute nonhematologic toxicities include esophagitis (16%-63%), infection (2%-30%), pain (3%-24%), and gastrointestinal (6%-60%) and cardiac (3%-19%) events. The individual contribution of each modality to nonhematologic toxicities is unclear, but toxicity is increased when adding radiosensitizing chemotherapy to radiotherapy. There is an acute decrease in quality of life with multimodality therapy; however, quality of life usually returns to, or exceeds, baseline by 12 months after therapy.

Aim: We assess the percentage of cases in which findings of distant disease through 18F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning lead to changes in the modality and/or intent of the treatment, or change in stage IV. Material(s) and Method(s): All the studies derived from the Radiotherapy department were retrospectively analysed. Those performed for radiotherapy planning were selected. Cases with distant disease findings were assessed, investigating changes in the modality or intent of treatment and change in stage IV. One thousand four hundred seventy six studies were derived from the Radiotherapy department between April/09 and December/13. Three hundred and seventy three (25,3%) were performed for radiotherapy planning (267 males and 106 females, mean age 68.2 years). The intention of radiotherapy was for radical treatment planning. Result(s): In 45 of these studies (12%) there were previously not suspected findings that suggested an upstage of the patients to a clinical stage IV. The unexpected disease was located more frequently in bone (12 patients), followed by lung (9 patients), liver (10), distant adenopathy (6 patients), brain (4 patients), adrenal glands (4 patients), spleen (1 patient) and multiple progression (1 patient).In twenty-six (26/45, 7%) of these patients the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed as true positive for distant metastasis with complementary examinations. In sixteen (16/26) of them the modality of treatment was changed. In ten of them (10/26) the intent of treatment was changed from curative to palliative. In three patients a second primary tumour was confirmed.In remaining sixteen (16/45) patients the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT could not be initially confirmed. The confirmation was made by monitoring progression in eleven patients, one patient remained with stable disease and four patients died without being able to confirm the findings. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET/CT studies in radiotherapy planning improve the staging of patients, leading to an upstage in a significant number of patients. Based upon the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the modality or the intent of treatment may radically change, (making unnecessary radiation) or changing the intent to palliative.",Excluded

Objectives Existence of therapy resistant glioma stem cells (GSC) is responsible for the high recurrence rate and incurability of glioblastomas. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity plays an essential role for self-renewal capacity and survival of GSC. Since these cells are supposed to be the source of tumor recurrence, a new paradigm targeting high resistant dormant GSC may provide a novel therapeutic model for malignant brain cancers. Thus, we examined the potential of the Sonic Hh ligand for sensitizing of GSC to endogenous nanoirradiation. Methods Primary GM cells were phenotyped using GSC markers by microscopy. GSC were isolated using CD133 microbeads. Existence and activity of Hh pathway was examined by SDS-PAGE and RT-PCR. For stimulation, GM cells and normal human astrocytes (NHA) were incubated with Shh (200 ng/ml for 5d) and with fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd, 1muM for 1h). Proliferation was determined by BrdU. Annexin-V visualized the apoptosis. Uptake and DNA incorporation of I-125-ITdU (250kBq/1*10^5 cells) were measured after 4d using gamma-counter. Killing efficiency was defined by means of intrinsic caspases activation and clonogenic survival. Results Sonic Hh ligand preferentially and efficiently activated GSC to enter the radiation sensitive G2/M phase. Concomitant inhibition with FdUrd and treatment with the Auger electron emitting thymidine analogue [I-125]ITdU led to fatal nano-irradiation in sensitized GCS. Targeting of proliferating GCS with DNA-incorporated [I-125]ITdU efficiently invoked the intrinsic apoptotic pathway despite active DNA repair mechanisms. Further, [I-125]ITdU completely inhibited survival of GCS. Analysis of non-stem glioblastoma cells and NHA revealed that GCS differentially responded to Sonic Hh ligand. Conclusions These data demonstrate a highly efficient and controllable singlecell kill therapeutic model for targeting glioma stem cells.",Excluded

Transportation of unstable neurosurgical patients involves risks that may lead to further deterioration and secondary brain injury from perturbations in physiological parameters. Mobile computerized tomography (CT) head scanning in the neurosurgery intensive care (NICU) is a new technique that minimizes the need to transport unstable patients. The authors have been using this device since June 1997 and have developed their own method of scanning such patients. Methods. The scanning procedure and radiation safety measures are described. The complications that occurred in 89 patients during transportation and conventional head CT scanning at the Department of Radiology were studied prospectively. These complications were compared with the ones that occurred during mobile CT scanning in 50 patients in the NICU. The duration of the procedures was recorded, and an estimation of the staff workload was made. Two patient groups, defined as high- and medium-risk cases, were studied. Medical and/or technical complications occurred during conventional CT scanning in 25% and 20% of the patients in the high- and medium-risk groups, respectively. During mobile CT scanning complications occurred in 4.3% of the high-risk group and 0% of the medium-risk group. Mobile CT scanning also took significantly less time, and the estimated personnel cost was reduced. Conclusions. Mobile CT scanning in the NICU is safe. It minimizes the risk of physiological deterioration and technical mishaps linked to intrahospital transport, which may aggravate secondary brain injury.

3550,"The white 'matter' in obsessive compulsive disorder: Effect of pharmacological treatment and symptom dimensions models. Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is highly heterogeneous in its manifestations, both across patients and within the same patient over time. The disorder is probably best described by a multidimensional model involving several symptom dimensions, whose precise number and phenotypes are debated. This heterogeneity partly explains, beyond methodological discrepancies, the inconsistency of results in current brain imaging research in the disorder, particularly in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Purpose(s): We aimed at investigating white matter (WM) alterations associated with OCD, controlling for the impact of variables known to affect WM structure, and specifically for the effect of current and lifetime pharmacological treatment. Then, we tested two different symptom dimensions models [1,2] within OCD patients, analysing theirWMcorrelates, for both prevailing current symptom dimension and symptom dimension at onset. Method(s): We compared 58 adult pure-OCD patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC), with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics on diffusion tensor images, using TFCE correction (p = 0.05). With respect to symptom dimensions, separate analyses were carried on the sole OCD sample. The diffusion measures Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were used as parameters of WM organisation. Result(s): The observed differences between OCD patients and HC were totally carried by the effect of previous and current medications. No differences were in fact observed between drugna ive patients and HC. Current medication was associated with a widespread decrease of FA and increase of RD throughout the whole brain. Lifetime treatment was associated with a decrease in FA in the tracts surrounding the thalami, site of major neurotransmitter alteration in OCD. In the analysis of symptom dimensions, only a finer-grained five-factors model [2] allowed for the identification of specific neural correlates. Patients having current Symmetry/Perfectionism dimension show a reduction in RD and MD in the body of corpus callosum and in left higher-order visual association tracts, including: left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and/or inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, patients having Doubt/Checking dimension at onset show a widespread reduction of AD, encompassing corpus callosum, and bilaterally the thalamic radiations, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Finally, patients having Rituals/Superstition dimension at onset show an increase in FA in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits: genu of corpus callosum, bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations and left external capsule. Conclusion(s): Present results confirm the effect of medications on WM in OCD [3], showing a large effect of current treatment on myelination and a site-specific, disorder-specific, effect of medications on brain systems. Furthermore, our findings provide support to a multidimensional model of OCD, and indicate that the distinction of clinically homogeneous dimensions is essential for the identification of reliable neural correlates. Finally, we evidence, to our knowledge for the first time, that onset symptom dimensions are associated with enduring alterations of WM structure. Onset symptom dimensions may reflect underlying endophenotypes, and our results suggest their relevance for future investigations on OCD neuroanatomy and aetiopathology.",Excluded
2997,"Validation of a death assay for Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae (L3) using propidium iodide in a rat model (Rattus norvegicus). Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a pathogenic nematode and the cause of neuroangiostrongyliasis, an eosinophilic meningitis more commonly known as rat lungworm disease. Transmission is thought to be primarily due to ingestion of infective third stage larvae (L3) in gastropods, on produce, or in contaminated water. The gold standard to determine the effects of physical and chemical treatments on the infectivity of A. cantonensis L3 larvae is to infect rodents with treated L3 larvae and monitor for infection, but animal studies are laborious and expensive and also raise ethical concerns. This study demonstrates propidium iodide (PI) to be a reliable marker of parasite death and loss of infective potential without adversely affecting the development and future reproduction of live A. cantonensis larvae. PI staining allows evaluation of the efficacy of test substances in vitro, an improvement upon the use of lack of motility as an indicator of death. Some potential applications of this assay include determining the effectiveness of various anthelmintics, vegetable washes, electromagnetic radiation and other treatments intended to kill larvae in the prevention and treatment of neuroangiostrongyliasis.

46,"Primary brain tumors in adults. Primary malignant brain tumors account for 2 percent of all cancers in U.S. adults. The most common malignant brain tumor is glioblastoma multiforme, and patients with this type of tumor have a poor prognosis. Previous exposure to high-dose ionizing radiation is the only proven environmental risk factor for a brain tumor. Primary brain tumors are classified based on their cellular origin and histologic appearance. Typical symptoms include persistent headache, seizures, nausea, vomiting, neurocognitive symptoms, and personality changes. A tumor can be identified using brain imaging, and the diagnosis is confirmed with histopathology. Any patient with chronic, persistent headache in association with protracted nausea, vomiting, seizures, change in headache pattern, neurologic symptoms, or positional worsening should be evaluated for a brain tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred initial imaging study. A comprehensive neurosurgical evaluation is necessary to obtain tissue for diagnosis and for possible resection of the tumor. Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize outside the central nervous system, and there is no standard staging method. Surgical resection of the tumor is the mainstay of therapy. Postoperative radiation and chemotherapy have improved survival in patients with high-grade brain tumors. Recent developments in targeted chemotherapy provide novel treatment options for patients with tumor recurrence. Primary care physicians play an important role in the perioperative and supportive treatment of patients with primary brain tumors, including palliative care and symptom control.

BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy (TT) and immunotherapies (ITs) have dramatically improved survival in metastatic melanoma (MM). However, their efficacy on brain metastasis (BM) remains limited and poorly documented.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive MM patients (pts) with BMs, all systematically upfront treated by Gamma-Knife (GK) at first BM and retreated in case of new BMs, from 2010 to 2015 at the time when ipilimumab BRAF +/- MEK inhibitors and anti-PD1 were introduced in practice. Survival after 1st GK (OS<sub>GK1</sub>) according to prognostic factors and treatment.RESULTS: Among 179 consecutive pts treated by GK, 109 received IT and/or TT after the 1st GK. Median OS<sub>GK1</sub> was 10.95 months and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 49.5% and 27.4%, respectively, versus a median overall survival (OS) of 2.29 months (p < .001) in those who did not receive IT or TT. In pts who initially had a single BM, median OS and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 14.46 months, 66.7% and 43.4%, respectively; in pts with 2-3 BMs: 8.85 months, 46.4% and 31%, respectively; in pts with >3 BMs: 7.25 months, 37.2% and 11.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis for OS<sub>GK1</sub> confirmed that IT and TT were significantly and highly protective. Best OS<sub>GK1</sub> was observed in BRAF-wild-type pts receiving anti-PD1 or in BRAF-mutated pts receiving BRAF-inhibitors and anti-PD1 (12.26 and 14.82 months, respectively).CONCLUSION: In real-life MM pts with BMs, a strategy aiming at controlling BM with GK together with TT and/or TT seems to achieve unprecedented survival rates.",Excluded

The current study aimed to investigate the effect of different low doses of gamma irradiation on hyperglycemia-induced brain injury. The aim was further extended to investigate the sub-chronic effect of low dose radiation on the neuronal damage induced by diabetes. To induce diabetes, male albino rats were injected with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg/day, for 9 successive days, subcutaneously). Different diabetic groups were irradiated with 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 Gy. The effect of low dose gamma irradiation on the hyperglycemia-induced brain damage based was analyzed at two levels: oxidative stress and apoptosis. The brain contents of glutathione, malondialdhyde and total nitrate/nitrite were measured to assess the oxidative stress. In order to evaluate the extent of the apoptotic changes in brain, tissue caspase-3 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and the degree of DNA fragmentation was estimated. Moreover, brain tissues were examined using light microscopy to evaluate the histological changes in different groups and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as an indicator for the brain tissue damage. Results indicated that exposure to 0.5 Gy ameliorated the hyperglycemia and subsequently inhibited oxidative stress and apoptosis. Radiation exposure at this dose level also increased the survival rate of diabetic animals.",Excluded

We investigate the impacts of sharp variations in solar and geomagnetic activity (GMA) at high latitudes on the human brain bioelectrical activity by means of the empirical structure function of multi-channel EEG. Ten healthy men ages 19 to 37 took part in the study. EEG was recor- ded daily over the 25 days test period that was marked by C- and M-class solar flares and geomagnetic storm levels in the G2-G3 range. The EEG signals were used for the estimate of the mul-tivariate temporal structure function (SF) of the first order in 8-dimensional space. The value of the SF correlation radius is used here as an estimation of a scale of the integral temporal correlation structure of multi-channel EEG, while the value of the SF horizontal asymptote is used as an estimation of the spatial correlation structure of EEG. It is shown that GMA variations make an even greater impact on the SF correlation radius, than on the SF asymptote. We reveal the disturbing and modulating effects of geomagnetic and solar activity on the SF parameters and its power spectrum. Thus, the SF of multi-channel EEG allows us to estimate the effects of heliogeophysical factors on the integrated brain reaction as a unitary system and may be used to investigate the environmental influence on the humans.",Excluded

Objectives C-CNS5161 (N-(2-chloro-5-methylthiophenyl)-N'-(3- methylthiophenyl)-N'-[ C]methylguanidine) has been successfully used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. However, no human dosimetry data has been published. We are planning to use this radiotracer for investigating NMDA receptor function in three categories of subjects: (i) systemic lupus erythematosus; (ii) traumatic brain injury; and (iii) Parkinson's disease. We have, therefore, undertaken PET imaging using <sup>11</sup>C-CNS5161 to measure whole body distribution of this radionuclide and estimate radiation dose to various organs. Methods Dynamic PET studies of the whole body were performed in five normal adult subjects. Regions-of-interest were drawn over the visualized structures. Resultant time-activity curves were generated and used to determine residence times for dosimetry calculations. S-factors were computed using the OLINDA/EXM software for each structure/organ. Results For <sup>11</sup>C-CNS5161, organ doses ranged from 0.0006 to 0.1455 rads/mCi. The critical organ for radiation burden was the lungs with a dose of 0.1455 rads/mCi. Radiation dose to the reproductive and blood forming organs were 0.0086, 0.0006 and 0.0074 rads/mCi for ovaries, testes, and red marrow, respectively. The effective dose equivalent (EDE) was 0.0392 rems/mCi. Conclusions The radiation dosimetry for C-CNS5161 for a standard single injection of 15 mCi will result in an EDE of 0.59 rems and lung dose of 2.18 rads in young normal subjects.",Excluded
2842,"Mechanisms of action for an anti-radiation vaccine in reducing the biological impact of high dose and dose-rate, low-linear energy transfer radiation exposure. The development of an anti-radiation vaccine could be very useful in reducing acute radiation syndromes. Existing principles for the treatment of acute radiation syndromes are based on the amelioration of progressive pathophysiological changes, using the concept of replacement therapy. Active immunization by small quantities of the essential radiation-induced systemic toxins of what we call the Specific Radiation Determinant (SRD) before irradiation increased duration of life among animals that were irradiated by lethal or sub-lethal doses of gamma-radiation. The SRD toxins possess antigenic properties that are specific to different forms of acute radiation sickness. Intramuscular injection of larger quantities of the SRD toxins induce signs and symptoms in irradiated naive animals similar to those observed in acute radiation syndromes, including death. Providing passive immunization, at variable periods of time following radiation, with preparations of immune-globulins directed at the SRD molecules, can confer some protection in the development of clinical sequelae in irradiated animals. Improved survival rates and times were observed in animals that received lower, sublethal doses of the same SRDs prior to irradiation. Therefore, active immunization can be induced by SRD molecules as a prophylaxis. The protective effects of the immunization begin to manifest 15-35 days after an injection of a biologically active SDR preparation. The SRD molecules are a group of radiation toxins with antigenic properties that correlate specifically with different forms of radiation disease. The SRD molecules are composed of glycoproteins and lipoproteins that accumulate in the lymphatic system of mammals in the first hours after irradiation, and preliminary analysis suggests that they may originate from cellular membrane components. The molecular weight of the SRD group ranges from 200-250 kDa. The SRD molecules were isolated from the lymphatic systems of laboratory animals that were irradiated with doses known to induce the development of cerebral (SRD-1), non-specific toxic effects (SRD-2), gastrointestinal (SRD-3) and hematological (bone marrow) (SRD-4) syndromes. Our results suggest that an anti-radiation vaccine can be developed for prophylactic use against radiation damage induced by acute exposure to significant doses of low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation for humans, including nuclear power workers, commercial and military pilots, cosmonauts/astronauts, nuclear-powered engine vessel operators and possibly even the civilian population in the case of a nuclear terrorism event.",Excluded
2347,"A case of paraplegia with piriformis syndrome. [Turkish, English]. Apart from being a neuropathy developed by the compression and irritation of piriformis muscle on the sciatic nerve, piriformis syndrome (PS) can also be caused by a trigger point without sciatic nerve involvement. Although it has been reported that PS could be seen in individuals at all activity levels, PS in patients who had spinal cord injury (SCI) has not been reported. In this study, a case of paraplegia, suffering from hip pain, who had been diagnosed and treated as PS was presented. A 62 years old woman complaining about pain and numbness in low back and right hip was admitted to our clinic. She was mobilized by crutches. From her anamnesis it was understood that she developed paraplegia after a fall two years ago. In her physical examination, she was diagnosed as ASIA: D T3 incomplete paraplegia. Her complaints had started 6 months ago after falling on her right hip. She had a severe pain with radicular radiation, during the deep palpation of the piriformis muscle. Compression of lumbar spinous processes were slightly painful. While FAIR, Pace, Beatty tests were positive on the right side, straight leg raising and the Laseque tests were both negative. For the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, 4 cc of 2% lidocaine+1 cc of betametazon dipropionate injection with a 22 G 88 mm Spinocan was done under the guidance of ultrasound into the piriformis muscle. The patient was diagnosed as PS as there was a significant relief of symptoms after the injection. When the risk factors that can cause PS were questioned, we learned that she had a habit of eating on the floor and sitting with her legs crossed. The patient's activities of daily living were organized and medical treatment, lumbosacral orthosis and piriformis stretching exercises were given. It was observed that her complaints diminished gradually in 1st. and 3rd. months controls. In conclusion, while neuropathic pain below the level of neurologic injury often suggest central pain in patients with SCI, PS is a must to be considered in the differential diagnosis of hip pain especially in patients with incomplete SCI.",Excluded
2352,"Zonisamide in Brain Tumor-Related Epilepsy: An Observational Pilot Study. OBJECTIVES: Epilepsy heavily affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients with brain tumor because in addition to taking treatments for the oncological illness, patients are required to live with the long-term taking of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The AEDs' adverse effects are common in these patients and can negatively influence their perceptions of their QoL. We conducted an observational pilot study in patients with brain tumor-related epilepsy to verify efficacy, tolerability, and impact on QoL and global neurocognitive performances of zonisamide (ZNS) in add-on.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 13 patients (5 females, 8 males; mean age, 49.6 years) presenting uncontrolled seizures. At first visit and at final follow-up at 6 months, patients underwent neurological examination, evaluation of adverse events, and cognitive and QoL tests. A seizure diary was given.RESULTS: Eight patients underwent chemotherapy, 3 underwent radiotherapy, and 5 had disease progression. Mean dosage of ZNS at final follow-up was 300 mg/d.Of 9 patients who reached the sixth month follow-up, the mean weekly seizure number before ZNS had been 3.2 +/- 5.0, and at final follow-up, the mean weekly seizure number was 0.18 +/- 0.41 (P = 0.05). Compared with baseline, we observed stability in all cognitive domains, except for verbal fluency that significantly worsened. Results on QoL tests showed that QoL remained unchanged over time, which could indicate that ZNS did not influence the patients' perceived QoL.CONCLUSIONS: Zonisamide as add-on in our patients seems to be well tolerated and efficacious in controlling seizures. Despite having limitations represented by the fact that our study is observational, with a small study population and a short follow-up period, our results confirm that when choosing an AED, in addition to efficacy, the drug's effect on patients' QoL also needs to be considered, especially for patients facing many psychosocial challenges, such as those with brain tumor-related epilepsy.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate if thin-sliced reformatted non-contrast CT scans could be reliably used to detect and measure size of the thrombus in patients with LVOs. Background(s): Thin-sliced reformatted non-contrast CT head are not considered sensitive enough for thrombus detection. CTA is done to confirm large vessel occlusion. CTA adds extra radiation and contrast. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent acute endovascular intervention for LVOs at a community based, university affiliated comprehensive stroke center during two year period (Jan 2015-Dec 2016) was done. The raw data of non-enhanced CT scans and CTAs were collected. All raw data were reconstructed with thin slices of 0.625 mm using standard GE software. Vessel diameter and clot length were measured on both CT and CTA. (5- mm maximum intensity projections of the thin slices on CT and axial/coronal projections on CTA). Each patient's CT and CTA were paired for length and diameter in millimeters. Paired two sample hypothesis test was run on SPSS. Result(s): 926 patients presented with acute ischemic stroke during the specified time period. Of those 99 were LVOs that received endovascular treatment of which, 37 had both CT and CTA done and had intracranial lesions. Mean clot length was 13.99 (SD 5.34) on thin slices CT and 14.18 (SD 5.64) on CTA. Vessel diameter was 2.83 (SD 0.54) on thin sliced CT and 2.55 (SD 0.51) on CTA. There was no significant difference in estimated clot length done on CT as compared with CTA. (P=0.601) There was significant difference in estimated vessel diameter on CT as compared with CTA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer type and the second most common cause of cancer death among US men. This study, adapted a previously reported nanoparticle-directed photothermal treatment of brain tumors to the treatment of prostate disease by using normal canine prostate in vivo, directly injected with a suspension of nanoparticles as a proxy for prostate tumor, and by developing laser dosimetry for prostate which is marginally ablative in native tissue, yet producing photothermal coagulation in prostate tissue containing nanoparticles.METHODS: Canine prostates were exposed by surgical laparotomy and directly injected with suspensions of nanoparticles (nanoshells) and irradiated by a NIR laser source delivered percutaneously by an optical fiber catheter and isotropic diffuser. The photothermal lesions were permitted to resolve for up to 8 days, at which time each animal was euthanized, necropsied, and the prostate taken for histopathological and elemental analysis.RESULTS: Nanoparticles were retained for up to 4 hours in prostate and served as a proxy for prostate tumor. A marginally ablative laser dose of 3.0 W for 3 minutes was developed which would yield 4 mm-radius coagulo-necrotic lesions if nanoparticles were present.CONCLUSION: We have shown that the addition of nanoshells to native tissue, combined with a marginally ablative laser dose can generate ablative thermal lesions, and that the radial extent of the thermal lesions is strictly confined to within ~4 mm of the optical fiber with sub-millimeter uncertainty. This, in turn, suggests a means of precise tumor ablation with an ability to obviate damage to critical structures limited primarily by the precision with which the optical fiber applicator can be placed. In so doing, it should be possible to realize a precise, nerve bundle and urethra sparing prostate cancer treatment using a minimally invasive, percutaneous approach.",Excluded
1416,"ATP consumption by mammalian rod photoreceptors in darkness and in light. Why do vertebrates use rods and cones that hyperpolarize, when in insect eyes a single depolarizing photoreceptor can function at all light levels? We answer this question at least in part with a comprehensive assessment of ATP consumption for mammalian rods from voltages and currents and recently published physiological and biochemical data. In darkness, rods consume 10(8) ATP s(-1), about the same as Drosophila photoreceptors. Ion fluxes associated with phototransduction and synaptic transmission dominate; as in CNS, the contribution of enzymes of the second-messenger cascade is surprisingly small. Suppression of rod responses in daylight closes light-gated channels and reduces total energy consumption by >75%, but in Drosophila light opens channels and increases consumption 5-fold. Rods therefore provide an energy-efficient mechanism not present in rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Rods are metabolically less ""costly"" than cones, because cones do not saturate in bright light and use more ATP s(-1) for transducin activation and rhodopsin phosphorylation. This helps to explain why the vertebrate retina is duplex, and why some diurnal animals like primates have a small number of cones, concentrated in a region of high acuity.",Excluded

1012,"Slice accelerated diffusion-weighted imaging at ultra-high field strength. Purpose Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data with very high isotropic resolution can be obtained at 7T. However, for extensive brain coverage, a large number of slices is required, resulting in long acquisition times (TAs). Recording multiple slices simultaneously (SMS) promises to reduce the TA. Methods A combination of zoomed and parallel imaging is used to achieve high isotropic resolution dMRI data with a low level of distortions at 7T. The blipped-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) approach is used to acquire several slices simultaneously. Due to their high radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and ensuing specific absorption rate (SAR) constraints, the commonly used multiband (MB) RF pulses for SMS imaging are inefficient at 7T and entail long repetition times, counteracting the usefulness of SMS acquisitions. To address this issue, low SAR multislice Power Independent of Number of Slices RF pulses are employed. Results In vivo dMRI results with and without SMS acceleration are presented at different isotropic spatial resolutions at ultra high field strength. The datasets are recorded at a high angular resolution to detect fiber crossings. Conclusion From the results and compared with earlier studies at these resolutions, it can be seen that scan time is significantly reduced, while image quality is preserved.
