7,"Risk analysis of the mortality from the diseases of the circulatory system in the ural cohort of emergency-irradiated population for the years 1950-2015. [Russian]. The paper describes for the first time the results of the radiation effect study using the example of the analysis of circulatory system disease mortality in newly established cohort combining the population exposed in 1950-1960 due to 2 radiation incidents in the Southern Urals (the Techa River and East-Urals radioactive Trace). The cohort consists of 60,205 people. Over a 65-year follow up period 14,830 deaths from all diseases of the circulatory system were registered. Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence. The obtained results are in good agreement with those received in the analysis of the effect in the Techa River Cohort in 2013. The latter covered a 53-year period (with minimum latent period of 15 years) and revealed statistically significant linear dose response for all diseases of the circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy - 0.036) and ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy - 0.056).

11,"Gene expression in rat vestibular and reticular structures during and after space flight. Space flight produces profound changes of neuronal activity in the mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs)] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was compared to that of ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and 1 and 14 days after landing. An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight.",Included

They approximately involved in all living processes, they play an important role in the hormones and enzymes activities. The present study demonstrate the biosensitivity of certain organs (spleen, intestine, heart and brain) in rats exposed to low doses of gamma-radiation by determine the effectiveness on essential metal levels. Rats were exposed to 0.06, 0.126 and 0.227Gy as a total doses at a low dose rate 2.5mGy/h by two models of exposure, continuous and fractionated (along one and two weeks). Results indicated that the metal levels affected by the time exposure and organ sensitivity. Continuous exposure manifested increase in brain Fe, spleen Cu and Ca and decrease Ca in intestine and brain at all doses. After one week, intestine Cu and heart Zn decreased. After two weeks, decrease in Fe levels was observed in intestine, heart and brain at all doses. Also heart Zn and brain Ca decreased, Ca heart increased where Cu exhibit elevation in spleen and lowering in intestine at all doses. The statistic analysis presented significant effect between groups according the time factor and/or dose levels on Fe and Ca in all organs. Also significant effect present in Zn levels due to the time factor and/or dose levels in all organs except intestine. In conclusion, the rat organs have been responded to the low doses of gamma-radiation at low dose rate by significant changes in essential metals concentrations. © 2013 The Egyptian Society of Radiation Sciences and Applications.",Included
46,"Dose-response curves and tolerance doses for late functional changes in the normal rat brain after stereotactic radiosurgery evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging: influence of end points and follow-up time. Late reaction of normal tissue is still a limiting factor in radiotherapy and radiosurgery of patients with brain tumors. Few quantitative data in terms of dose-response curves are available. In the present study, 99 animals were irradiated stereotactically at the right frontal lobe using a linear accelerator and single doses between 26 and 50 Gy. The diameter of the spherical dose distribution was 4.7 mm (80% isodose). Dose-response curves for late changes in the normal brain at 20 months were measured using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The dependence of the dose-response curves on the follow-up time and the definition of the biological end point were determined. Tolerance doses were calculated at several effect probability levels and times after irradiation. The MRI changes were found to be dependent on dose and progressive in time. At 20 months, the tolerance doses at a 50% effect probability level were 39.6 +/- 1.0 Gy and 42.4 +/- 1.4 Gy for changes in T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. These dose-response curves can be used for further quantitative investigations on the influence of various treatment parameters, such as the application of charged particles, radiopharmaceuticals or the variation of tissue oxygenation.",Included
49,"The influence of minor doses of ionizing radiation on the development of cerebrovascular diseases. [Russian]. Overall 1,104 persons exposed to industrial radiation were examined for the effect of minor doses of ionizing radiation on the development of the initial forms of cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). Use was made of an original method of five-factorial screening prediction of the development of CVD. As a result of the examination, 603 persons (54.6%) made up a group at greater risk for cerebrovascular insufficiency. Arterial hypertension was found to be the leading risk factor while the age 45-49 years turned out most dangerous from the standpoint of the onset of the diseases under consideration. No relationship was established between the total dose of external radiation and the risk of the development of cerebrovascular disorders. 96 persons at greater risk for CVD were subjected to a thorough clinical and instrumental examination. Of these, 79.2% appeared to have initial manifestations of brain circulatory insufficiency and stage I dyscirculatory encephalopathy.",Included
53,"Utility of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Modern Era with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance. Aims: To retrospectively analyse the impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on survival and intracranial progression in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) in the modern era of widespread magnetic resonance imaging brain screening. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with LS-SCLC treated within our network between 2009 and 2020 who responded to initial therapy were stratified by receipt of PCI and stage of disease. A propensity score match analysis was carried out for stage II-III patients. Overall and neurological survival were defined as time to death and presumed death due to uncontrolled intracranial disease, respectively. Brain metastasis-free survival and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival were defined as freedom from intracranial progression and symptomatic intracranial progression, respectively. The effect of PCI on these outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Result(s): In total, 243 (69.6%) of 349 patients received PCI. On multivariate analysis in the propensity matched stage II-III cohort, PCI was a significant predictor of improved neurological survival (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.65; P = 0.01), brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51; P < 0.01) and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55; P < 0.01), but not improved overall survival. Two-year neurological survival estimates within the propensity matched cohort were 96.8% (95% confidence interval 87.6-99.2%) with PCI and 77.2% (95% confidence interval 63.0-86.4%) without PCI and 1- and 2-year estimates of incidence of brain metastases were 3.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7%) and 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6-23.5%) in the PCI group and 31.6% (95% confidence interval 22.1-43.9%) and 40.4% (95% confidence interval 29.2-54.0%) in the no PCI group, respectively. Conclusion(s): In the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging screening, PCI was associated with reduced incidence of intracranial progression in patients with stage II-III LS-SCLC who respond to initial therapy. This, importantly, translated to a decreased risk of neurological death within our propensity matched cohort, without significant improvement in overall survival.

56,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain caused by acute radiation injuries. Moderate to severe acute pain is a common consequence of fullcourse radiotherapy. Improved analgesics are needed, but therapeutic development requires an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie acute radiation-associated pain (RAP). Our preliminary data suggest that transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels on sensory neurons play important roles in RAP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of various Trp channels in acute RAP using a mouse model of oral radiation-induced mucositis. Mice underwent high dose single fraction lingual irradiation or sham irradiation. This resulted in glossitis that was most severe at 10-12 days postirradiation and resolved within 20 days. Micewere euthanized on days 1, 5, 11, 21, and 45 post-irradiation. Functional analysis of trigeminal ganglia neurons was assessed via calcium imaging; this revealed significantly increased proportions of neurons that were sensitive to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), histamine (TRPV4 partial agonist), or TNF-alpha (a general inflammatory marker). These changes were seen as early as 1-day post-irradiation and lasted until the 21st day. Via quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented Trpv1 overexpression in the trigeminal ganglia neurons of tongueirradiated mice on days 11 and 21. Together, these results indicate that both TRPV1 and TRPV4 are activated and upregulated, and contribute to the acute response of oral tissues to therapeutic irradiation. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing these two Trp channels as potential targets for RAP mitigation in human and animal cancer patients.",Included

Under neurological investigation were 113 patients with different degrees of severity of acute radiation disease (ARD). The patients were relatively evenly irradiated by beta- and gamma-rays as a result of CPP accident. The onset time and markedness of the signs of primary reaction were related to ARD severity. Early appearance of the signs of disturbances in the central nervous system functional state suggested a stronger affliction, malignant course and fatal outcome of the disease. Ii ARD patients with IV-th and III-rd degree of severity the syndromes observed were these: acute radiation encephalopathy immediately caused by the ionizing irradiation of the CNS, and a secondary radiation-toxic encephalopathy. The hemorrhagic lesioning of CNS and cerebral hemispheres were noted in terminal stages. In rehabilitation phases, neurasthenic and neurovascular syndromes appeared irrespective of the ARD severity.",Included

The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included

The effects of partial rat brain irradiation on the spatial orientation and learning ability of rats were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, which was performed once before and two times after the irradiation. At the same time morphological changes were detected by MRI to define the time-point for histological examinations. Irradiation of 40-Gy resulted in moderate neurological deficit both at the level of cognitive function and morphology after 4 weeks of irradiation. The MWM test was found to be a highly sensitive tool for the detection of neurofunctional impairment. We found that the place navigational function of the ratswas impaired by the irradiation and the treatment with GPC could prevent this damage.

241,"Induction of c-fos and junB mRNA following in vivo brain irradiation. Although radiotherapy is a front line treatment for brain tumors, little is known about the in vivo molecular responses of brain to irradiation. In this study, expression of c-fos, c-jun and junB immediate-early genes were followed in mouse brain after irradiation. C-fos and junB, but not c-jun, mRNA was induced within 15 min in unanesthetized irradiated mice. Induction was transient and lasted < 4 h. The response was dose-dependent with increases in c-fos and junB mRNA levels after dose of > or = 2 and 7 Gy, respectively. Anesthesia of mice with pentobarbitol delayed the increases in mRNA expression and the response was attenuated. Pre-treatment of mice with dexamethasone, in a schedule which suppressed acute-phase gene expression after brain irradiation, did not significantly change c-fos and junB induction. Our results show that c-fos and junB responses occur in the brain in response to irradiation and that they can be modified by pentobarbital treatment but suggest that there is no direct correlation between the level of mRNA expression and later expression of cytokines or other acute-phase response genes.",Included

INTRODUCTION: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors the main dose-limiting tissue is found in the kidneys because of tubular reabsorption and retention of radioactivity. The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE.",Included
264,"Implication of prostaglandins and histamine H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors in radiation-induced temperature responses of rats. Exposure of rats to 1-15 Gy gamma radiation (<sup>60</sup>Co) induced hyperthermia, whereas 20-200 Gy induced hypothermia. Exposure either to the head or the whole body to 10 Gy induced hyperthermia, while body-only exposure produced hypothermia. This observation indicates that radiation-induced fever is a result of a direct effect on the brain. The hyperthermia due to 10 Gy was significantly attenuated by the pre- or post-treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Hyperthermia was also altered by the central administration of a mu-receptor antagonist naloxone but only at low doses of radiation. These findings suggest that radiation-induced hyperthermia may be mediated through the synthesis and release of prostaglandins in the brain and to a lesser extent to the release of endogenous opioid peptides. The release of histamine acting on H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors may be involved in radiation-induced hypothermia, since both the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, mepyramine, and H<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist, cimetidine, antagonized the hypothermia. The results of these studies suggest that the release of neurohumoral substances induced by exposure to ionizing radiation is dose dependent and has different consequences on physiological processes such as the regulation of body temperature. Furthermore, the antagonism of radiation-induced hyperthermia by indomethacin may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of fever resulting from accidental irradiations.",Included
270,"High dietary iron increases oxidative stress and radiosensitivity in the rat retina and vasculature after exposure to fractionated gamma radiation. Radiation exposure in combination with other space environmental factors including microgravity, nutritional status, and deconditioning is a concern for long-duration space exploration missions. Astronauts experience altered iron homeostasis due to adaptations to microgravity and an iron-rich food system. Iron intake reaches three to six times the recommended daily allowance due to the use of fortified foods on the International Space Station. Iron is associated with certain optic neuropathies and can potentiate oxidative stress. This study examined the response of eye and vascular tissue to gamma radiation exposure (3 Gy fractionated at 37.5 cGy per day every other day for 8 fractions) in rats fed an adequate-iron diet or a high-iron diet. Twelve-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: adequate-iron diet/no radiation (CON), high-iron diet/no radiation (IRON), adequate-iron diet/radiation (RAD), and high-iron diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals were maintained on the corresponding iron diet for 2 weeks before radiation exposure. As previously published, the high-iron diet resulted in elevated blood and liver iron levels. Dietary iron overload altered the radiation response observed in serum analytes, as evidenced by a significant increase in catalase levels and smaller decrease in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity levels. 8-OHdG immunostaining, showed increased intensity in the retina after radiation exposure. Gene expression profiles of retinal and aortic vascular samples suggested an interaction between the response to radiation and high dietary iron.

Low-dose irradiation induces various stimulating effects, especially activation of the biological defense system including antioxidative and immune functions. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cell damage and death and can induce many types of diseases. This paper reviews new insights into inhibition of ROS-related diseases with low-dose irradiation or radon inhalation. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before or after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment inhibits hepatopathy in mice. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before ischemia-reperfusion injury or cold-induced brain injury also inhibits edema. These findings suggest that low-dose X-irradiation has antioxidative effects due to blocking the damage induced by free radicals or ROS. Moreover, radon inhalation increases superoxide dismutase activity in many organs and inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. These findings suggest that radon inhalation also has antioxidative effects. This antioxidative effect against CCl4-induced hepatopathy is comparable to treatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at a dose of 500 mg/kg weight, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment at a dose of 300 mg/kg weight, and is due to activation of antioxidative functions. In addition, radon inhalation inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema, suggesting that radon inhalation has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, radon inhalation inhibits formalin-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that radon inhalation relieves pain. Thus, low-dose irradiation very likely activates the defense systems in the body, and therefore, contributes to preventing or reducing ROS-related injuries, which are thought to involve peroxidation.",Included

In this study, we characterized the effects of body-only proton irradiation (excluding brain) and CHL on the response to a bacterial challenge in 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were given CHL (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and irradiated (0 or 3 Gy) 60-90 min later. Ten days post-irradiation, mice were inoculated with 5e7 CFU of Escherichia coli (i.p.) and euthanized 90-120 min later. We characterized blood and splenic leukocyte population distributions (flow cytometry and hematology), cytokine levels (multiplexed cytokine analysis) and oxidative burst capacity. Radiation decreased virtually all splenic leukocyte counts while increasing oxidative burst capacity. In the blood, radiation decreased lymphocytes but increased innate subsets. Sympathetic blockade did not counter most of these radiation effects. This suggests that the disruptive effect of TBI on brain-immune communication is dependent on direct exposure to the brain.",Included

363,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation. Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included
364,"Ionizing radiation induces neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells via PI3-kinase and p53-dependent pathways. PURPOSE: The influence of ionizing radiation (IR) on neuronal differentiation is not well defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of IR on the differentiation of Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and the involvement of tumor protein 53 (p53) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during this process.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were exposed to (137)Cs gamma-rays at 4, 8 or 16 Gy. After incubation for 72 h with or without inhibitors of p53, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other kinases, the neuronal differentiation of irradiated Neuro-2a cells was examined through analyzing neurite outgrowth and neuronal maker expression and the activation of related signaling proteins by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. The change of neuronal marker was examined using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The irradiation of Neuro-2a cells significantly increased the neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuronal markers (neuronal nuclei [NeuN], microtubule-associated protein 2 [Map2], growth associated protein-43 [GAP-43], and Ras-related protein 13 [Rab13]). Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells.",Included

In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",Included

The question of whether bystander and abscopal effects are the same is unclear. Our experimental system enables us to address this question by allowing irradiated organisms to partner with unexposed individuals. Organs from both animals and appropriate sham and scatter dose controls are tested for expression of several endpoints such as calcium flux, role of 5HT, reporter assay cell death and proteomic profile. The results show that membrane related functions of calcium and 5HT are critical for true bystander effect expression. Our original inter-animal experiments used fish species whole body irradiated with low doses of X-rays, which prevented us from addressing the abscopal effect question. Data which are much more relevant in radiotherapy are now available for rats which received high dose local irradiation to the implanted right brain glioma. The data were generated using quasi-parallel microbeams at the biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France. This means we can directly compare abscopal and ""true"" bystander effects in a rodent tumour model. Analysis of right brain hemisphere, left brain and urinary bladder in the directly irradiated animals and their unirradiated partners strongly suggests that bystander effects (in partner animals) are not the same as abscopal effects (in the irradiated animal). Furthermore, the presence of a tumour in the right brain alters the magnitude of both abscopal and bystander effects in the tissues from the directly irradiated animal and in the unirradiated partners which did not contain tumours, meaning the type of signal was different.",Included
433,"Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation. Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for brain tumors but it can cause delayed progressive cognitive decline and memory deficits. Previous studies suggested that this neurocognitive dysfunction might be linked to the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, little is known regarding how to reduce the cognitive impairment caused by radiation therapy. To investigate whether environmental enrichment (EE) promotes neurogenesis and cognitive function after irradiation, irradiated gerbils were housed in EE for 2 months and evaluated by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function, and immunohistochemical analysis for neurogenesis. Our results demonstrated that even relatively low doses (5-10 Gy) of irradiation could acutely abolish precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus by more than 90%. This reduction in precursor proliferation was persistent and led to a significant decline in the granule cell population 9 months later. EE housing enhanced the number of newborn neurons and increased residual neurogenesis. EE also significantly increased the total number of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, irradiated animals after EE housing showed a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory during the water-maze test and in rotorod motor learning over a 5-day training paradigm. In conclusion, EE has a positive impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery in irradiated adult gerbils. Our data suggest that there is still a considerable amount of plasticity remaining in the hippocampal progenitor cells in adult animals after radiation injury, which can become a target of therapeutic intervention for radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction.",Included

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant role of melatonin against radiation-induced cataract in the rat lens after total cranial irradiation with a single 5 Gray (Gy) dose of gamma irradiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experiment. The rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The control group did not receive melatonin or irradiation but received both 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally and sham irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The melatonin plus IR group received irradiation to the total cranium plus 5 mg/kg/day melatonin intraperitoneally. The melatonin group received only 5 mg/kg/day melatonin plus sham-irradiation. Biochemical parameters measured in murine lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens antioxidant capacity, as measured by levels of total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activity, significantly increased in melatonin, control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the IR group. Lens glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased in control and melatonin groups when compared with the IR group. Lens malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly increased in the IR group when compared with control, melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups. Lens TSSA and NSSA activities significantly decreased in control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the melatonin group. Lens GST activity significantly increased in the control group when compared with melatonin plus IR group. Lens GRD activity significantly increased in melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with control group.CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin reduces oxidative stress markers and augments anti-oxidant capacity in the rat lens.",Included
456,"Protection of normal brain cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis by a mitochondria-targeted triphenyl-phosphonium-nitroxide: a possible utility in glioblastoma therapy. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included
460,"MRI changes in the rat hippocampus following proton radiosurgery. PURPOSE: To define radiographic dose-response relationships for proton radiosurgery using a rat brain model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A group of 23 rats was treated with Bragg peak proton beam irradiation involving the right hippocampus. Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction technique. One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue.",Included

478,"Terrestrial isopods congregate under a low-level beta-emitter source. Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, but very few experiments have investigated the biological effects of the natural background radiation at very low doses (>10 mGy/yr). We examined whether the background radiation, or radiation of a slightly higher level, has a role in evoking changes in behaviors of terrestrial isopods (woodlice). Upon exposure to a source giving 15 times the background level placed at one end of a box, a significant increase in the number of woodlice gathering under the beta-source was observed with time, as compared with the sham control. Terrestrial isopods have chemoreceptors (the olfactory system) on the terminal segment of their antennae. An additional experiment confirmed the involvement of these antennae in the radiation effect on behavior. After the excision of the antennae, no beta-taxis response was observed. The behavior of the group exposed to the source giving 30 times the background tended to decrease gradually in the area of the source, and the individuals aggregated in the area away from the source. Thus, the olfactory sensor in the antennae may be an important organ involved in the prompt response to radiation exposure, and the discrimination of the radiation field strengths of radioisotopes.",Included

While systemic injection of the radioprotectant S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) did not block hyperthermia induced by exposure to 10 Gy of gamma radiation, central administration did attenuate it. The dephosphorylated metabolite of WR-2721, N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane (WR-1065), accentuated radiation-induced hypothermia by both routes of administration. In brain homogenates, oxygen uptake was inhibited by WR-2721 but elevated by WR-1065. These results suggest that the antagonism of radiation-induced hypothermia found only after central administration of WR-2721 is due to its direct actions and not to its dephosphorylated metabolite and that this effect may be correlated with the inhibition by WR-2721 of oxygen uptake.",Included

Background: The relationship between whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) dose with intracranial tumor control and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases (BM) is largely unknown. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 595 NSCLC BM patients treated consecutively at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between 2013 to 2015. We assigned the patients into 4 dose groups of WBRT: none, < 30, 30-39, and >= 40 Gy and assessed their relationship with OS and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS). Cox models were utilized. Covariates included sex, age, KPS, BM lesions, extracranial metastasis, BM and lung tumor resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and focal radiotherapy modalities. Result(s): Patients had a mean age of 59 years and were 44% female. Their median survival time (MST) of OS and iPFS were 9.3 and 8.9 months. Patients receiving none (344/58%), < 30 (30/5%), 30-39 (93/16%), and >= 40 (128/22%) Gy of WBRT had MST of OS (iPFS) of 7.3 (6.8), 6.0 (5.4), 10.3 (11.9) and 11.9 (11.9) months, respectively. Compared to none, other WBRT groups had adjusted HRs for OS - 1.23 (p > 0.20), 0.72 (0.08), 0.61 (< 0.00) and iPFS - 1.63 (0.03), 0.71 (0.06), 0.67 (< 0.01). Compared to 30-39 Gy, WBRT dose >=40 Gy was not associated with improved OS and iPFS (all p > 0.40). Stratified analyses by 1-3 and >= 4 BM lesions and adjustment analyses by each prognostic index of RPA class, Lung-GPA and Lung-molGPA supported these relationships as well.

The prepatent period advanced with increasing exposure of infected blood to radiation, suggesting some degree of attenuation. At 26, 28 and 30 krad, the infections were transient and the parasites were morphologically abnormal. It is thought that the amount of radiation required to render the parasites non-viable is about 45 krad for an inoculum of 10(6) parasites. There is evidence that exoerythrocytic stages may be more susceptible to gamma-rays than are blood parasites. Chickens were inoculated three times, over a period of four weeks, with vaccines prepared from gamma-irradiated infected blood and brain tissue.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restenosis complicates a significant proportion of endovascular and open vascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy. In contrast to the primary atheroma, restenosis is characterized by intimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that gamma radiation would reduce restenosis by limiting intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.METHODS: To demonstrate the effect of gamma radiation on smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo, a standardized bilateral carotid balloon catheter arterial injury was produced in 37 rats. A single dose of 750, 1500, or 2250 cGy (1cGy = 1 rad) gamma radiation was delivered to the right carotid artery at either 1 or 2 days after injury; the shielded contralateral carotid artery served as matched control. At 21 days after injury, vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ, and cross-sectional area of neointima was determined from axial sections using image analysis.RESULTS: Marked reductions in neointimal cross-sectional area were demonstrated in vessels subjected to 1500- and 2250-cGy radiation at both 1 and 2 days after injury. A less prominent effect was noted for 750 cGy, reaching statistical significance only at 2 days after injury. By two-way ANOVA, radiation dose (P = .0002), timing of radiation delivery (P = .003), and an interaction between timing and dose (P = .0278) were significantly associated with reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. At 1500 cGy, delivery of radiation 1 day after injury inhibited neointimal hyperplasia more prominently than the same dose 2 days after injury; a dose-response relation was evident at 1 day.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation may be an important adjunctive therapy for reducing the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty or endarterectomy.",Included

Past work has shown that neural precursor cells are predisposed to redox sensitive changes, and that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the acute and persistent changes that occur within the irradiated CNS. Irradiation leads to a marked rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that correlates with oxidative endpoints in vivo and reductions in neurogenesis. To better understand the impact of oxidative stress on neural precursor cells, and to determine if radiation-induced oxidative damage and precursor cell loss after irradiation could be reduced, a series of antioxidant compounds (EUK-134, EUK-163, EUK-172, EUK-189) were tested, three of which possess both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and one (EUK-163) whose only significant activity is SOD. Our results show that these SOD/catalase mimetics apparently increase the oxidation of a ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye, particularly after short (12 h) treatments, but that longer treatments (24 h) decrease oxidation attributable to radiation-induced ROS. Similarly, other studies found that cells incubated with CuZnSOD showed some increase in intracellular ROS levels. Subsequent data suggested that the dye-oxidising capabilities of the EUK compounds were linked to differences in their catalase activity and, most likely, their ability to catalyse peroxidative pathways. In unirradiated mice, the EUK-134 analogue induced some decrease of proliferating precursor cells and immature neurons 48 h after radiation, an effect that may be attributable to cytotoxicity and/or inhibition of precursor proliferation. In irradiated mice, a single injection of EUK-134 was not found to be an effective radioprotector at acute times (48 h). The present results support continued development of our in vitro model as a tool for predicting certain in vivo responses, and suggest that in some biological systems the capability to scavenge superoxide but produce excess H(2)O(2), as is known for CuZnSOD, may be potentially deleterious. Our results also show that the ability of catalase mimetics, like true catalases, to catalyse peroxidase reactions can complicate the interpretation of data obtained with certain fluorescent ROS-indicator dyes.",Included

Total background ionizing radiation was also significantly correlated with AD death rate in 50 states and the District of Columbia (r = 0.452, p = 0.001).

PURPOSE: To determine if the brain's response to single doses predicts its response to 'biologically equivalent' fractionated doses.METHODS: Young adult male Fischer 344 rats were whole-brain irradiated with either single 11, 14, or 16.5 Gy doses of (137)Cs gamma rays or their 'biologically equivalent' 20, 30, or 40 Gy fractionated doses (fWBI) delivered in 5 Gy fractions, twice/week for 2, 3, or 4 weeks, respectively. At 2 months post-irradiation, cellular markers of inflammation (total, activated, and newborn microglia) and neurogenesis (newborn neurons) were measured in 40 mum sections of the dentate gyrus (DG).RESULTS: Although the total number of microglia in the DG/hilus was not significantly different (p > 0.7) in unirradiated, single dose, and fWBI rats, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.003) increase in the percent-activated microglia; fWBI did not (p > 0.1). Additionally, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.002) dose-dependent increase in surviving newborn microglia; fWBI did not (p < 0.8). Although total proliferation in the DG was reduced equally by single and fWBI doses, single doses produced a significant dose-dependent (p < 0.02) decrease in surviving newborn neurons; fWBI did not (p > 0.6).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the rat brain's cellular response to single doses often does not predict its cellular response to 'biologically equivalent' fWBI doses.",Included

PURPOSE: To investigate homology and stress response of p53 (a 53 kDa tumor suppressor protein) orthologue in Sf9 Lepidopteran insect cell line that exhibits very high radioresistance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, degenerate RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, flow cytometry and immuno-fluorescence microscopy were used for characterizing structural and functional features of Sfp53 (Spodoptera frugiperda p53) in gamma-irradiated or etoposide-treated Sf9 insect and BMG-1 (brain malignant glioma) human cells. Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity. While its nuclear translocation and ATM/ATR dependence were similar to hp53, the cytoplasmic localization and subdued accumulation following gamma-irradiation indicate functional differences from human cells.",Included

Changes in pinealocytes (PC) were analysed using quantitative electron microscopy in 240 adult male rats from first minutes up to 180 days after their continuous exposure to bright light (CLE) for 48 hours, X-ray irradiation (XRI) or their combination (CE). After CLE early changes of PC included the reduction of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi complex and synaptic ribbons. At 24 hours and 10 days PC secretory activity was increased, while their ultrastructural organization was normalized by 30-180 days. 10 days after XRI degenerative changes were detected in PC that included dilation, fragmentation and vacuolization of RER cisterns, mitochondrial swelling, appearance of large vacuoles and osmiophilic inclusions, increase in lysosome content. Volume density of mitochondria and RER was lower, while that of Golgi complex was higher than in control. PC ultrastructure was restored 30-180 days after XRI. Following CE, the changes in PC ultrastructural organization were more significant at all time interval studied than after the action of single factors. The results obtained indicate that CLE increased the extent of postradiation changes in PC ultrastructural organization during the early time intervals after XRI and at the peak of radiation sickness development.",Included

Confluent monolayers of capillary endothelial cells derived from Mongolian gerbil brain were irradiated with a single exposure of x-rays, and their radiosensitivity and sequential changes in morphology, staining intensity for factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII RAg), and capacity to produce prostacyclin (PGI2) were examined. The radiobiologic parameters that characterized the dose-response survival curve for these cells were found to be n = 1.9, Dq = 140 rad, and D0 = 190 rad. Morphologically, nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation of cytoplasm, and giant cell formation occurred in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours from irradiation. Decreased staining intensity for F VIII RAg was observed in morphologically affected cells. The capacity to synthesize PGI2 was significantly enhanced at 24 hours, but less significant at 72 hours after irradiation. The present data suggest that the radiosensitivity of brain capillary endothelial cells may be somewhat lower than that of endothelial cells originated from larger vessels, and that radiation induced morphological and functional changes in the brain capillary endothelial cells may be quantitatively similar to the changes in endothelial cells of larger vessels.",Included
720,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury. Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it.",Included
725,"Ionizing radiation induces structural and functional damage on the molecules of rat brain homogenate membranes: a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study. Humans can be exposed to ionizing radiation, due to various reasons, whose structural effects on biological membranes are not well defined. The current study aims to understand the ionizing radiation-induced structural and functional alterations in biomolecules of brain membranes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using rat animal models. For this purpose, 1000 cGy of ionizing radiation was specifically directed to the head of Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were decapitated after 24 h. The results revealed that the lipid-to-protein ratio decreased and that irradiation caused lipid peroxidation and increases in the amounts of olefinic =CH, carbonyl, and methylene groups of lipids. In addition, ionizing radiation induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, disordering of membrane lipids, strengthening of the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate groups of lipid head-groups, and weakening in the hydrogen bonding of the interfacial carbonyl groups of lipids. Radiation further caused significant decrements in the alpha-helix and turns, and significant increments in the beta-sheet and random coil contents in the protein structure. Hierarchical cluster analyses, performed in the whole region (3030-1000 cm(-1)), lipid (3030-2800 cm(-1)), and protein (1700-1600 cm(-1)) regions separately, successfully differentiated the control and irradiated groups of rat brain membranes and showed that proteins in the membranes are affected more than lipids from the damages induced with ionizing radiation. As a result, the current study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy can be used successfully as a novel method to monitor radiation-induced alterations on biological membranes.",Included

The authors carried out studies on 267 male rats and examined the effect of ionizing irradation (single irradation with 737 roentgens) on the duration of swimming and on the alteration of this effect by psychic stimulators caffeine and methylphenidate, administered in overthreshold doses (30 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for caffeine and 5 and 10 mg/kg of body weight for methylphenidate). On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced. The cyclic AMP is presumed to have some protective effect against ionizing irradiation.",Included

775,"Radiation Induces Distinct Changes in Defined Subpopulations of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells in the Adult Hippocampus. While irradiation can effectively treat brain tumors, this therapy also causes cognitive impairments, some of which may stem from the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. To study how radiation affects neurogenesis, we combine phenotyping of subpopulations of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells with double- and triple S-phase labeling paradigms. Using this approach, we reveal new features of division, survival, and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells after exposure to gamma radiation. We show that dividing neural stem cells, while susceptible to damage induced by gamma rays, are less vulnerable than their rapidly amplifying progeny. We also show that dividing stem and progenitor cells that survive irradiation are suppressed in their ability to replicate 0.5-1 day after the radiation exposure. Suppression of division is also observed for cells that entered the cell cycle after irradiation or were not in the S phase at the time of exposure. Determining the longer term effects of irradiation, we found that 2 months after exposure, radiation-induced suppression of division is partially relieved for both stem and progenitor cells, without evidence for compensatory symmetric divisions as a means to restore the normal level of neurogenesis. By that time, most mature young neurons, born 2-4 weeks after the irradiation, still bear the consequences of radiation exposure, unlike younger neurons undergoing early stages of differentiation without overt signs of deficient maturation. Later, 6 months after an exposure to 5 Gy, cell proliferation and neurogenesis are further impaired, though neural stem cells are still available in the niche, and their pool is preserved. Our results indicate that various subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus have different susceptibility to gamma radiation, and that neurogenesis, even after a temporary restoration, is impaired in the long term after exposure to gamma rays. Our study provides a framework for investigating critical issues of neural stem cell maintenance, aging, interaction with their microenvironment, and post-irradiation therapy.",Included

795,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research.",Included

The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included
809,"Acquisition of radioresistance by IL-6 treatment is caused by suppression of oxidative stress derived from mitochondria after gamma-irradiation. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and is one of the radiation-induced bystander factors. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of acquisition of radioresistance through the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by IL-6. We used a rat glioma cell line (C6) as tumor cells and a rat astrocyte cell line (RNB) as non-tumor cells. Our results showed that the surviving fraction of C6 cells after 6 Gy irradiation was increased by the addition of IL-6, but that this was not the case in RNB cells. In addition, the number of 53BP1 foci in C6 cells at 30 min after gamma-irradiation were decreased by IL-6. Levels of ROS in whole C6 cells, and superoxide in the mitochondria of C6 cells immediately after gamma-irradiation, were reduced by IL-6, but this was not observed in RNB cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 in C6 and RNB cells was inhibited by IL-6 alone. Therefore, it was concluded that IL-6 leads specifically to radioresistance in tumor cells by inhibition of increases in ROS after gamma-irradiation.",Included

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a devastating late complication of radiotherapy. However, research on the imaging performance of RION is not sufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) early after injury of the optic nerve of rhesus monkeys by a single-dose/fractionation-scheme of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intraorbital optic nerve contour of 5 rhesus monkeys was acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then, the unilateral intraorbital optic nerves of 5 rhesus monkeys were injured by gamma knife surgery (GKS) with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve). DTI was performed before the irradiation and 1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 24weeks after injury to obtain the cross-sectional area, and the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values.RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the injured optic nerve exhibited significant atrophy 24weeks after SRS. FA declined 1week after injury; this value then increased slightly but remained lower than before injury (P<0.05). AD began to decline in the 2weeks after injury and gradually disappeared (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: SRS with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve) on the unilateral intraorbital optic nerve can induce RION. DTI can detect RION at an early stage. FA and AD are useful indicators for RION diagnosis. In the early stage, the primary site of RION may be the vascular endothelium.",Included

PURPOSE: We developed a co-culture system to quantitate the growth and invasion of human malignant gliomas into a background of confluent normal human astrocytes, then used this assay to assess independently the effects of irradiating both cell types on glioma invasion.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled immortalized human astrocytes, human malignant glioma cells, or transformed human astrocytes were focally plated onto a confluent layer of normal human astrocytes, and the invasiveness of EGFP-labeled cells was scored after 96 h. To address the consequences of irradiation on glioma invasion, the invasiveness of irradiated glioma cell lines and irradiated astrocytic backgrounds was assessed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to quantitate the total number of EGFP-labeled cells.RESULTS: Growth in the co-culture assay consistently reflected transformation states of the plated cells. Immortalized, but untransformed human astrocytes failed even to establish growth on confluent normal human astrocytes. In contrast, all malignant human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes demonstrated various degrees of infiltration into the astrocytic bed. Irradiation failed to alter the invasiveness of U87, A172, and U373. A 1-Gy dose slightly reduced the invasiveness of U251 MG by 75% (p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Neuman-Keuls), without reducing total cell numbers. Independently irradiating the human astrocytic bed did not alter the invasiveness of nonirradiated U251, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 reduced U251 invasiveness in the co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: Growth in the co-culture assay reflects the transformation status and provides a useful in vitro model for assessing invasiveness. Human glioma invasiveness in the co-culture model responds variably to single low-dose fractions. MMP activity promotes invasiveness in the co-culture model. Reduced invasiveness in irradiated U251 appears to be mediated by MMP-independent mechanisms.",Included
856,"Increased hippocampal TrkA expression ameliorates cranial radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment and cognitive deficit via PI3K/AKT signaling. Cognitive deficit is one of the most serious complications of cranial radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of this cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) were investigated following whole-brain irradiation (WBI). Young male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent WBI at a single dose of 10 Gy. WBI was determined to result in notable memory decline and substantial neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus 3 months post-irradiation. Compared with the control group, TrkA protein expression was greater in irradiated rats 1 week after WBI, which then decreased significantly by the 3-month time-point. However, no difference in NGF expression was observed from 1 day to 3 months post-WBI. Overexpression of hippocampal TrkA in rats using adeno-associated virus ameliorated memory decline induced by irradiation. Additionally, upregulating TrkA expression rescued irradiation-induced hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and promoted neurogenesis. PI3K, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also revealed to be significantly inhibited by WBI, which was ameliorated by TrkA overexpression. Findings of the present study indicated that the TrkA-dependent signaling pathway may serve a critical role in radiotherapy-induced cognitive deficit and impairments in neurogenesis.",Included

Cranial irradiation is associated with long-term cognitive impairments, including deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4). Compared with epsilon3, epsilon4 increases the risk of cognitive impairments following various challenges while epsilon2 provides relative protection. Women are at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, particularly those carrying epsilon4. In previous experiments using male and female mice expressing human apoE-isoforms E2, E3 or E4 under the mouse apoE promoter, we showed that cranial irradiation with 137Cs (10 Gy) results in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments that are sex- and apoE-isoform dependent. 137Cs is a form of irradiation often used in the clinical setting.

Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated based on death rates of the Greek population. Duration of employment as a proxy for occupational exposure was used to stratify the cohort. Results. For cockpit crew, the overall SMR was 0.7 (n = 65, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9). The SMR for all cancers was also significantly decreased (n = 17; SMR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Most of this reduction was due to a large deficit in lung cancer deaths (SMR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). Slight but non-significant increases were noted for brain and liver cancer. The SMR for cardiovascular death was close to unity. Among female cabin attendants the SMR for all causes was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4-1.3). The SMR for all cancers was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-1.7). Mortality from breast cancer was not increased. Among male cabin crew, SMR for all causes was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Analyses according to duration of employment showed no pattern. Conclusions. In this first-ever occupational cohort study in Greece, Greek aircrew had a low overall and cancer mortality. Due to the small number of events, the strength of our study is limited. The Greek data will be included in a pooled analysis of European studies.",Included
880,"Analysis of primate head irradiation with 55-MeV protons. The distribution of the dose to the head of a primate phantom due to 55-MeV proton irradiation was calculated using a clinical radiotherapy treatment planning system, with anatomic definition through computerized tomography scans. Dose profiles, isodose distributions, and differential and integral dose-volume histograms are used to describe the probable proton dose to the brain of rhesus monkeys, irradiated over two decades ago, in which brain tumors have now developed. The dose analysis shows that 59% of the brain received a dose in excess of the reference surface dose, and that portions of the brain received doses greater than 300% of the reference surface dose. The regions of high dose are illustrated in isodose distributions. This information may be useful in evaluating potential tumor induction following radiation exposure.",Included

891,"Standard radiotherapy for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma results in progressive tract-specific brain white matter alterations: A one-year follow-up via diffusion tensor imaging. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT)-induced neurocognitive disability may be mediated by brain tissue damage. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of standard RT on normal brain tissue via in vivo neuroimaging in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 146 newly diagnosed NPC patients who were treated with standard RT were longitudinally followed up at multiple time points during the first year post-RT, with 19 comparable healthy controls followed up in parallel serving as normal age-related benchmarks. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate longitudinal brain white matter tract changes in NPC patients. The relationships between RT-related white matter changes, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment were also assessed.RESULTS: Bilateral cingulate angular bundle (CAB) fibers had progressive diffusion reduction [radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity] over time (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in NPC patients during the first year after RT. RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with longitudinal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus (P = 0.033). Additionally, RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with progressive cognitive impairment in NPC patients post-RT (P = 0.048).CONCLUSION: We present evidence of progressive RT-associated changes in the bilateral CAB in NPC patients, which may underlie RT-related cognitive impairment. These findings illustrate that the use of white matter tract alterations as potential biomarkers to detect RT-related brain injury in NPC patients may be useful for better understanding the pathogenesis of RT-induced cognitive decline.",Included
900,"Resveratrol restores erectile function in irradiated rats: Role on SIRT-1 and nNOS protein expressions. INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RVT), a well-known antioxidant agent, on oxidative parameters and erectile function in a rat model of pelvic irradiation. MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

The effects of supplementation with selenous yeast and ionizing radiation on selenium (Se) content and distribution were evaluated in rat tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, heart, muscle, blood, front brain, hind brain, hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal glands, testes, and hair). This study had 16 Se-supplemented (0.5 micrograms Se/d) and 16 placebo adult male Wistar rats. One half of the animals (eight Se-supplemented and eight placebos) were irradiated with a single dose of 4.2 Gy from a Co-60 source and sacrificed 7 d after irradiation along with nonirradiated animals and analyzed for Se content determination. The data obtained showed that selenous yeast supplementation increased Se levels in rat tissues (highest increases in hypothalamus, 161%; hind brain, 126%; spleen, 110%; and adrenal gland, 105%). Ionizing radiation induced significant changes in Se content and distribution (decrease in liver, blood, hair, femoral muscle, spleen, and hypothalamus; increase in kidney, testes, adrenal glands, and brain of placebo group). Supplementation with selenous yeast reduces changes in Se content and distribution after irradiation. It seems that the animal tissue susceptibility to oxidative damage may be correlated to their ability to retain Se in tissues.",Included
946,"Age dependence of the radiosensitivity of glial progenitors for In vivo fission-neutron and X irradiation. O-2A progenitor cells are the stem cells of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. In the epithermal reactor beams used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for treatment of brain tumors, fission neutrons are a contaminating component. To estimate the radiosensitivity of the O-2A progenitors for fission neutrons, an in vivo-in vitro clonogenic assay was used. Radiosensitivity of progenitors obtained from the spinal cord of 1- or 5-day-old rats or the optic nerve of 2- or 12-week-old rats for 1 MeV fission neutrons was compared to that for 300 kVp X rays. Dose-survival curves were fitted according to the linear-quadratic model. The resulting beta component was very small to negligible. Progenitor cells obtained from rats of different ages show differences in radiosensitivity, characterized by different alpha values. RBE values for fission neutrons were 3.5 for 1-day-old spinal cord, 3.2 for 5-day-old spinal cord, 3.0 for 2-week-old optic nerve, and 4.3 for 12-week-old optic nerve. These high RBE values indicate the importance of minimizing the fast-neutron component in the epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT.",Included

Background: Brain irradiation (BI) in humans may cause behavioral changes, cognitive impairment and neuroendocrine dysfunction. The effect of BI on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is not fully understood. Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of BI on HPA axis responses under basal and stressful conditions as well as following pretreatment with dexamethasone (Dex). Method(s): Adult male rats were exposed to whole BI. HPA axis responses were examined at 2, 4, 9 and 20 weeks after BI. Histological evaluations of the irradiated rats and matched controls were conducted at 4 and 20 weeks after BI. Result(s): In contrast to the control group, the basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels were enhanced at 9 and 20 weeks after BI and the inhibitory effect of Dex was reduced. BI also caused hyposuppression of the adrenocortical response to stress. Histological assessment of the irradiated brains revealed hippocampal atrophy at 20 weeks after BI. The neuronal counts were lower only in the CA1 region of the irradiated brains. BI caused a decrease in the binding capacity of Dex to the hippocampal cytosolic fraction. Conclusion(s): Enhanced stress-induced HPA axis responses and the reduced effect of Dex suggest that BI has delayed effects on HPA axis responses as manifested by impairment of the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids (GCs). The mechanisms underlying these effects of BI are unknown. It is possible that the marked BI-induced damage in the hippocampus, which plays an important role in the regulation of the feedback effect of GCs, may cause abnormal HPA axis responses following BI. © 2012 S.

978,"Endothelial apoptosis initiates acute blood-brain barrier disruption after ionizing radiation. Acute disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well recognized after radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed the genetic regulation of acute BBB disruption and its relationship to vascular endothelial cell death in the CNS after irradiation. Adult rats were given graded single doses of X-ray to the cervical spinal cord. At different time intervals after irradiation, the irradiated spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier was assessed using albumin immunohistochemistry, i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. In the rat spinal cord, there was a dose-dependent apoptotic response during the first 24 h after irradiation, and apoptotic cells consisted of both endothelial and glial cells, as described previously (1, 2). A dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell density was observed at 24 h after irradiation. This was associated with a similar dose-dependent disruption in blood-spinal cord barrier as demonstrated by albumin immunohistochemistry. Radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells has been shown to be dependent on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. After a single 50-Gy dose to the cervical spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was a 47.7% reduction in endothelial cell density at 24 h compared with nonirradiated controls. No decrease in endothelial cell density was observed in irradiated ASMase -/- mice. In the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was evidence of albumin immunoreactivity and Evans blue dye staining around microvessels, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake increased at 24 h. Nonirradiated controls and the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase -/- mice demonstrated no evidence of leakage. We conclude that apoptosis of endothelial cells initiates acute BBB disruption in the CNS after irradiation and that acute BBB disruption after irradiation is mediated by the ASMase pathway.",Included

Psychometric examinations, neurocognitive assessments, computerized electroencephalography, and cerebral vascular Doppler were used. Result(s): ""Radiation"" PTSD includes: ""flashforward"" phenomenon and anticipating stress (projection of fear and danger to the future); somatoform disorders, depression, trait and state anxiety; neurocognitive deficit (impaired memory and attention, auditory-verbal memory and learning, proactive and retroactive interference; cerebellar and stem symptoms, intellectual changes). The intima-media component thickness of common carotid arteries, and common and left internal carotid arteries stenosis rates are increased in the liquidators. Changes of bioelectrical brain activity as a decrease of beta- and theta-power together with an increase of alpha-power were found in the Chernobyl accident survivors with PTSD.

1041,"Central infusion of the melanocortin receptor antagonist agouti-related peptide (AgRP(83-132)) prevents cachexia-related symptoms induced by radiation and colon-26 tumors in mice. Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1050,"The contribution of DNA and chromosome repair deficiencies to the radiosensitivity of ataxia-telangiectasia. Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype.",Included

PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in patients irradiated for head and neck tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of ischemic stroke was determined in 367 patients with head and neck tumors (162 larynx carcinomas, 114 pleomorphic adenomas, and 91 parotid carcinomas) who had been treated with local radiotherapy (RT) at an age younger than 60 years. Relative risk (RR) of ischemic stroke was determined by comparison with population rates from a stroke-incidence register, adjusted for sex and age. Other risk factors for stroke (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus [DM]) were registered. The median follow-up time after RT was 7.7 years (3,011 person-years of follow-up).RESULTS: Fourteen cases of stroke occurred (expected, 2.5; RR, 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 9.4): eight in patients with laryngeal carcinoma (expected,1.56; RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.1), four in pleomorphic adenoma patients (expected, 0.71; RR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.5), and two in parotid carcinoma patients (expected, 0.24; RR, 8.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 30.6). Five of six strokes in patients irradiated for a parotid tumor occurred at the ipsilateral side. Analysis of other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease showed hypertension and DM to cause an increase of the RR after RT. After more than 10 years' follow-up, the RR was 10.1 (95% CI, 4.4 to 20.0). The 15-year cumulative risk of stroke after RT on the neck was 12.0% (95% CI, 6.5% to 21.4%).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an increased risk of stroke after RT on the neck. During medical follow-up, preventive measures should be taken to reduce the impact of the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, to decrease stroke in these patients.",Included

The heavy ion component of the cosmic radiation remains problematic to the assessment of risk in manned space flight. The biological effectiveness of HZE particles has yet to be established, particularly with regard to nervous tissue. Using heavy ions accelerated at the AGS of Brookhaven National Laboratory, we study the neurotoxic effects of iron particles. We exposed retinal explants, taken from chick embryos, to determine the dose response relationships for neurite outgrowth. Morphometric techniques were used to evaluate the in vitro effects of 1 GeV/a iron particles (LET 148 keV/micrometer). Iron particles produced a dose-dependent reduction of neurite outgrowth with a maximal effect achieved with a dose of 100 cGy. Doses as low as 10-50 cGy were able to induce reductions of the neurite outgrowth as compared to the control group. Neurite generation is a more sensitive parameter than neurite elongation, suggesting different mechanism of radiation damage in our model. These results showed that low doses/fluences of iron particles could impair the retinal ganglion cells' capacity to generate neurites indicating the highly neurotoxic capability of this heavy charged particle.",Included

Possible cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from various sources. Early transcriptional response in murine brain to low-dose X-rays (100 mGy) has been reported, suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. To investigate acute and late transcriptional, pathological and cognitive consequences of low-dose radiation, we applied an acute dose of 100-mGy total body irradiation (TBI) with X-rays to C57BL/6J Jms mice. We collected hippocampi and analyzed expression of 84 AD-related genes. Mouse learning ability and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test. We performed in vivo PET scans with (11)C-PIB, a radiolabeled ligand for amyloid imaging, to detect fibrillary amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation, and examined characteristic AD pathologies with immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein (APP), Abeta, tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). mRNA studies showed significant downregulation of only two of 84 AD-related genes, Apbb1 and Lrp1, at 4 h after irradiation, and of only one gene, Il1alpha, at 1 year after irradiation. Spatial learning ability and memory were not significantly affected at 1 or 2 years after irradiation. No induction of amyloid fibrillogenesis or changes in APP, Abeta, tau, or p-tau expression was detected at 4 months or 2 years after irradiation.

The safety of space flight is challenged by a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that may compromise the health and performance of astronauts. The molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy and decreased performance have been studied mostly after short duration flights and are still not fully elucidated. By deciphering the muscle proteome changes elicited in mice after a full month aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, we observed that the antigravity soleus incurred the greatest changes compared with locomotor muscles. Proteomics data notably suggested mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic and fiber type switching toward glycolytic type II fibers, structural alterations, and calcium signaling-related defects to be the main causes for decreased muscle performance in flown mice. Alterations of the protein balance, mTOR pathway, myogenesis, and apoptosis were expected to contribute to muscle atrophy. Moreover, several signs reflecting alteration of telomere maintenance, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance were found as possible additional deleterious effects. Finally, 8 days of recovery post flight were not sufficient to restore completely flight-induced changes. Thus in-depth proteomics analysis unraveled the complex and multifactorial remodeling of skeletal muscle structure and function during long-term space flight, which should help define combined sets of countermeasures before, during, and after the flight.",Included

OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (>=70 years of age) from a pooled analysis of four prospective trials.MATERIALS & METHODS: One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis.

Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma. We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after these palliative treatments. Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent (n=108) or single dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101). We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific (dysphagia score, European Organisation for Reasearch and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) OES-23, visual analogue pain scale) and generic (EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnarie (QLQ-C30), Euroqol (EQ)-5D) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse. We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P<0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up. Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups, general pain levels increased to a minor extent. The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer. Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales, since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The pathogenesis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is poorly understood and precursor cells are not known. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development. The findings provide insight into the tumorigenesis of de novo GBMs and suggest a new strategy for treatment of these lethal tumors by targeting both inactivation of N-CoR and inhibition of EGFR.",Included
1167,"The source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the goldfish: a differential irradiation protocol. We have used a partial irradiation paradigm to examine the provenance of cells that participate in Wallerian cellular responses in the goldfish visual system. Animals which received 50 Gy whole-body gamma-irradiation showed virtually complete inhibition of the proliferative burst usually seen after optic nerve section. These animals did, however, show a robust hyperplastic response in the optic tract that we believe represents the migration of nearby microglial cells into the affected tract. When only the postcephalic body was irradiated, proliferating cells in the major hematopoietic organs of the fish, the kidney and pronephros, were substantially inhibited. Despite this, the Wallerian cellular response in the visual paths was essentially normal. Thus, there is no obligate requirement for peripheral proliferative cells to participate in central Wallerian degeneration in the fish. However, when only the head was irradiated, and the hematopoietic organs were spared, there was a proliferative response in the visual system. We believe this represents the invasion of the visual pathways by peripheral blood cells through the optic nerve lesion and blood vessels in the nerve itself. This invasion, however, is not sufficient to generate substantial hyperplasia. In summary, although we find evidence for a small contribution by exogenous cells, the major source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the fish is the endogenous microglia. Our data underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanisms by which microglial cells are activated and the role that they play in regeneration.",Included
1168,"Boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors: functional and neuropathologic effects of blood-brain barrier disruption and intracarotid injection of sodium borocaptate and boronophenylalanine. Sodium borocaptate (BSH) and boronophenylalanine (BPA) are two drugs that have been used clinically for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) of brain tumors. We previously have reported that hyperosmotic mannitol-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-D), followed by intracarotid (i.c.) administration of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, significantly enhanced tumor boron delivery and the efficacy of BNCT in F98 glioma bearing rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine the short-term neuropathologic consequences of this treatment and the long-term effects on motor and cognitive function, as well as the neuropathologic sequelae 1 year following neutron capture irradiation. BBB-D was carried out in non-tumor bearing Fischer rats by infusing a 25% solution of mannitol i.c. followed by i.c. injection of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, immediately thereafter. Animals were euthanized 2 days after compound administration, and their brains were processed for neuropathologic examination, which revealed sporadic, mild, focal neuronal degeneration, hemorrhage, and necrosis. To assess the long-term effects of such treatment followed by neutron capture irradiation, non-tumor bearing rats were subjected to BBB-D after which they were injected i.c. with BPA (25 mg B/kg body weight (b.w)) or BSH (30 mg B/kg b.w.) either individually or in combination (BPA 12.5 mg and BSH 14 mg B/kg b.w.). Two and a half hours later they were irradiated at the Medical Research Reactor, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, with the same physical radiation doses (5.79, 8.10 or 10.06 Gy), delivered to the brain, as those that previously had been used for our therapy experiments. The animals tolerated this procedure well, after which they were returned to Columbus, Ohio where their clinical status was monitored weekly. After 1 year, motor function was assessed using a sensitive and reliable locomotor rating scale for open field testing in rats and cognitive function was evaluated by their performance in the Morris water maze, the results of which were similar to those obtained with age matched controls. After functional evaluation, the rats were euthanized, their brains were removed, and then processed for neuropathologic examination. Subtle histopathologic changes were seen in the choroid plexuses of irradiated animals that had received BPA, BSH or saline. Radiation related ocular changes consisting of keratitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and cataract formation were seen with similar frequency in most rats in each treatment group. Based on these observations, and the previously reported significant therapeutic gain associated with BBB-D and i.c. injection of BSH and BPA, the present observations establish its safety in rats and suggest that further studies in large animals and humans are warranted.",Included

The accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract plays a central role in the pathology of human Huntington's disease. We found that the huntingtin gene contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and p53 binds to these elements both in vivo and in vitro. p53 activation in cultured human cells, either by a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein or by gamma-irradiation (gamma-irradiation), increases huntingtin mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, murine huntingtin also contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and its expression is induced by p53 activation in cultured cells. Moreover, gamma-irradiation, which activates p53, increases huntingtin gene expression in the striatum and cortex of mouse brain, the major pathological sites for Huntington's disease, in p53+/+ but not the isogenic p53-/- mice. These results demonstrate that p53 protein can regulate huntingtin expression at transcriptional level, and suggest that a p53 stress response could be a modulator of the process of Huntington's disease.",Included

1290,"Effects of Amifostine Pre-treatment on MIRNA, LNCRNA, and MRNA Profiles in the Hypothalamus of Mice Exposed to 60Co Gamma Radiation. There is increasing evidence that the expression of non-coding RNA and mRNA (messenger RNA) is significantly altered following high-dose ionizing radiation (IR), and their expression may play a critical role in cellular responses to IR. However, the role of non-coding RNA and mRNA in radiation protection, especially in the nervous system, remains unknown. In this study, microarray profiles were used to determine microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of mice that were pretreated with amifostine and subsequently exposed to high-dose IR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. We found that fewer miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were induced by amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice, which exhibited antagonistic effects compared to IR, indicating that amifostine attenuated the IR-induced effects on RNA profiles. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed changes in a variety of signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses during radioprotection following amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice. Taken together, our study revealed that amifostine treatment altered or attenuated miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of exposed mice.

1307,"Pions and pig skin: preclinical evaluation of RBE for early and late damage. The skin of 50 pigs has been irradiated with negative pi mesons and with X rays in order to determine the RBE for early epidermal and later dermal damage. Late fibrosis was not studied. Four, 7, 9 and 10 fractions were used. An estimate of the RBE was made from the reactions on each pig for both early and late damage so that interanimal variability would be avoided. The data were also averaged to obtain mean dose response curves. There was no tendency for higher RBE's for late than for early skin damage. These pig studies have demonstrated an RBE of about 1.5 for early epidermal reactions and a slightly lower RBE (approximately 1.4) for later dermal damage in the same animals. This indicates that at doses of about 2.0 to 3.5 Gy pions, the medium wave skin damage is unlikely to be more severe than would be predicted from the early skin reactions and the accumulated clinical experience with X rays. However, if the trend to a steeper slope for the RBE versus dose per fraction for late injury is correct, as indicated by other published studies a relative increase in the late injury might be expected if much lower doses per fraction are used.

1331,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus. The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included

Evidence derived from both clinical and experimental investigations has suggested an influence of ionizing radiation on focal epileptogenicity. To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala. The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes. Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala, after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation. The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated (60)Co source (1.25 MeV). Generalized seizure thresholds were then redetermined at weekly intervals for 10 weeks and at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months. We observed no significant changes in seizure threshold during the postirradiation interval; however, we did observe persistent changes in seizure dynamics manifesting within the first week postirradiation. These consisted of an increased tendency for seizure activity to propagate into brain stem circuits during the primary ictus (i.e., ""running fits"") and an increased tendency for secondary convulsions to emerge postictally. These effects involving seizure dynamics have not been reported previously and appear to represent a radiation-induced disinhibition of one or more neural circuits. The disparity between these effects and earlier reports of seizure-suppressive effects resulting from analogous radiation exposures is discussed in relation to kindling and status epilepticus-induced pathogenesis within the hippocampus.",Included

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque.

Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT <inf>non-RE</inf> (n = 21) and post-RT <inf>REproved</inf><inf>infollow-up</inf> (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Kang, Zeng, Li, Gao, Liu, Shi and Liao.",Included

Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included

We calculated the LTR of stroke for various BP-based groups among 7847 subjects who had not been diagnosed with stroke before the index age of 55 years using cumulative incidence analysis adjusting for competing risks. By 2003, 868 subjects had suffered stroke (512 (58.9%) were women and 542 (62.4%) experienced ischemic stroke). BP was a significant factor in determining risk of stroke for men and women, with distributions of cumulative risk for stroke significantly different across BP groups. The LTR of all-stroke for normotension (systolic BP/diastolic BP < 120/80 mm Hg), prehypertension (120-139/80-89 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (140-159/90-99 mm Hg) and stage 2 hypertension (> 160/100 mm Hg) were 13.8-16.9-25.8-25.8% in men and 16.0-19.9-24.0-30.5% in women, respectively (P < 0.001 among BP groups in both sexes).

1451,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence?. Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included

PURPOSE: In this article, we investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the initiation of acute damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain tissue following radiotherapy (RT) for CNS tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy and a closed cranial window technique were used to measure quantitatively BBB permeability to FITC-dextran 4.4-kDa molecules, leukocyte adhesion (Rhodamine-6G) and vessel diameters before and after 20-Gy cranial radiation with and without treatment with anti-TNF. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify astrogliosis post-RT and immunofluorescence was used to visualize protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 post-RT. Recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to elucidate the role of TNF in leukocyte adhesion and vessel diameter.RESULTS: Mice treated with anti-TNF showed significantly lower permeability and leukocyte adhesion at 24 and 48 h post-RT vs. RT-only animals. We observed a significant decrease in arteriole diameters at 48 h post-RT that was inhibited in TNF-treated animals. We also saw a significant increase in activated astrocytes following RT that was significantly lower in the anti-TNF-treated group. In addition, immunofluorescence showed protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 in the cerebral cortex that was inhibited with anti-TNF treatment. Finally, administration of rTNF induced a decrease in arteriole diameter and a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in venules and arterioles.CONCLUSIONS: TNF plays a significant role in acute changes in BBB permeability, leukocyte adhesion, arteriole diameter, and astrocyte activation following cranial radiation. Treatment with anti-TNF protects the brain's microvascular network from the acute damage following RT.",Included

The significance of irradiated normal brain volume in glioma recurrence is usually ignored by radiotherapists. The whole-brain irradiation (WBI) of 15 Gy in three fractions was delivered to C57BL/6 mice before implantation of GL261 glioma cells. The changes in vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) after WBI were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell invasion assays were performed to study the effects of VEGF and SDF-1alpha. The levels of VEGF and SDF-1alpha in normal brain tissues increased after 15 Gy WBI. The WBI before tumor implantation significantly increased the invasive ability of GL261 cells. VEGF and SDF-1alpha could promote invasion of GL261 cells even after high-dose irradiation. The combination of irradiation and inhibitors such as AMD3100 may prevent irradiation-stimulated dissemination of glioma cells.,Included

The aim of this study was to assess the potential of gastrointestinal peptide plasma levels as biomarkers of radiation-induced digestive tract damage. To this end, plasma levels of substance P, GRP, motilin, PYY, somatostatin-28, gastrin, and neurotensin were followed for up to 5 days in pigs after a 16-Gy whole-body X-irradiation, completed by a histopathological study performed at 5 days. Each peptide gave a specific response to irradiation. The plasma levels of GRP and substance P were not modified by irradiation exposure; neither were those of motilin and PYY. Concerning gastrin, a 2-3-fold increase of plasma concentration was observed in pig, which presented the most important histological alterations of the stomach. The plasma levels of somatostatin, unchanged from 1 to 4 days after irradiation, was also increased by 130% at 5 days. In contrast, a diminution of neurotensin plasma levels was noted, firstly at 1 day (-88%), and from 3 days after exposure (-50%). The present study suggested that changes in gastrin and neurotensin plasma levels were associated with structural alterations of the stomach and ileum, respectively, indicating that they may be relevant biological indicators of radiation-induced digestive damage to these segments.",Included

1518,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy. Purpose/Objective(s): In our previous study, we have found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis shortly after radiation. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of minocycline on neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis. Purpose/Objective(s): The immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cell line was used. The protective effect of minocycline on X-irradiated HT22 cells was demonstrated using clonogenic assay and apoptosis analysis. The underlying mechanisms were explored by using methods such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, shRNA knockdown, Western blot et al. Result(s): We found that minocycline protected HT22 hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced cell death, manifest as increased clonogenic cell survival and decreased apoptosis in irradiated cells. This protective effect of minocycline might involve cell cycle perturbation after radiation, but not DNA damage and repair. Further investigation showed that X-irradiation activated AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy, and minocycline significantly enhanced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of minocycline might not be involved in the enhancing effect of minocycline on radiation-induced autophagy, but it might at least partially contribute to the inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced apoptosis. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis mainly through targeting radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

This paper evaluates the hearing status in the long-term, of patients who have had radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and also discusses the hearing losses from a disability point of view, which takes into account binaural hearing. Forty patients who have had NPC successfully treated by a single radical course of radiotherapy of 70-80 Gy were studied at 2-12 years (mean 6.2 years) after radiotherapy. Each patient was examined clinically and with a pure-tone audiogram. Averaged hearing thresholds over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz were evaluated and a value > 30 dB was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with age-matched controls. The median hearing threshold for each ear in NPC patients was found to be 31.9 dB (range 10.0-86.3 dB) and that for controls 17.5 dB (7.5-38.8 dB) (P < 0.0005, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test). In NPC patients, 44 ears (55.0%) had abnormal hearing, of which 17 (21.3%), 5 (6.3%) and 22 (27.5%) ears had predominantly sensori-neural, conductive and mixed hearing losses, respectively. Nineteen ears had middle ear effusions, accounting for the majority of mixed and conductive hearing losses. In terms of individual patients, 8 (20.0%) and 18 (45.0%) patients had abnormal hearing in one year (monaural hearing disability) and both ears (binaural hearing disability), respectively. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients who have had radiotherapy for NPC, have hearing disability in the long-term, as compared to normal controls.",Included

Environmental epigenetics is the study of how exposures interact with the epigenome to cause stable epigenetic change, most notably changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here we asked whether the response of the mouse epigenome to ionizing radiation is specific or non-specific. We used meDIP-seq to examine radiation-induced changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) throughout the genome. To examine tissue specificity, we compared the methylomes of heart and brain tissue 22 weeks after exposure to protons. We found 5mC and 5hmC changes that mapped to genes with cardiovascular functions in the heart and with neuronal functions in the brain. We also compared two forms of ionizing radiation, the sparsely ionizing protons and densely ionizing 56Fe ions. Both are components of galactic cosmic radiation, which is a concern for astronauts flying deep space missions. Specifically, we asked whether protons and 56Fe ions would produce similar DNA methylation changes in the brain at 4 weeks post exposure, and found significant overlap for both 5mC and 5hmC changes. Interestingly, gene expression changes in the brain at 4 weeks were linked to changes in 5hmC at promoter regions, but not 5mC, and these linked changes mapped to neuronal ontology pathways. Further, a novel form of 5hmC change along gene bodies was observed and mapped mostly to postsynaptic pathways. Finally, the extent of 56Fe ion-induced behavioral change correlated inversely with DNA methylation change suggesting that the epigenomic response to radiation was part of the repair process to mitigate its toxic effects.",Included

OBJECTIVE To explore the effect and mechanisms of LW-AFC, a new formula derived from Liu Wei Di Huang Tang, on irradiation-induced reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n=10): control group, LW-AFC group (1.6 g?kg<sup>-1</sup>), Liu Wei Di Huang Tang (LW) group (10 g-kg<sup>-1</sup>), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) group, irradiation group, irradiation+ LW group, and irradiation + LW-AFC group. Reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis was induced by cranial irradiation. LW-AFC was administered by oral gavage for 30 d after cranial irradiation treatment. Immunofluorescence and Nissl's staining were performed for histological morphology assessment. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was used in the detection of proliferation cells. The peripheral blood and hippocampal homogenate were collected to measure the content of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-y), interleukin-1 (3 (IL-1(3), IL-4 and IL-10. The hippocampal homogenate was used for Western blot to detect the BDNFkappaB signal pathway, including extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and BDNF target protein. Morris water maze and new object recognition test were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. The mice forced swimming and tail suspension test were used to assess alteration in depressive behavior. Long term potentiation was used to examine the synaptic plasticity change of mice. RESULTS Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced after irradiation of 20 Gray dose (10 Gray per day, total 2 d). LW-AFC treatment increased the BrdU number of irradiated mice (P<0.05). In Morris water maze test, LW-AFC group showed decreased escape latency in the learning period (P<0.05), while increased the number of crossing the platform in the memory period. LW-AFC can also reduce the immobility time of mice in the tail suspension test (P<0.01). CONCLUSION LW-AFC modulates adult neurogenesis to ameliorate cognitive impairment and reduce depressive behavior in radiation injury mice.",Included

1602,"Chronic Low Dose Neutron Exposure Results in Altered Neurotransmission Properties of the Hippocampus-Prefrontal Cortex Axis in Both Mice and Rats. The proposed deep space exploration to the moon and later to Mars will result in astronauts receiving significant chronic exposures to space radiation (SR). SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.",Included
1625,"The effects on basal anterior pituitary hormone concentrations by cranial irradiation in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Hypopituitarism occurring in patients who received external cranial radiation therapy (RT) have been increasingly recognized. Fourteen healthy patients were collected as control Group I, and 25 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were enrolled as Group II. Another 18 NPC patients were enrolled as Group III. Blood was sampled from Group I, Group IIB (before RT), Group IIA (one week after RT) and Group IIIA (1 to 1.5 years after RT). The basal samples were taken for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). The results showed the T3 level was statistically low in Group IIB compared with Group I. The serum GH and FSH (male only) levels were higher and with statistical significance in Group IIA compared Group IIB. Both GH and ACTH levels decreased and PRL increased with statistical significance in Group IIIA compared with Group IIA. The ACTH decreased with statistical significance in Group IIIA compared with Group IIB. Clinical damage to the pituitary is usually manifested months to years after RT.

1629,"Targeting of externalized alphaB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations. BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction.METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy).RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mug/mL.CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces. CRYAB provides a novel radiation marker for potential vascular targeting in irradiated brain AVMs.",Included
1631,"Regulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis after brain irradiation. PURPOSE: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels seen after radiation treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE2 production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE2 production and PGES expression.RESULTS: As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE2 levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE2 seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE2 production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.",Included

Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the early neurovascular alterations of the retina in radiation encephalopathy (RE) patients with normal-ranged visual acuity after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): Fifty-five RE patients and 54 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) of the included eye should not be more than 0. The vessel density and thickness of different locations in the retina were acquired automatically using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The data were then compared between the RE patients and the controls. The location included the whole retina, the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)/the ganglion cell complex (GCC), the deep vascular plexus (DVP), and the choroid in the macular area, as well as the inside disc and peripapillary area in the optic nerve head (ONH). The risk factors in OCTA retinal impairments were analyzed using a backward multiple linear regression. The relationships between mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in the visual field (VF) and the OCTA parameters were also analyzed in RE patients. Result(s): The vessel density of the GCC was significantly reduced in RE patients compared with controls (p = 0.018), and the reductions were mainly shown in the parafoveal (p = 0.049) and perifoveal fields (p = 0.006). The thickness of the GCC was correspondingly reduced (whole image GCC mean thickness: p = 0.044; parafoveal thickness: p = 0.038; perifoveal thickness: p = 0.038). In addition, the sub-foveal choroidal thickness (p = 0.039) was also reduced in RE patients. The vessel density of the GCC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.643) and DVP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.777) had a significant positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and had a significant negative correlation with age (GCC: HDL-C, beta = 29.89, p = 0.005; ApoA1, beta = 78.92, p = 0.002; age, beta = -0.886, p = 0.001; DVP: HDL-C, beta = 40.09, p = 0.003; ApoA1, beta = 62.65, p = 0.013; age, beta = -1.31, p = 0.001). The vessel density of the GCC also had a significant negative correlation with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (beta = -32.18, p = 0.006). In the VF, MD had a significant positive correlation with the vessel density inside disc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.241, beta = 0.304, p = 0.045), whereas PSD showed a significant negative correlation with the vessel density inside disc and the average GCC thickness, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437; vessel density inside disc, beta = -0.358, p = 0.004; average GCC thickness, beta = -0.510, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): With the aid of OCTA, we found that neurovascular alterations of the retina may exist in RE patients with normal-ranged visual acuity. Herein, we suggest the implementation of OCTA to assist ophthalmologists in the early detection and consistent monitoring of radiation-related eye diseases to avoid delayed diagnosis. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Zhan, Xiao and Lan.",Included

Whether this is due to their endocrine consequences (hypopituitarism), their underlying hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or both is still under debate. The aim of this trial was to measure quality of life (QoL) in long-term cancer survivors who have received a radiation dose to the basal part of the brain and the pituitary.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=101) treated for oropharyngeal or epipharyngeal cancer with radiotherapy followed free of cancer for a period of 4 to10 years were identified. Fifteen patients (median age 56 years) with no concomitant illness and no hypopituitarism after careful endocrine evaluation were included in a case-control study with matched healthy controls.

1653,"PIDD Mediates Radiation-Induced Microglia Activation. Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is the most common adverse effect that occurs after cranial radiation therapy (CRT). We have previously reported that CRT-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain tissues and inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus might be caused by microglial activation and may play an important role in RIBI. In this study we examined the role of p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD) in radiation-induced activation of BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotide control mRNA or antisense oligonucleotide-targeted PIDD mRNA and were sham or 16 Gy irradiated. The state of microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Findings from this study suggest that silencing PIDD expression could inhibit microglial activation by downregulating the PIDD-C/NF-kappabeta transcription pathway. PIDD acts as a critical switcher between the NF-kappabeta transcription pathway and radiation-induced apoptosis. Given these findings, this study offers a potential novel approach to further combination treatment of RIBI.",Included

Mean age of the persons was 41. Vegetative dystonia syndrome was diagnosticated in 50% of examined subjects.

The conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerves, as well as the neuromuscular transmission were normal. No substantial changes in parameters of the soleus H- and M-responses were detected. A decreased amplitude and increased latency of the evoked skin sympathetic potential were found indicating a decreased tone of the adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstrictors and cholinergic sudomotor fibres, that may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the sensory, vegetotrophovascular disorders for these subjects. Decreased activity of the sympathetic autonomic system causes permanent course of the vegetative dystonia syndrome and more seldom the parasympathetic autonomic paroxysms. A decreased tone of the sympathetic autonomic system may be due to the monoaminergic neuromediation inhibition (decreased noradrenaline and dopamine excretion for the same subjects), that can induce psychoemotional disorders, depression and sleep-wakeness cycle disorders.",Included

Epidemiological studies in this occupational group have been conducted over the last 15-20 years, usually with a focus on radiation-associated cancer. These studies are summarised in this note. Overall cancer risk was not elevated in most studies and subpopulations analysed, while malignant melanoma, other skin cancers and breast cancer in female aircrew have shown elevated incidence, with lesser risk elevations in terms of mortality. In some studies, including the large German cohort, brain cancer risk appears elevated. Cardiovascular mortality risks were generally very low. Dose information for pilots was usually derived from calculation procedures based on routine licence information, types of aircraft and routes/hours flown, but not on direct measurements. However, dose estimates have shown high validity when compared with measured values. No clear-cut dose-response patterns pointing to a higher risk for those with higher cumulative doses were found.

It is suggested that scores of large vessel damage do relate to dose at 41 to 87 weeks, and can be used to quantify the vessel injury, and that fibrinoid necrosis of the large vessels may relate to the incidence of radionecrosis.",Included

Cytokines and growth factors are important regulatory proteins controlling the growth and differentiation of normal and malignant glial cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and origin of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the subacute brain injury after a single high-dose irradiation using 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. The right cerebral hemispheres of rats were exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays using Ir-192. The radiation effect was assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after irradiation, and the results were compared with those in sham operation group. Histological changes characteristic of radiation injury were correlated with the duration after the single dose irradiation. The loss of cortical thickness also increased with the lapse of time after irradiation. The TNF-alpha expression in the irradiated cerebral hemispheres was significantly increased compared with that in the sham operation group. TGF-beta 1 expression was also increased in the irradiated hemispheres. Immunohistochemical study revealed that TGF-beta 1 was expressed predominantly by infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes around the necrotic areas. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 may play prominent roles in the radiation injuries after a single high-dose irradiation.",Included
1757,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells. Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included

Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Edaravone is a potent free radical scavenger, which has been clinically used to treat the neuronal damage following acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose is to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone and to investigate the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in rat ovaries after radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups. 1: control group, 2: sham group (only radiation), 3: 450 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group, 4: 45 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed. Histologic changes under light microscopy and immunoreactivity for anticaspase-3 were noted and compared between the four groups. Result(s): There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts, vascular congestion, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and interstitial cell degeneration between the groups. Radiation causes deterioration of histopathological parameters. Administration of edaravone at different doses seems to reverse these alterations and alleviate the injury. Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be enhanced by edaravone. Conclusion(s): This is the first study evaluating the protective effects of edaravone on radiation-induced ovarian damage. Edaravone decreased the follicule apoptosis and attenuates ovarian damage induced radiation in rats.",Included

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for incident functional disability among long-term evacuees of Iitate village after Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster (GEJE). We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, both the group with low-participation in the exercise program and the group with high-participation in the exercise program had a significantly lower rate of incident functional disability compared to those who did not participate at all (HR = 0.27, CI: 0.16-0.46; HR = 0.30, CI: 0.12-0.74, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-disaster BCL domains were useful to identify individuals at risk of functional disability after a major socio-technical disaster. Therefore, this instrument can be used to identify at-risk older adults who would benefit from early exercise programs to prevent incident functional disability.",Included

Background: Central neurocytoma (CN) is a rare tumor accounting for <0.5% of all intracranial tumors. Surgery +/- radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment. This international multicentric study aims to evaluate the outcomes of CNs patients after multimodal therapies and identify predictive factors. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with CN treated between 2005 and 2019. Treatment characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Result(s): All patients with CN underwent surgical resection. Radiotherapy was delivered in 19 patients. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 50-60 Gy). The median follow-up time was 56 months. The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS were 90% and 76%, respectively. Patients who received radiotherapy had a significantly longer PFS than patients without RT (p = 0.004) and a trend towards longer OS. In addition, complete response after treatments was associated with longer PFS (p = 0.07). Conclusion(s): Using RT seems to be associated with longer survival rates with an acceptable toxicity profile. Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included

Micro-slit-beam radiation therapy (MRT) using synchrotron-generated X-ray beams allows for extremely high-dose irradiation. However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death. The valley doses, influenced by beam spacing and irradiated dose, could represent important survival factors for MRT.",Included
1904,"Thymoquinone reduces oxidative and nitrosative stress in tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Introduction: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side-effects during and following their treatment. Efforts to decrease toxicity of irradiation to normal tissue, organs and cells have led to a search for cytoprotective agent. Investigations for effective and non-toxic compounds with radioprotective capability led to increasing interest in antioxidant such as thymoquinone (TQ). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of TQ on oxidant/antioxidant systems in the tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of TQ administered by either orogastric tube or intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Result(s): Tongue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the control and sham control groups were significantly increased when compared to the irradiation (IR) group and IR plus TQ groups. Nitric oxide (NO*), peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, xantine oxidase (XO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities significantly increased in the IR group when compared to the control and sham control groups. Conclusion(s): Results show that TQ has the radioprotective, antioxidant effects and free radical scavenging activity. Therapy with antioxidants may lead to the increase in the antioxidant defense system and thus, may decrease the clinical symptoms in radiation therapy.",Included
1907,"The effect of immunosuppression by total-body irradiation on the pharmacodynamics of centrally active drugs in rats. The aim of this investigation was to assess whether immunosuppression induced by total-body irradiation (TBI) affects the pharmacodynamics of centrally acting drugs. Female Sabra rats were exposed to a single dose of gamma irradiation (5.3 Gy). Four days later, when both the cellular and the humoral immune responses were impaired, they received an i.v. infusion of either phenobarbital (0.8 mg/min), ethanol (16.3 mg/min), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 0.618 mg/min), or theophylline (as aminophylline; 2 mg/min). The infusion was stopped at the onset of the pharmacologic end point--loss of righting reflex for the depressant agents or maximal seizures for the stimulant drugs--and the concentrations of the neuroactive drugs at that point were determined. In the ethanol experiment, blood samples were also taken upon awakening. The radiation-induced immunosuppression significantly decreased the CNS sensitivity to the depressant action of both phenobarbital and ethanol as indicated by the higher CSF phenobarbital concentrations required to induce sleep in the irradiated rats versus controls (156 +/- 4 vs 133 +/- 5 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.05), and the higher serum ethanol concentrations at the onset and offset of sleep in the immunosuppressed group versus control values (4.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.68 +/- 0.01 vs 3.79 +/- 0.17 and 1.32 +/- 0.9 mg/mL, respectively; P < 0.04).

Small doses of radioactive irradiation were found to be associated with damage to all levels of the nervous system, as evidenced by cliniconeurological investigations. But regulatory functions and vascular system get it most of all. Commonly seen in the sample was vegetovascular dystonia, also revealed were a varying degree discirculatory encephalopathy, acute disturbances in cerebral circulation, dyscirculatory myelopathy. Vascular abnormalities may develop at any age but in young adulthood they tend to occur more frequently. Clinical manifestations of vegetovascular dystonia were characterized by profound mixed type vegetative crises. Even if treated, vegetovascular dystonia tends to acquire remittent-and-progredient course leading to decompensation very soon. Strokes run atypical course: hemorrhages occur more often than not; circulatory disorders come about against the background of normal arterial blood pressure or insignificant its fluctuations. Hemorrhage may run gradually progressing course, which fact makes their diagnosis very difficult even with modern techniques being involved in relevent studies. It is not infrequently that carotid angiography does not find any structural-and-morphologic changes in the main vessels. A separate nozologic form, viz. that of discirculatory encephalopacy due to radiative irradiation, is suggested, as an entity worth introducing into the medical nomenclature.",Included

The aim of this study was to determine the relation between changes in myelin basic protein (MBP) levels during the acute and subacute phases of central nervous system injury following whole-brain radiation and delayed demyelination in the radiation-injured brain tissue. Methods. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with single fractions of 2, 10, or 30 Gy of whole-brain radiation. The authors measured MBP gene expression and protein levels in the brain tissue by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 week and 1-3 months following irradiation to monitor myelin changes in the brain. Demyelination was determined with Luxol fast blue myelin staining and routine histopathological and electron microscopy examination of injured brain tissue. The changes in MBP levels in the different animal groups at specific time points were correlated with demyelination in corresponding dose groups. Results. At 1 month after applying the 10 and 30 Gy of radiation, MBP mRNA expression showed a transient but significant decrease, followed by recovery to baseline levels at 3 months after treatment. The MBP levels were decreased by only 70-75% at 1 month after 10 and 30 Gy of radiation. At 2-3 months after applying the higher dose of 30 Gy, however, the MBP levels continued to decline, and typical demyelination changes were observed with myelin staining and ultrastructural examination. Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that the early radiation-induced MBP changes between 1 and 3 months af ter single treatments of 10 and 30 Gy of radiation to the whole brain are indicative of permanent injury shown as de myelination of irradiated brain tissue.",Included
1922,"Transmission of signals between irradiated and non-irradiated organisms: Mechanisms and significance. Inter-animal signaling from irradiated to non-irradiated organisms has been demonstrated for whole body irradiated mice and also for fish. Endpoints studied include clastogenic damage, and reproductive cell death. For fish, proteomic data has also been produced showing the induction of a protective proteome in both medaka and rainbow trout. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",Included

PURPOSE: To investigate the profile of biochemical and physiological changes induced in the rat spinal cord by radiation, over a period of 8 months.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The thoraco-lumbar spinal cords of Fisher rats were irradiated to a dose of 15 Gy. The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system.",Included

PURPOSE: Investigation of the effects of hyperthermia on the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord with respect to: (a) incidence of paralysis, (b) latency, (c) histopathology, and (d) tumor induction.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Rat lumbosacral spinal cord with the cauda equina was single-dose irradiated with 15 to 32 Gy of x-rays. Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat. Second, latency for paralysis was shortened in the lower dose range. Third, no difference in pathology between x-rays alone or in combination with hyperthermia. Fourth, hyperthermia did increase radiation carcinogenesis.",Included

The effects of Tanshinone II(A) on radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction; the expression level of nuclear factor (NF-kappabeta) p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus was measured by Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy analysis were applied to detect the expression of gamma-H2AX and p65 postirradiation.RESULTS: Radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells was detectable after irradiation. Tanshinone II(A) decreased the radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines. Further, Western blotting showed that Tanshinone II(A) could attenuate the nuclear translocation of (NF-kappabeta) p65 submit postirradiation. Immunofluorescence staining showed gamma-H2AX foci formation with p65 translocation into the nucleus postirradiation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that Tanshinone II(A) exerts anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes that might be associated with the NF-kappabeta signaling pathway. It is postulated that irradiation causes immediate cellular reaction, and that double-strand breaks trigger the molecular response that leads to NF-kappabeta pathway activation.",Included

The radioprotective property of 50 mg/kg body weight jamun (Syzygium cumini) extract was studied in the cultured splenocytes of mice exposed to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 Gy of gamma-radiation. The spleens of irradiated mice were removed aseptically and the splenocytes were extracted from the individual spleens and cultured. The micronuclei were prepared 72 hours after irradiation in binucleate splenocytes by blocking cytokinesis with cytochalasin-B. Irradiation of mice resulted in a dose-dependent elevation in the micronucleated splenocytes. The exposure of mice not only elevated splenocytes bearing one micronucleus but also cells bearing 2 and multiple (>2) micronuclei indicating induction of complex DNA damage after irradiation. Oral treatment of mice with 50 mg/kg body weight of jamun leaf extract protected against the radiation-induced micronuclei formation. Jamun extract also protected against the formation of 2 and multiple micronuclei indicating repair or inhibition of complex DNA damage.

Studies in a cell free system revealed that jamun extract inhibited the formation of OH, O(2)-, DPPH, and ABTS(+) free radicals in a concentration dependent manner. Our study demonstrates that jamun extract protected mice against the radiation-induced DNA damage and inhibition of radiation-induced free radical formation may be one of the mechanisms of radioprotection.",Included

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Paralysis observed during a study of vertebral bone tolerance to single-session irradiation led to further study of the dose-related incidence of motor peripheral neuropathy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a bone tolerance study, cervical spinal nerves of 15 minipigs received bilateral irradiation to levels C5-C8 distributed into three dose groups with mean maximum spinal nerve doses of 16.9 +/- 0.3 Gy (n=5), 18.7 +/- 0.5 Gy (n=5), and 24.3 +/- 0.8 Gy (n=5). Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal. Irradiated spinal nerve regions showed increased thickness and hypointensity on MR imaging.CONCLUSION: The single-session tolerance dose of the cervical spinal nerves lies between 19.0 and 24.1 Gy for this model.",Included
2010,"The effect of sequential irradiation with X-rays and fast neutrons on the survival of V79 Chinese hamster cells. V79 Chinese hamster cells have been exposed to X-rays or fast neurons or to the two radiations given sequentially. Cells exposed to a priming dose of X-rays and then exposed immediately to a series of neutron doses regard the X-ray dose as equivalent to a neutron dose giving the same surviving fraction (iso-effective). If the cells are exposed to a neutron dose followed by X-rays the resulting survival is higher than would be obtained if the primary dose had been an iso-effective X-ray dose. However, it is lower than would be expected if the two radiations acted independently. The results imply that there is interaction between the damage caused by X-rays and fast neurons. If the two radiations are given 3 hours apart they act independently.",Included
2023,"Localization of glutathione and induction of glutathione synthesis-related proteins in mouse brain by low doses of gamma-rays. First, we determined the cerebral localization of reduced glutathione (GSH) in normal mice by means of autoradiography using 99mTc-meso-hexamethyl propylene oxime. A highly specific localization of GSH in the cerebellum and hippocampus was observed. Secondly, we measured the elevation of GSH level in the brain after low-dose gamma-irradiation. The cerebral GSH levels increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reaching a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, then remaining significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated control until 12 h and returning to the control level by 24 h. Thirdly, we examined the induction of the activities and the mRNAs of proteins involved in the synthesis and regeneration of GSH in the brain of mice subjected to low-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was significantly increased at 0.5 h, and remained high until 2 h post-irradiation (50 cGy). The level was transiently lowered to the non-irradiated control level at 3 h and slightly increased again after 6 h post-irradiation. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly increased 3 h after irradiation, and remained high up to 24 h post-irradiation. As for glutathione reductase, the mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h, and peaked strongly at 2 h, while the enzyme activity was significantly increased at 6 h after irradiation, and continued to increase up to 24 h. The level of mRNA for thioredoxin, which contributes to GSH biosynthesis by supplying cysteine to the de novo pathway, peaked between 0.5 h and 2 h post-irradiation, and rapidly declined thereafter. The content of thioredoxin showed a transient decrease immediately after irradiation, but was then remarkably elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 h, and thereafter declining sharply. These results indicate that the increase in endogenous GSH in mouse brain soon after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation is a consequence of the induction of GSH synthesis-related proteins and occurs via both the de novo synthesis and the regeneration pathways.",Included

2045,"Combined effect of irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. The accidents in atomic electric stations took place in many countries. The most severe catastrophe was happened in 1986 in Ukraine. The population in Chernobyl region is suffering both from the consequences of irradiation and polyvitamine deficiency. Can it be related with the increased alcohol consumption observed in that region? To test this hypotheses we have studied the influence of the thiamine and folate deficiency and low dose irradiation and their combination on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. 80 adult male rats waiting 140-180 g. were preliminary tested in the conditions of free choice between 10% ethanol and water (triple, during 2 days). Then they were divided into 4 groups (on 20 animals) equal on the alcohol consumption and preference. 2 weeks later they were treated by hidrochythiamine (vitamin B1 antagonist, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) and metotrexate (folic acid antagonist, 200 mg/kg, s.c.) weekly, three times. 2 days following the every administration the some animals were treated by the gamma-irradiation (Co60, 0.25 gray). The groups were: 1- control (isotonic solution of NaCl); 2- irradiation alone; 3- antivitamins; 4- antivitamins + irradiations. Next day following the last irradiation half of animals from every group were sacrificed and vitamins status in their tissues was studied. Others were tested during 14 days individually in situation of free choice between 10% ethanol solution and water. In groups 2-4 the decreased transketolase activity (marker thiamine-dependent enzyme) and thiamine diphosphate level in blood, liver and brain as well as signs of folic deficiency were found. In groups 3 and 4 the alcohol preference index on the first week of post-irradiation testing period increased on 40.8 and 112.7% (p<0.05); on the second week on 19,1 and 81.4% (P <0.05) accordingly. In conclusion, the combination of low dose irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency increases the alcohol preference and consumption in rats. Those factors may be one of the reason of alcohol addiction also in population of Chernobyl region.",Included
2047,"Space radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and memory impairment in mice: ameliorative potential of the melatonin metabolite, AFMK. Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",Included

Cerebellum is a vital organ responsible for the motor coordination and recently it has been reported to be involved in cognitive function. Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice. In addition, radiation induced augmentation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and a decline in the total antioxidant capacity in serum; these changes were also ameliorated by melatonin pretreatment.

2071,"Mental disorders in radiation encephalopathy. Chernobyl accident was major nuclear disaster in the history of mankind. Elimination of the consequences required large number of people. Most of them were exposed to the doses of radiation meeting criteria of so-called ""low doses"": 5 - 100 cGy. The impact of these doses on human health is not fully researched; mainly it refers to mental disorders. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and pathological patterns of formation of mental disorders in liquidators exposed to ""low doses"" of radiation because of the Chernobyl accident. A group of 500 liquidators was examined in a continuous research during 1995-1999 and in 2000-2001. Clinical, clinicalpsychological and psychophysiological methods were mainly used; biochemical blood analysis and functional studies also were used. Change in clinical parameters and survey results were observed in the dynamics. Primary morbidity: a separate group of ""cerebrovascular disorders"" was highlighted. In 1989 it accounted for 14 % of primary morbidity, digestive diseases - 9%, and respiratory diseases - 45 %. In 1994, vascular disorders accounted for 43 %, respiratory diseases - 7% , and the digestive diseases - 25; In 1998 cerebral vascular disorders took first place in the primary morbidity, alongside with the increase of combined diverse classes ""neoplasm"", ""endocrine system disorders"" and ""blood diseases"". Disability: In 1990 cerebrovascular disorders occupied 37 % of all cases of disability, in 1993 - 84% of all disability. These disorders consisted of 90% cerebral disorders and had a tendency to deteriorate over time. We have shown that by the year 1998-1999 the psychoorganic syndrome was presented in 65% of liquidators, and in 83% of cases because of the cerebral vascular disorders. The following clinical forms were described: affective (80%), psychopathic (14.8%), and dementic (5.2%). Over time among the liquidators the number of diseases of various organs and systems are increasing. Among these diseases, cerebrovascular disease comes first; organic CNS lesion (radiation encephalopathy) results in clinically detectable psychoorganic syndrome in the major group of examined liquidators. Thus, it can be concluded that even ""low doses"" of radiation are danger for mental health and its effect grows over time.",Included

CONTEXT: Radiotherapy is frequently administered as adjuvant treatment in patients with clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients. However, a CVE was found significantly more frequently in IRR men but not in women. Further research into the long-term effects of cranial radiotherapy seems mandatory. The potential risks of radiotherapy have to be taken into account when radiotherapy is considered in NFPA patients, and long-term follow-up is recommended.",Included

The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD.

It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.",Included

2149,"Systemic HDAC3 inhibition ameliorates impairments in synaptic plasticity caused by simulated galactic cosmic radiation exposure in male mice. Deep space travel presents a number of measurable risks including exposure to a spectrum of radiations of varying qualities, termed galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that are capable of penetrating the spacecraft, traversing through the body and impacting brain function. Using rodents, studies have reported that exposure to simulated GCR leads to cognitive impairments associated with changes in hippocampus function that can persist as long as one-year post exposure with no sign of recovery. Whether memory can be updated to incorporate new information in mice exposed to GCR is unknown. Further, mechanisms underlying long lasting impairments in cognitive function as a result of GCR exposure have yet to be defined. Here, we examined whether whole body exposure to simulated GCR using 6 ions and doses of 5 or 30 cGy interfered with the ability to update an existing memory or impact hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism believed to underlie memory processes, by examining long term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle aged male mice 3.5-5 months after radiation exposure. Using a modified version of the hippocampus-dependent object location memory task developed by our lab termed ""Objects in Updated Locations"" (OUL) task we find that GCR exposure impaired hippocampus-dependent memory updating and hippocampal LTP 3.5-5 months after exposure. Further, we find that impairments in LTP are reversed through one-time systemic subcutaneous injection of the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP 966 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that long lasting impairments in cognitive function may be mediated at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms.",Included

Due to an increasing concern about radiation-induced cognitive deficits for brain tumor patients receiving radiation therapy, developing and evaluating countermeasures has become inevitable. Our previous study has found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the present study, we report an unknown mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of minocycline. We demonstrated that minocycline prevented primary neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis and promoted radiation-induced autophagy in vitro. Moreover, using an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22 cells, we found that the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated HT22 cells was not related to DNA damage repair since minocycline did not facilitate DNA DSB repair in irradiated HT22 cells. Further investigation showed that minocycline significantly enhanced X-irradiation-induced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, thus resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, although the antioxidant potential of minocycline might contribute to its apoptosis-inhibitory effect, it was not involved in its enhancive effect on radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy. Taken together, we have revealed a novel mechanism for the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated neurons, e.g. minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis via enhancing radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

Cranial irradiation can trigger adverse effects on brain functions, including cognitive ability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced cognitive impairments remain still unknown. Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are implicated in neuronal plasticity and the related functions (i.e., memory formation) in the hippocampus. The present study quantitatively assessed changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the learning-induced IEGs, including Arc, c-fos, and zif268, in the mouse hippocampus after cranial irradiation using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mice (male, 8-week-old C57BL/6) received whole-brain irradiation with 0 or 10Gy of gamma-ray and, 2weeks later, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) was used to induce IEGs. In the CFC task, mice evaluated 2weeks after irradiation exhibited significant memory deficits compared with sham (0Gy)-irradiated controls. The levels of mRNA encoding IEGs were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus 10 and 30min after CFC training. The mRNA levels in the irradiated hippocampi were significantly lower than those in the sham-irradiated controls. The IEG protein levels were significantly increased in all hippocampal regions, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA)1, and CA3, after CFC training. The CFC-induced upregulation of Arc and c-fos in 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi was significantly lower than that in sham-irradiated controls, although there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the learning-induced zif268 between sham-irradiated and 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi. Thus, cranial irradiation with 10Gy of gamma-ray impairs the induction of hippocampal IEGs (particularly Arc and c-fos) via behavioral contextual fear memory, and this disturbance may be associated with the memory deficits evident in mice after cranial irradiation, possibly through the dysregulation of neuronal plasticity during memory formation.",Included

In high cognitive load trials, the initial impairment was observed ~1 month after irradiation. This was followed by a transient recovery period over the next 1-2 months, after which performance declined progressively through 11 months after irradiation. Nine months after irradiation, glucose uptake during the DMS task was decreased in the cuneate and prefrontal cortex and was increased in the cerebellum and thalamus compared with the levels prior to irradiation.

To test the hypothesis that the functional state of hypothalamic LHRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs might alter their radiosensitivity, we determined the experimental conditions under which the gonadotropin response to castration could be impaired by a single dose of cranial irradiation. Single doses of cranial irradiation greater than 2000 rads were lethal to unshielded rats. Shielding of the oropharynx and esophagus allowed the animals to survive doses up to 5000 rads. Doses between 2000 and 5000 rads had no effect on basal gonadotropin levels for as long as 3 months after irradiation. Irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment, however, in the gonadotropin response to castration. Impairment of the gonadotropin levels of castrate animals occurred in animals that were irradiated either before or after castration. However, rats irradiated in the castrate state showed a decreased susceptibility to irradiation damage. Additionally, stimulation of the pituitary by LHRH agonist (LHRHa) 3 h before irradiation significantly reduced the impairment of gonadotropin secretion 12-20 weeks after irradiation (P less than 0.05). Thus, increased functional activity of the rat hypothalamus or pituitary at the time of irradiation, induced by either castration or acute LHRHa administration, was associated with some protection against the gonadotropin-lowering effect of irradiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that stimulation of gonadotropin secretion at the time of therapeutic cranial irradiation in humans might protect against subsequent impairment of gonadotropin secretion.",Included
2251,"Long-Term Deficits in Behavior Performances Caused by Low- and High-Linear Energy Transfer Radiation. Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) require a better understanding of the effects of GCR on human health. In particular, little is known about the lasting effects of GCR on the central nervous system (CNS), which may lead to behavior performance deficits. Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses. A significant dose effect was observed on recognition memory and activity levels measured 9 months postirradiation, regardless of radiation source. In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior. In summary, our findings suggest that GCR not only affects the CNS in the short term, but also has lasting damaging effects on the CNS that can cause sustained declines in behavior performance.",Included
2253,"Impact of brain tumors and radiotherapy on the presence of gadolinium in the brain after repeated administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents: an experimental study in rats. PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations induced by an experimental tumor and radiotherapy on MRI signal intensity (SI) in deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and the presence of gadolinium after repeated administration of a linear gadolinium-based contrast agent in rats.METHODS: Eighteen Fischer rats were divided into a tumor (gliosarcoma, GS9L model), a radiotherapy, and a control group. All animals received 5 daily injections (1.8 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. For tumor-bearing animals, the BBB disruption was confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. Animals from the tumor and radiation group underwent radiotherapy in 6 fractions of 5 Gray. The SI ratio between DCN and brain stem was evaluated on T1-weigthed MRI at baseline and 1 week after the last administration. Subsequently, the brain was dissected for gadolinium quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was done with the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: An increased but similar DCN/brain stem SI ratio was found for all three groups (p = 0.14). The gadolinium tissue concentrations (median, nmol/g) were 6.7 (tumor), 6.3 (radiotherapy), and 6.8 (control) in the cerebellum (p = 0.64) and 17.8/14.6 (tumor), 20.0/18.9 (radiotherapy), and 17.8/15.9 (control) for the primary tumor (p = 0.98) and the contralateral hemisphere (p = 0.41) of the cerebrum, respectively.CONCLUSION: An experimental brain tumor treated by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone did not alter DCN signal hyperintensity and gadolinium concentration in the rat brain 1 week after repeated administration of gadopentetate. This suggests that a local BBB disruption does not affect the amount of retained gadolinium in the brain.",Included

2266,"Cancer incidence after localized therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Second cancers may occur in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers.",Included

2308,"Elevated DNA damage in a mouse model of oxidative stress: impacts of ionizing radiation and a protective dietary supplement. Transgenic growth hormone (Tg) mice express elevated free radical processes and a progeroid syndrome of accelerated ageing. We examined bone marrow cells of Tg mice and their normal (Nr) siblings for three markers of DNA damage and assessed the impact of free radical stress using ionizing radiation. We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice. Based on our data, the dietary supplement appeared to scavenge free radicals before they could cause damage. This study validates Tg mice as an exemplary model of oxidative stress and radiation hypersensitivity and documents unprecedented radioprotection by a dietary supplement comprised of ingredients available to the general public.",Included

Heme oxygenase catalyzes heme degradation and is an important component of the antioxidant defense. Nonprotein thiols participate in redox regulation of heme oxygenase gene expression. Changes in heme oxygenase activity and levels of nonprotein thiols in the liver, lungs, and brain of C57Bl/6 mice were studied on days 1-7 after whole-body gamma-irradiation in a dose of 10 Gy. The maximum increase in heme oxygenase activity was observed in the liver (to 196% in females and to 250% in males) and was associated with an 8-fold increase in the level of heme oxygenase-1 (inducible form of the enzyme) mRNA. The increase in heme oxygenase activity was less pronounced in the lungs, while in the brain this parameter slightly decreased.

2321,"Hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown. The vascular endothelial cell is believed to be a major target cell of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is associated with radiation-induced white matter lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Adult rats were irradiated with graded single doses of 0-22 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 28 weeks after radiation, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry with antialbumin antibody and gamma counting of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Hypoxia was assessed using two 2-nitroimidazole markers, [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-l-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF5), with binding in the rat spinal cord measured using gamma counting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the nonirradiated rat spinal cord, there was no evidence of BSCB disruption or VEGF expression. After 16-22 Gy, there was a dose-dependent increase in albumin staining and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid activity beginning at 16 weeks, consistent with barrier breakdown. A similar dose-dependent increase in white matter astrocytes that showed immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals for VEGF was observed. No increase in VEGF-positive cells was observed in gray matter. By 20 weeks after 20-22 Gy, animals developed white matter necrosis associated with diffuse albumin staining. Irradiated rat spinal cord showed a dose (16-22 Gy)- and time-dependent (16-20 weeks after 22 Gy) increase in [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise accumulation compared to nonirradiated controls. A similar pattern of dose- and time-dependent EF5 immunoreactivity was also observed in white matter. Areas of EF5 expression and VEGF in situ signals colocalized with areas of albumin immunoreactivity. It is concluded that there is a dose-dependent temporal and spatial association of hypoxia, VEGF up-regulation, and radiation-induced BSCB dysfunction. Hypoxia may provide the signal for VEGF up-regulation and perpetuate endothelial permeability damage in the central nervous system after ionizing radiation.",Included

Method(s): Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with an incidental intracranial meningioma (2007-2015). Outcomes recorded were postintervention morbidity, histopathologic diagnosis, and treatment response. Result(s): Out of 441 patients, 44 underwent treatment. Median age at intervention was 56.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49.6-66.5); patients included 35 women and 9 men. The main indication for imaging was headache (25.9%). Median meningioma volume was 4.55 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR, 1.91-8.61), and the commonest location was convexity (47.7%). Six patients underwent surgery at initial diagnosis. Thirty-eight had intervention (34 with surgery and 4 with radiotherapy) after a median active monitoring duration of 24 months (IQR, 11.8-42.0). Indications for treatment were radiologic progression (n = 26), symptom development (n = 6), and patient preference (n = 12). Pathology revealed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningioma in 36 patients and WHO grade 2 in 4 patients. The risk of postoperative surgical and medical morbidity requiring treatment was 25%. Early and late moderate adverse events limiting activities of daily living occurred in 28.6% of patients treated with radiotherapy. Recurrence rate after surgery was 2.5%. All meningiomas regressed or remained radiologically stable after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The morbidity after treatment of incidental intracranial meningioma is not negligible. Considering most operated tumors are WHO grade 1, treatment should be reserved for those manifesting symptoms or demonstrating substantial growth on radiologic surveillance.

2356,"Metabolic correction of cerebral radiation syndrome. DNA strand breaks that occur after irradiation activate the repair enzyme adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase, which consumes NAD as a substrate and causes depletion first of neuronal NAD and then of the ATP pool. This is considered to be the crucial link in the mechanism underlying the cerebral radiation syndrome (CRS). In this study, two ways to correct the CRS metabolically were examined: (a) prevention of depletion of NAD after irradiation by administration of the enzyme inhibitor nicotinamide and (b) shunting the NAD-dependent oxidative phosphorylation pathway of ATP resynthesis by administration of a substrate of NAD-independent oxidation, succinate. Cerebral lesions induced by radiation were modeled by irradiation of rats or rat brain homogenates with 150 Gy of X rays. The manifestations of CRS in rats (excitement, convulsions, etc.) closely resembled those seen after acute hypoxia. In brain homogenates, pyruvate tetrazolium-reductase activity decreased after irradiation and could be corrected by addition of NAD after irradiation. Succinate tetrazolium-reductase activity was not affected by irradiation. Oxygen consumption by brain homogenates after irradiation in vitro and in situ decreased, as did oxygen consumption by rats in vivo after cranio-caudal irradiation. Administration of nicotinamide or succinate prevented both the postirradiation decrease in respiration (in both rats in vivo and brain homogenates in vitro) and the development of cerebral radiation syndrome.

Under hypothermia, the protein-synthesizing system was shown to be damaged to a lesser degree and to be restored faster in comparison with similar neurons in rats irradiated at room temperature. In rats irradiated under hypothermia, the rRNA biogenesis and the protein-synthesizing activity of polyribosomes were restored in two days.

2361,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitors protect hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis by regulating MDM2-p53 pathway. Exposure of the brain to ionizing radiation can cause neurocognitive deficiencies. The pathophysiology of these neurological changes is complex and includes radiation-induced apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We have recently found that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) resulted in significant protection from radiation-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanisms of this cytoprotection include abrogation of radiation-induced accumulation of p53. Here we show that pretreatment of irradiated HT-22 hippocampal-derived neurons with small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3beta SB216763 or SB415286, or with GSK-3beta-specific shRNA resulted in accumulation of the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Knockdown of MDM2 using specific shRNA or chemical inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction prevented the protective changes triggered by GSK-3beta inhibition in irradiated HT-22 neurons and restored radiation cytotoxicity. We found that this could be due to regulation of apoptosis by subcellular localization and interaction of GSK-3beta, p53 and MDM2. These data suggest that the mechanisms of radioprotection by GSK-3beta inhibitors in hippocampal neurons involve regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 accumulation and interactions between GSK-3beta, MDM2 and p53.",Included

A 1-cm segment of rat cervical spinal cord was irradiated (16-150 Gy) and the animals were followed for 16 months to determine the dose-response relationship for the latent period for radiation myelopathy. The latent period was found to be dependent on dose in the ED0 to ED100 dose range, independent of dose in the range ED100 to 1.5 times the ED100 dose and dependent on dose for doses more than 1.5 times the ED100 dose. Histologically, some vascular injury and demyelinization were observed in the irradiated cord segment of all paretic animals. In the first dose-dependent region there was a bimodal distribution of latent periods, suggesting two mechanisms for paralysis in this dose region. A hypothesis based on glial and vascular injury is presented which explains the triphasic dose-response relationship for the latent period. The 95% confidence limits for the dose location of both of the dose-dependent regions were less than 10% of the administered dose. Therefore, if used correctly, the latent period as an end point should be able to be used to detect dose-modifying parameters (i.e. RBE and OER) that are greater than 20%.",Included

Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027).

BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.",Included

Aberrant neovascularization is a pathological hallmark of glioblastoma that correlates with poor clinical outcome. Factors that drive endothelial proliferation, recruitment into the tumor and angiogenesis in the context of radiotherapy are potentially novel therapeutic targets for glioma. Our studies showed high expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in gliomas; analyses of conditioned medium (CM) prepared from shRNA-mediated PAK4-knockdown (PAK4.sh) glioma cells using a human angiogenesis array showed a significant downregulation in key angiogenic factors including Gro-1alpha. Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included

The mice were irradiated at 100 days of age and euthanatized about 500 days (16 months) later. Exposures were: 60Co gamma photons (LETinfinity = 1-2 keV/micrometer), 4He (LETinfinity = 6 keV/micrometer), 12C (LETinfinity = 80 keV/micrometer), 20Ne (LETinfinity = 150 keV/micrometer), 56Fe (LETinfinity = 180 keV/micrometer), and 40Ar (LETinfinity = 650 keV/micrometer).

2440,"Divergent effects of irradiation on brain cortical morphology in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: one-year follow-up study using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Background: Increasing evidence indicates that radiotherapy (RT)-induced brain cortical deficits may play a critical role in developing radiation encephalopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the evolutional processes of RT-induced cortical injury have not been sufficiently investigated. This study investigates RT-induced effects on cortical morphology using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPC patients.Methods: Using MRI-based morphometry with surface-based measures, we evaluated the longitudinal alterations of cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 104 NPC patients at pre-RT (n=104), within 3 months post-RT (n=92), 6 months post-RT (n=71), and 9-12 months post-RT (n=52). Twenty healthy controls were also evaluated in parallel. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies.",Included

Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Included

Background and purpose: To evaluate the impact of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in adult WHO grade II-III intracranial ependymoma (IEPN). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 172 pathologically confirmed adult grade II-III IEPN patients from 12 institutions were eligible. Of them, 106 (61.6%) and 66 (38.4%) patients were grade II and III, respectively. For grade II and III IEPNs, 51 (48.1%) and 59 (89.4%) patients received PORT, respectively. The median dose to the primary tumor bed was 54.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy for grade II and III patients, respectively. The prognostic impact of sex, age, performance, WHO grade, location, size, surgical extent, and PORT on local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up period for survivors was 88.1 months. The 5-/10-year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 64.8%/54.0%, 56.4%/44.8%, and 76.6%/71.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant PORT significantly improved LC (P = 0.002), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.043). Older age (P < 0.001), WHO grade III (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.004), and lesser surgical extent (P < 0.001) were also negative factors for OS. Adjuvant PORT also improved LC (P = 0.010), PFS (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.069) on multivariate analysis for grade II IEPNs. Conclusion(s): This multicenter retrospective study supports the role of adjuvant PORT in terms of disease control and survival in adult grade II-III IEPNs. Prospective randomized trials focused on individualized treatment based on molecular subtypes is warranted. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Included

Contractile properties of skeletal muscles of rats were investigated using glycerinated muscle preparations that were obtained from Cosmos-1887 animals flown for 13 days (plus 2 days on the ground) and from rats that remained hypokinetic for 13 days on the ground. In the flow rats, the absolute mass of postural muscles remained unchanged while their relative mass increased; this may be attributed to their enhanced hydration which developed during the first 2 days after landing. Strength losses of the postural muscles were less significant than after previous flights.

2496,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles. Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation.",Included
2499,"Microglial cytokine gene induction after irradiation is affected by morphologic differentiation. Microglia are known to play an important role in the CNS cytokine network, and their response after irradiation may be associated with the development of radiation-induced tissue damage. Radiation effects on this cytokine network have not yet been elucidated. We investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation on microglia stimulated with Zymosan A and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which alone induce the expression of some cytokines and neurotoxic products by microglial cells. In the resting condition (ramified microglia), radiation had no effect on the mRNA level corresponding to cytokines such as IL1beta or IL-6, although TGF-beta1 mRNA was minimally enhanced by irradiation. However, in the activated microglia (amoeboid microglia) stimulated with Zymosan A, radiation-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased about two-fold in comparison with non-irradiation. IL-1beta was slightly induced by 2 Gy irradiation, but was not induced by higher doses. TGF-beta1 mRNA was not enhanced by radiation following Zymosan stimulation. In the LPS-stimulated condition, IL-6 mRNA was induced only by 2 Gy of irradiation, but no change in the expression of other genes was detected. These results suggested that radiation exerted different effects on cytokine gene transcription in microglia depending on their morphological state.",Included

While the effects of high dose X-irradiation on mitotically active progenitor cells and remyelination are well-documented, its effects on myelinating oligodendrocytes are less clear, due in part to divergent views on their mitotic capacity. To examine the effect of X-irradiation on oligodendrocytes, the spinal cord of rats was exposed to 40 Gy of X-irradiation and the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the dorsal funiculi at T12 and L1 was determined by in situ hybridization using cRNA-probes for platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFRalpha) (to identify oligodendrocyte progenitors), exon 3b of proteolipid protein (PLP) (to identify mature oligodendrocytes) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). X-irradiation resulted in no change in the number of PLP positive cells and no loss of myelin internodes, but caused an almost complete loss of PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, and a reduction in the number of MOG positive cells to a number similar to that found using the PLP exon 3b probe. Importantly, the number of radiation-sensitive MOG-expressing cells was similar to the number of PDGFRalpha positive cells. To determine if the radiation-sensitive MOG positive cells were the same population as the radiation sensitive PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, MOG and PDGFRalpha-expressing cells were isolated from the adult CNS using antibody coated magnetic beads. Twelve to thirteen percent of MOG positive cells were PDGFRalpha positive and nearly all the PDGFRa isolated cells were MOG and galactocerebroside positive. Double immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of NG2 and MOG on cells in the normal adult rat spinal cord. These results show that in situ in the adult rat spinal cord white matter oligodendrocyte progenitors are MOG positive and indicates that expression of MOG cannot be regarded a marker that only identifies mature myelin-supporting oligodendrocytes in tissue.",Included

Background: Prior research has indicated neuroanatomical abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia. To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Method(s): Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Result(s): Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusion(s): A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood.

This dose is known to produce myelopathy in all animals within 6 months of irradiation. After irradiation, the animals were subdivided into three groups, and at 90 days after irradiation, neural stem cells or saline (for controls) were injected into the spinal cord, intramedullary, at two sites positioned 6 mm apart on either side of the center of the irradiated length of spinal cord. The injection volume was 2 microl. Group I received a suspension of MHP36 cells, Group II MHP15 cells, and Group III (controls) two injections of 2 microl saline. All rats received 10 mg/kg cyclosporin (10 mg/ml) daily i.p. to produce immunosuppression. All animals that received saline (Group III) developed paralysis within 167 days of irradiation.

In our previous work we established conditions to study the contribution of non-neuronal cells to the process of goldfish optic nerve regeneration. This issue has been studied successfully by adapting the use of X-irradiation to manipulate division of non-neuronal cells associated with the injured nerve. The regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells was determined subsequent to the X-ray treatment. In this work we present an analysis of the molecular events associated with regeneration and enhanced regenerative capacity which follows X-irradiation. Under normal conditions the non-neuronal cells surrounding an intact nerve released axonal growth inhibitors, the level of which was only slightly sensitive to X-irradiation. In contrast, regenerating nerves showed a marked decrease in substances having an inhibitory effect on sprouting in vitro. Moreover, their level was significantly reduced following X-irradiation which was accompanied by increased accumulation of fibrous collagen adjacent to astrocytes. The alteration in the reciprocal relationship between the axon and the surrounding non-neuronal cells was also manifested by changes in the profile of labeled proteins released by the non-neuronal cells. The results of this work, therefore, indicate the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the environment provided by the cells surrounding the regenerating fibers and thus may open a new perspective relating to the capacity of neurons to regenerate.",Included

OBJECTIVE: The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage is unclear. We examined the effect of early treatment of high-dose dexamethasone on iridium-192-induced damage to normal brain tissue.METHODS: Brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation with iridium-192 was evaluated with sequential magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 11 adult monkeys, with or without short-term high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight/d) was administered intramuscularly to five irradiated animals every 24 hours, beginning 2 days before and ending 7 days after irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after irradiation.RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 week after irradiation revealed marked edema in five nontreated animals. In dexamethasone-treated animals, the volume of edema was reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 1 week and 1 month after irradiation. The volume of ring enhancement in dexamethasone-treated animals was also reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 3 months after the irradiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra revealed that N-acetylaspartate and choline peaks were reduced 1 week after irradiation in both groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time points.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dexamethasone treatment may have an antiedema effect at an early stage and may modify subsequent development of vascular and inflammatory changes but may have no effect of preventing radiation-induced necrosis and the reduction of N-acetylaspartate after brachytherapy.",Included

Adult rabbits were subjected to 4.5 Gy of whole-blody or brain alone gamma-irradiation, and their hippocampus was examined with the light and electron microscope. Pycnotic cells were found at the base of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in the so-called subgranular zone, as soon as 3 h after irradiation, and were cleared up by active phagocytosis after 48 h. Some of these cells appeared as undifferentiated, whereas others were differentiating granule cells, and possibly immature neuroglia. The extent of cell necrosis was contingent upon the age of the animal, the oldest animal studied (27 months) showing only sparse lesion of that type. Astrocytes and microglia were responsible for the phagocytosis of dead cells. Another type of lesion was found in the nuclei of the mature granule cells and consisted of light spots which appeared 1 h after the irradiation and disappeared almost completely after 48 h. Pyramidal cells did not show any of these two lesions. It is concluded that the laterations in the electrical activity of pyrimidal cells, following irradiation, are at least partly due to lesions affecting the dentate gyrus.

Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established.",Included
2627,"Effects of combined immune and radiation cancer therapy on inflammatory environment in the brain of a mouse model. Purpose/Objective(s): Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These can include difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and increased anxiety. Though changes are often associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation, these effects are also seen in patients who receive peripheral but no cranial irradiation and no chemotherapy. A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance.

2653,"Oxidative stress and adult neurogenesis-Effects of radiation and superoxide dismutase deficiency. Hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and in spatial navigation. Production of new neurons that are functionally integrated into the hippocampal neuronal network is important for the maintenance of functional plasticity. In adults, production of new neurons in the hippocampus takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. Neural progenitor/stem cells go through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation. This process is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress, and perturbation in the redox balance in the neurogenic microenvironment can lead to reduced neurogenesis. Cranial irradiation is an effective treatment for primary and secondary brain tumors. However, even low doses of irradiation can lead to persistent elevation of oxidative stress and sustained suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes for the removal of superoxide radicals in different subcellular compartments. To identify the subcellular location where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated after cranial irradiation, different SOD deficient mice have been used to determine the effects of irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. The study results suggest that, regardless of the subcellular location, SOD deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the production of new neurons in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus. In exchange, the generation of new glial cells was significantly increased. The SOD deficient condition, however, altered the tissue response to irradiation, and SOD deficient mice were able to maintain a similar level of neurogenesis after irradiation while wild type mice showed a significant reduction in the production of new neurons. © 2012.",Included

The incidence for hemorrhage in non-obliterated arteriovenous malformations (AVM) during the first two years following Gamma Knife (GK) surgery was compared to the calculated incidence in untreated patients. There was a decrease in the incidence of hemorrhage as compared to the natural course. This difference was statistically significant. The actual number of hemorrhages during the first two years was 49 in a series of 1604 patients. Additionally, 41 hemorrhages occurred beyond the two years following treatment over the entire follow up time span of up to 24 years. For the first two years the calculated incidence was roughly two times higher than the observed incidence. This impact on the natural history was detectable already within six months after the treatment for the malformations totally covered with at least 25 Gy. The relation between a high minimum and a high average dose on the one hand and a lower risk for hemorrhage on the other hand was statistically significant. Low treatment doses and high age correlated to a higher risk. Neither hemorrhage prior to treatment nor time interval between presenting hemorrhage and treatment seemed to influence the risk for post treatment hemorrhage.

Acute X irradiation of the metacerebral giant neurons of Helix pomatia above 1000 R or 3.4 kR/min (dose or dose rate threshold) leads to a significant reduction of the membrane potential. After blocking the afferent excitatory synapses the radiation depolarizations are strongly decreased but not completely suppressed. Long time irradiation at high dose rates and after the blocking of afferent synapses produced a depolarization in 2 phases: an immediate quick depolarization of about 10 mV is followed by a much slower decrease of the membrane potential. Substitution of extracellular sodium by tris ions suppresses the quick depolarization phase. The input resistance of the cell shows a transient increase at the begin of irradiation followed by a substantial decrease.

2719,"Short and long-term evaluation of the impact of proton minibeam radiation therapy on motor, emotional and cognitive functions. Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used methods for cancer treatment. Despite remarkable advancements in RT techniquesthe treatment of radioresistant tumours (i.e. high-grade gliomas) is not yet satisfactory. Finding novel approaches less damaging for normal tissues is of utmost importance. This would make it possible to increase the dose applied to tumours, resulting in an improvement in the cure rate. Along this line, proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel strategy that allows the spatial modulation of the dose, leading to minimal damage to brain structures compared to a high dose (25 Gy in one fraction) of standard proton therapy (PT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pMBRT also preserves important cerebral functions. Comprehensive longitudinal behavioural studies were performed in irradiated (peak dose of 57 Gy in one fraction) and control rats to evaluate the impact of pMBRT on motor function (motor coordination, muscular tonus, and locomotor activity), emotional function (anxiety, fear, motivation, and impulsivity), and cognitive function (learning, memory, temporal processing, and decision making). The evaluations, which were conducted over a period of 10 months, showed no significant motor or emotional dysfunction in pMBRT-irradiated rats compared with control animals. Concerning cognitive functions, similar performance was observed between the groups, although some slight learning delays might be present in some of the tests in the long term after irradiation.

2730,"Cerebromicrovascular dysfunction predicts cognitive decline and gait abnormalities in a mouse model of whole brain irradiation-induced accelerated brain senescence. Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is a mainstream therapy for patients with both identifiable brain metastases and prophylaxis for microscopic malignancies. However, it also promotes accelerated senescence in healthy tissues and leads to progressive cognitive dysfunction in up to 50% of tumor patients surviving long term after treatment, due to gamma-irradiation-induced cerebromicrovascular injury. Moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) via neuronal activity-dependent cerebromicrovascular dilation (functional hyperemia) has a critical role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. To determine whether cognitive decline induced by WBI associates with impaired cerebromicrovascular function, C56BL/6 mice (3 months) subjected to a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) and control mice were compared. Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker-stimulation-induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post-irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post-irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post-irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident.

This study was undertaken to test the effect of irradiation on the histopathology of the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex. In addition, the probable effects of radiotherapy on the activities of antioxidant enzymes and levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the plasma were investigated as well. The effects of melatonin treatment on radiotherapy-based central nervous system (CNS) damage were also studied. For this purpose, the rats were randomized into four groups. The first group was the control group (sham-exposed group), the second group received only melatonin, the third group was irradiated and the fourth group received both melatonin and irradiation. Plasma samples of rats were collected for measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the levels of NO. 24 h after the interventions, tissue samples were obtained from the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex for the light microscopic investigations. These tissues were mostly affected by radiation. The results indicated that the application of radiation significantly enhanced the levels of plasma SOD and NO. On the other hand, melatonin pretreatment prevented the decrease in plasma CAT activity induced by irradiation. It was found that the application of melatonin could significantly prevent the irradiation-induced damages. Light microscopic results revealed that the damage of the CNS by radiation was prevented by the application of melatonin.",Included

The space radiation environment contains high-energy charged particles such as <sup>56</sup>Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to hippocampal function in astronauts during and after the mission(s). The mechanisms underlying impairments in cognition are not clear but might involve alterations in the percentage of neurons in the dentate gyrus expressing the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Previously, we showed effects of cranial <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation on hippocampus-dependent contextual freezing and on the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed, but not free, blade. Because it is unclear whether whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation causes similar effects on these markers of hippocampal function, in the present study we quantified the effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation (600MeV, 0.5 or 1Gy) on hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent cognitive performance and determined whether these effects were associated with changes in Arc expression in the enclosed and free blades of the dentate gyrus. Whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation impacted contextual but not cued fear freezing and the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In addition, in mice irradiated with 0.5Gy, contextual freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed blade. In mice tested for cued freezing, there was no correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In contrast, cued freezing in the presence or absence of aversive stimuli correlated with Arc-positive cells in the free blade. In addition, in mice irradiated with 1Gy cued freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive neurons in the free blade. These data indicate that while whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation affects contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, the enclosed blade might be more important for contextual freezing while the free blade might be more important for cued freezing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Included

Although radiotherapy is often used to treat laryngeal carcinoma, there is little information on the effects of this treatment on laryngeal structures. Rats were irradiated to the head and neck region and the larynges were studied by light- and electron-microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Ten days after irradiation, a change in the ultrastructural appearance of the granules of the subglottic glands was observed. Substance P-, bombesin- and enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was increased in local ganglionic cells and glandular nerve fibres. The mast cells were reduced in number. At examination 4 6 months after irradiation, there were no obvious differences compared with controls concerning mast-cell numbers and neuropeptide expression. The ultrastructural changes seen in the subglottic glands remained to some extent. The results show that structural changes in the subglottic glands occur concomitantly with an increased expression of certain neuropeptides in the innervation of these glands, which implies a relationship between these two parameters. The mast cells respond drastically to irradiation, but in the long run, regeneration of these cells occurs.",Included

The effects of X-irradiation on proliferating cells in the dentate subgranular zone were assessed in young adult Fisher 344 rats exposed to a range of X-ray doses and followed for up to 120 days. Apoptosis was quantified using morphology and end-labeling immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation was detected using antibodies against the thymidine analog BrdU and the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2). Radiation-induced apoptosis occurred rapidly, with maximum morphological and end-labeling changes observed 3-6h after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to sham-irradiated controls. The number of apoptotic nuclei increased rapidly with radiation dose, reaching a plateau at about 3Gy. The maximum number of apoptotic nuclei was substantially higher than the number of proliferating cells, suggesting that non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells in the subgranular zone were sensitive to irradiation. Subgranular zone cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to age-matched controls 120 days after doses of 5Gy or higher. These findings suggest that neural precursor cells of the dentate gyrus are very sensitive to irradiation and are not capable of repopulating the subgranular zone at least up to 120 days after irradiation. This may help explain, in part, how ionizing irradiation induces cognitive impairments in animals and humans.",Included

The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 was measured with co-immunoprecipitation method, and the expression of cerebral choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) was measured by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RKIP significantly down-regulated at 6 h after radiation, and recovered at 1 d in group EMP, but the down-regulation continued during 1 approximately 7 d after radiation in the two microwave groups. The expression of RKIP mRNA changed wavily during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, which showed down-regulation at 6 h, and up-regulation at 3 d. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 decreased during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, most significantly at 7 d, and the two microwave groups were more significant.

2779,"Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ameliorates radiation-induced ototoxicity in zebrafish and cochlea-derived cell lines. Radiation is a widely used treatment for head and neck cancers, and one of its most severe side effects is ototoxicity. Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts. The results of this study suggest that p38 plays an important role in mediating radiation-induced ototoxicity and inhibition of p38 could be a plausible option for preventing radiation ototoxicity.",Included

The cause and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown. Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included

Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis.",Included

In the regenerating goldfish optic nerves, Schwann cells of unknown origin reliably infiltrate the lesion site forming a band of peripheral-type myelinating tissue by 1-2 months, sharply demarcated from the adjacent new CNS myelin. To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue.",Included
2808,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure. Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included

Sequential behavioral studies including one and two-way avoidance tests were undertaken before and after the 7 months following radiation. The results suggest that radiation induced progressive and irreversible memory dysfunction in elderly (18-month-old) rats, but this effect was partial or almost reversible in the 4-month-old and 45-day-old rats, respectively.

Spatial learning and memory ability of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy were used to assess the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, were measured by using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activation of microglial cells and expression of TNF-alpha were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and IkappaBalpha, and the translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus were detected by using Western blotting. Morris water maze test showed that Corilagin ameliorated the neurocognitive deficits in RIBI mice. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy exhibited that Corilagin partially protected the BBB integrity from cranial irradiation-caused damage; immunofluorescence staining showed that Corilagin could inhibit microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression. Real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that Corilagin downregulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and inhibited the irradiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB pathways by upregulating p-STAT3 expression. In conclusion, Corilagin could attenuate RIBI through inhibiting microglial activation and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines.

Proton irradiation was associated with depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test, but this effect was ameliorated by the pomegranate diet. Males, in general, displayed worse coordination and balance than females on the rotarod task, and the pomegranate diet ameliorated this effect. Overall, it appears that proton irradiation, which may be encountered in space, may induce a different pattern of behavioral deficits in males than females and that a pomegranate diet may confer protection against some of those effects.",Included
2916,"Symptoms 10-17 years after breast cancer radiotherapy data from the randomised SWEBCG91-RT trial. BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiotherapy decreases the risk for local recurrence and improves overall survival in women with breast cancer. We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001). Daily life and analgesic use did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Ten to 17 years after postoperative radiotherapy 1 in 12 women had weekly pain that could be attributed to radiotherapy. The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women.",Included

The levels of DNA fragmentation (using a neutral version of the ""Comet assay"" method) in the cells of somatic (brain ganglia) and generative (male gonad) tissues of the inbred individuals of the Drosophila wild-type developing in different conditions of a chronic irradiation were estimated. It was found that the radiobiological effect depends on the genotype and cytotype. Irradiation at low doses (0.42 mGy/h) induces the DNA damage in somatic cells of all the studied lines Drosophila in the same way. With the increase in the intensity of chronic irradiation (3.5mGy/h) a significant level of DNA breaks in neuroblasts was observed only for Harwich and Oregon-R stocks, in the cells of male gonad--for all the studied genotypes.",Included
2924,"Gel-based proteomics of unilateral irradiated striatum after gamma knife surgery. Gamma knife surgery (GKS) is used for the treatment of various brain disorders. The biological effects of focal gamma ray irradiation on targeted or surrounding areas in the brain are not well-known. In the present study, we evaluated protein expression changes in the unilateral irradiated (60 Gy) striatum in rat. Striata of irradiated and control brains were dissected 16 h post-irradiation for analysis by large-format two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). In parallel, we also examined the un-targeted contralateral striatum over the control for potential changes in proteins patterns that may have occurred due to the effects of irradiation to the unilateral striatum. A total of 17 reproducible and differentially expressed silver nitrate-stained protein spots in the irradiated striatum was detected on 2-D gel. Their subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 13 nonredundant proteins. Interestingly, out of these 13 changed proteins, 2 proteins were also detected in the contralateral striatum. Some of the significantly changed proteins identified were creatine kinase, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDA3), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2). Western analysis with anti-PDA3 and anti-Prx2 antibodies revealed 4 and 2 cross-reacting protein spots on 2-D gel blots. Interestingly, after GKS, in the irradiated and un-irradiated striata, these spots showed a shift toward the acidic side, suggesting post-translational modifications. Taken together, these results indicate that unilateral irradiation during GKS triggers molecular changes in the bilateral striata.",Included

The aim of this interdisciplinary project is to establish slice culture preparations from rodents and humans as a new model system for studying effects of X-rays and heavy ions within normal and tumor tissues. The advantage of such slice cultures relies on the conservation of an organotypic environment, the easy treatment and observation by live-imaging microscopy, and the independence from genetic immortalization strategies used to generate cell lines. Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months. Human brain tumor slices remained vital for at least 21 days. Slices were irradiated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt/Main at doses up to 40 Gy. Heavy ion irradiations were performed at GSI (Darmstadt) with different ions, energies, and doses. The irradiated slices were analyzed by 3D-confocal microscopy following immunostaining for DNA damage, microglia, and proliferation markers.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis whether the effects of GH replacement therapy in adults could be affected by prior pituitary irradiation, the baseline characteristics and response to GH were evaluated in adults with severe GH deficiency (GHD), who had received or not irradiation for the treatment of pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma.DESIGN: Data from 447 patients, who had received radiotherapy (427 in addition to surgery), and 630 patients, who were operated on but not irradiated for their tumour, were retrieved from Pfizer International Metabolic Database (KIMS) and compared at baseline and 1 and 2 years following the onset of GH replacement.RESULTS: Irradiated and non-irradiated patients exhibited the expected phenotype of GHD at baseline. However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response. These beneficial effects were maintained and the BMC also increased in both groups by the second year of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that prior irradiation for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma does not compromise the beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy.",Included

The composition of the lesion correlated with dose: the lower-dose lesions were found histologically to contain areas of edema, demyelination, reactive gliosis, and vascular proliferation; the higher-dose lesions contained increasing amounts of hemorrhage and coagulative necrosis. The borders of the lesions were sharply demarcated from surrounding normal brain. Gadolinium-enhanced MR studies correlated well with areas of blood-brain barrier breakdown, as confirmed by areas of Evans blue staining. This model could serve as the basis for further studies of the biological effects of LINAC radiosurgery.",Included

The duration of the latent period was found to be directly proportional to the age of the animal at the time of irradiation, and independent of radiation dose or the volume of the cervical cord which was irradiated. In the majority of paretic animals, the irradiated segment of the spinal cord demonstrated white matter necrosis. The results indicate that in the developing rat, the manifestations of radiation myelopathy are delayed by an interval determined in part by the age of the animal at the time of irradiation.",Included

BACKGROUND: Palliative irradiation of osteolytic lesions is a considerable component in the treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of irradiation in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with multiple myeloma who were admitted to our department between 1989 and 2013. According to the staging system of Durie & Salmon 116 patients were classified as stage III. 107/153 patients were treated with radiotherapy of at least one and up to 6 bony lesions at different times. In order to evaluate the effect of local radiotherapy on pain relief and bone recalcification a uni- and multivariate analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model to correct for multiple measurements. Complete information on dose, fractionation and volume of radiotherapy was available from 81 patients treated in 136 target volumes for pain relief, and from 69 patients treated in 108 target volumes for recalcification. Total radiation doses varied between 8 Gy to 50 Gy (median dose 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions, 5 times a week).RESULTS: Radiotherapy resulted in complete local pain relief in 31% and partial local pain relief in 54% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, higher total radiation doses (p = 0.023) and higher age (p = 0.014) at the time of radiotherapy were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of pain relief, whereas no significant association was detected for concurrent systemic treatment, type and stage of myeloma and location of bone lesions. The same variables were independent predictors for pain relief in the multivariate analysis. Recalcification was observed in 48% of irradiated bone lesions. In the uni- and multivariate analysis higher radiation doses were significantly associated (p = 0.048) with an increased likelihood of recalcification. Side effects of radiotherapy were generally mild.CONCLUSIONS: Higher total biological radiation doses were associated with better pain relief and recalcification in this retrospective evaluation of multiple myeloma patients. In addition, in the elderly the therapeutic measures appear to develop a better analgesic effect.",Included

Cancer survivors were also compared on the basis of treatment intervention, involving chemotherapy (n = 27) versus local therapy through surgery and radiation (n = 30).RESULTS: As a group, the breast cancer survivors scored lower on measures of general cognitive function, working memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function when compared with the normal comparisons. Among the cancer survivors, those who received local therapy scored lower than the other survivors and normal comparisons on measures of verbal learning, visual perception and construction, as well as visual attention and short-term retention.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cognitive outcomes may involve greater age-related deficits among older cancer survivors compared with matched healthy subjects.",Included
3030,"Cost-Effectiveness of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus MRI Surveillance for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer. Purpose: Owing to conflicting prospective data, controversy exists regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for patients with ES-SCLC based on currently available evidence and in the context of the proposed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services alternative payment model. Methods and Materials: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing MRI surveillance alone with PCI for ES-SCLC. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data, and cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to consider model uncertainty. Result(s): In the base-case scenario, PCI was not cost-effective in this model, with an ICER of $168,456 per QALY gained compared with MRI surveillance alone, assuming that overall survival was 10 months for MRI surveillance alone and 12.5 months for PCI. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the variation of overall survival and cognitive decline rates between the 2 groups. In a scenario analysis in which all patients received hippocampal-avoidance PCI, the model results became nearly cost-effective with PCI. Conclusion(s): PCI was not found to be cost-effective within this model compared with MRI surveillance alone, owing to the neurocognition decline effect of PCI based on available evidence. Hippocampal-avoidance PCI may be a potential cost-effective strategy for ES-SCLC, with confirmation expected after an ongoing prospective clinical trial (The Southwest Oncolology Group MRI Brain Surveillance Alone Versus MRI Surveillance And Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation [MAVERICK]), which includes assessments of cognitive function.

3044,"Collateral damage of radiation to normal tissues: What can the retina tell us?. Purpose : Damage to normal tissue in an irradiated field (normal tissue injury, NTI) is a complication of radiation therapy believed to be caused by microvessel pathology. In the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), vascular pathology was described in uveal melanoma (UM) patients 2 years post-radiation therapy. However, the COMS and other studies used subjective scoring systems, lacked a control group, did not assess neuronal function in detail, and used dosimetry methods simplified for clinical application. Methods : Optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) was used to characterize vascular pathology by vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size, parafoveal density (PVD), and by machine learning-derived density maps. OCT-derived retinal layer thickness and 10-2 visual field testing (VF) were used to quantify corresponding neuronal loss and dysfunction. Patient-specific 3D dosimetry models were constructed to spatially correlate dose to each outcome measure. Measurements were taken in both eyes of 31 UM patients at 0.5-150 mo post-<sup>125</sup>I plaque brachytherapy, and 16 age-matched controls. Data were normalized to the contralateral eye to account for subject variation due to age or systemic disease. Results : Abnormal vessel density, FD, lacunarity, FAZ size, and PVD were observed after 24 mo in 25 out of 31 subjects, whereas only 6 subjects showed any vascular pathology before 24 mo. Visual acuity was the least sensitive indicator of adverse outcome, with only 16% of the entire population showing a visual decline of two or more Snellen lines since diagnosis. Neuronal dysfunction by VF correlated strongly with most measures, especially vessel density, thinning of the superficial retina, and radiation dose (p<0.001). Abnormalities were observed only at doses above 20 Gy. Conclusions : Using a series of quantitative approaches, radiation microvasculopathy was detected starting at 24 mo post-exposure in most patients. Strong correlations between loss of neuronal function, vascular pathology, and dose were observed. Prospective studies will help determine whether vascular pathology precedes neuronal loss.",Included

PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.",Included
3073,"Early effects of whole-body (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function in C57BL/6J mice. Relatively little is known about early irradiation effects on hippocampal function in wild-type mice. In this study, the effects of (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function were assessed starting 2 weeks after whole-body irradiation. Compared to sham irradiation, radiation impaired novel object recognition in female and male C57BL/6J wild-type mice. There were no effects of irradiation on contextual fear conditioning or spatial memory retention in the water maze. It is possible that oxidative damage might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive changes. Therefore, hippocampal and cortical levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and lipid peroxidation, measures of oxidative damage were assessed. There were no effects of irradiation on these measures of oxidative damage. As (56)Fe irradiation can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which may contribute to the impairments in novel object recognition, the effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on cognition following sham irradiation and irradiation were also assessed. ALA did not prevent radiation-induced impairments in novel object recognition and impaired spatial memory retention of sham-irradiated and irradiated mice in the probe trial after the first day of hidden platform training in the water maze. Thus, the novel object recognition test is particularly sensitive to detect early cognitive effects of (56)Fe irradiation through a mechanism unlikely involving ROS or oxidative damage.",Included
3078,"Simulated Microgravity and Low-Dose/Low-Dose-Rate Radiation Induces Oxidative Damage in the Mouse Brain. Microgravity and radiation are stressors unique to the spaceflight environment that can have an impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These stressors could potentially lead to significant health risks to astronauts, both acutely during the course of a mission or chronically, leading to long-term, post-mission decrements in quality of life. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to high concentrations of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids and low levels of antioxidant defenses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative damage in the brain cortex and hippocampus in a ground-based model for spaceflight, which includes prolonged unloading and low-dose radiation. Whole-body low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma radiation using (57)Co plates (0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) was delivered to 6 months old, mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-6/group) to simulate the radiation component. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Brains were isolated 7 days or 9 months after irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for characterization of oxidative stress markers and microvessel changes. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, was significantly elevated in the cortex and hippocampus after LDR + HLU compared to controls (P < 0.05). The combination group also had the highest level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression compared to controls (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the animals that received HLU only or combined LDR + HLU compared to control (P < 0.05). In addition, 9 months after LDR and HLU exposure, microvessel densities were the lowest in the combination group, compared to age-matched controls in the cortex (P < 0.05). Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers that may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress.",Included

BACKGROUND: Radiation induces time-dependent loss of anterior pituitary function, attributed to damage of the pituitary gland and hypothalamic centres. The development of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in irradiated acromegaly patients is not well defined.OBJECTIVE: Detailed analysis of spontaneous 24-h GH and prolactin (PRL) secretion in relation to other pituitary functions and serum IGF-I concentrations in an attempt to find criteria for GHD in acromegalic patients with a GH response < 3 microg/l during the insulin tolerance test (ITT).DESIGN: Plasma hormone profiles obtained by 10 min sampling for 24 h in postoperatively irradiated acromegalic patients, compared with patients cured by surgery only and matched healthy controls.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: University setting. Fifteen subjects in each group.OUTCOME MEASURES: GH and PRL secretory parameters quantified by deconvolution, cluster, cosinor and approximate entropy (ApEn) analyses, IGF-I concentrations.RESULTS: Irradiation attenuated pulsatile secretion of GH and PRL, but total PRL secretion was unchanged. GH and PRL secretory regularity were diminished. Circadian timing remained intact. Pulsatile GH secretion and IGF-I were correlated (R = 0.30, P = 0.04). Criteria of pulsatile GH secretion = 12 microg/l/24 h and ApEn = 0.800 separated 12 of 15 irradiated patients from all others.CONCLUSION: Irradiated acromegaly patients with a subnormal GH response to ITT have very limited spontaneous GH secretion, with specific attenuation of the size of GH bursts and a highly irregular pattern, but with retained diurnal properties.

Participants were stratified by stage (IIIA v IIIB), histology (nonsquamous v squamous), and therapy (surgery v none) and were randomly assigned to PCI or observation. PCI was delivered to 30 Gy in 15 fractions. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS), neurocognitive function (NCF), and quality of life. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used for OS and DFS. The incidence of brain metastasis (BM) was evaluated with the logistic regression model.RESULTS: Overall, 356 patients were accrued of the targeted 1,058.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the in-vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes with a special FISH/CISS-technique.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1993 through April 1996, a total number of 52 cancer patients was enrolled in the study. The tumor sites in these patients were: breast (n = 41), lung (n = 4), head and neck (n = 3) as well as prostate, bladder, rectal cancer and Hodgkin's disease (each n = 1). Twenty-six of them were examined prior to planned radiotherapy (prospective group) and 26 after radiotherapy (retrospective group). Three additional individuals (without cancer or radiotherapy) with proven ataxia telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome, AT-homozygotes) were also investigated and their blood samples served as positive control for radiosensitivity. The clinical radiation response of normal tissue in radiotherapy patients was scored according to the WHO grading system for acute and according to the RTOG grading system for late effects. For to estimate the intrinsic radiosensitivity, blood samples were taken and irradiated in vitro with 0 (control) or 0.7 or 2 Gy with a 6 MV-linear accelerator, standard 48-hour lymphocyte cultures were prepared, chromosomes #1, #2 and #4 were simultaneously labeled with a FISH/CISS-technique and 200 to 1,000 metaphase spreads were scored for chromosomal aberrations. The radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes was expressed as the number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks per mitosis after 0.7 Gy or 2 Gy corrected for the 0-Gy control value.RESULTS: The frequency of chromosomal breaks/mitosis in the unirradiated control lymphocytes was 0.020 +/- 0.015 in prospective patients who had not yet received radiotherapy. It was significantly higher in retrospective patients (0.264 +/- 0.164 breaks/mitosis) as a result of the previous radiation exposure. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed also an increased number of spontaneous chromosomal breaks (0.084 +/- 0.016 breaks/mitosis), probably resulting from the chromosomal instability in this disease. This figure, however, was significantly lower than in retrospective patients. The number of radiation-induced breaks after in-vitro irradiation was comparable in lymphocytes of patients who showed no normal tissue reaction (n = 11) as compared to those with mild to moderate radiation reaction (n = 32, acute reactions Grade 1 to 2, late reactions Grade 0 to 2). In 9 patients with unexpected severe plus late Grade 3 to 4 reactions, however, a significantly higher number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks was measured; the highest number was observed in a patient with a radiation myelitis. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed, as expected, an extreme radiosensitivity of their lymphocytes. The number of breaks/mitosis after 0.7 Gy in vitro irradiation of lymphocytes was 0.103 +/- 0.059 in patients with no normal tissue radiation reaction (n = 11), 0.122 +/- 0.146 in the group with mild to moderate radiation reactions Grade 1 to 2 (n = 32), 0.359 + 0.226 in patients with unexpected Grade 3 to 4 normal tissue reactions (n = 9) and 0.550 +/- 0.243 in the 3 AT-homozygotes (p < 0.01, t-test). The difference in lymphocyte radiosensitivity between these 4 groups was also detected after in-vitro irradiation with 2 Gy (0.484 +/- 0.132 vs. 0.535 +/- 0.228 vs. 0.926 +/- 0.349 vs. 1.423 +/- 0.072).CONCLUSIONS: We found a significantly higher number of chromosomal breaks in lymphocytes of patients with severe or extreme radiation reaction of normal tissues as compared to patients with no or only mild to moderate radiation reactions. The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in these radiosensitive patients was in the range between normal radiosensitivity and the radiosensitivity of AT-homozygotes. Detection of patients with severely enhanced intrinsic radiosensitivity might be possible with this method.",Included
3106,"YKL-40 expression is associated with poorer response to radiation and shorter overall survival in glioblastoma. PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included

3135,"A mouse model replicating hippocampal sparing cranial irradiation in humans: A tool for identifying new strategies to limit neurocognitive decline. Cancer patients undergoing cranial irradiation are at risk of developing neurocognitive impairments. Recent evidence suggests that radiation-induced injury to the hippocampi could play an important role in this cognitive decline. As a tool for studying the mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline, we developed a mouse model replicating the results of the recent clinical RTOG 0933 study of hippocampal sparing whole-brain irradiation. We irradiated 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice to a single dose of 10 Gy using either whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) or hippocampal sparing irradiation (HSI). These animals, as well as sham-irradiated controls, were subjected to behavioral/cognitive assessments distinguishing between hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent functions. Irradiation was well tolerated by all animals and only limited cell death of proliferating cells was found within the generative zones. Animals exposed to WBRT showed significant deficits compared to sham-irradiated controls in the hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. In contrast, HSI mice did not perform significantly different from sham-irradiated mice (control group) and performed significantly better when compared to WBRT mice. This is consistent with the results from the RTOG 0933 clinical trial, and as such this animal model could prove a helpful tool for exploring new strategies for mitigating cognitive decline in cancer patients receiving cranial irradiation.",Included

PURPOSE: To elucidate with a histopathological study the mechanism of region-dependent volume effects in the partly irradiated parotid gland of the rat.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Wistar rats were locally X-irradiated with collimators with conformal radiation portals for 100% volume and 50% cranial/caudal partial volumes. Single doses up to 40 Gy were applied. Parotid saliva samples were collected, and the three lobes of the parotid gland were examined individually on the macro- and micromorphologic level up to 1 year after irradiation.RESULTS: Dose-dependent loss of gland weight was observed 1 year after total or partial X-irradiation. Weight loss of the glands correlated very well with loss of secretory function. Irradiating the cranial 50% volume (implicating a shielded lateral lobe) resulted in substantially more damage in terms of weight loss and loss of secretory function than 50% caudal irradiation (shielding the ventral and dorsal lobe). Histologic examinations of the glands 1 year after irradiation revealed that the shielded lateral lobe was severely affected, in contrast to the shielded ventral and dorsal lobes. Time studies showed that irradiation of the cranial 50% volume caused late development of secondary damage in the shielded lateral lobe, becoming manifest between 240 and 360 days after irradiation. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the observed region-dependent volume effect for late function loss in the rat parotid gland after partial irradiation is mainly caused by secondary events in the shielded lateral lobe. The most probable first step (primary radiation event) in the development of this secondary damage is radiation exposure to the hilus region (located between the ventral and dorsal lobe). By injuring major excretory ducts and supply routes for blood and nerves in this area, the facility system necessary for proper functioning of the nonexposed lateral lobe is seriously affected. The unexpected volume effect in the rat might have consequences for treatment strategies in radiotherapy, implicating not only salivary glands but also other organs with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of radiosensitive elements, a situation wherein volume effects have not been anticipated up to now.",Included
3207,"The role of radiation and chemotherapy in adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas: results from the National Cancer Database. INTRODUCTION: Surgical resection of high-grade brainstem gliomas is challenging and treatment mostly involves radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we utilized registry data to determine prognostic features and impact of chemotherapy and radiation on overall survival.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for adult cases with histologically confirmed high-grade brainstem glioma. Covariates including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and treatment parameters were captured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify predictors of survival.RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were analyzed. Most patients (66.6%) underwent postoperative radiation with chemotherapy, 9.2% underwent radiation alone, while the remaining had no postoperative treatment (24.2%). Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038).

Background: We sought to determine the surgical treatment and functional outcome and identify the predictors of survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal cord ependymoma using data collected from the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group database. Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. © 2013 The Author(s).",Included
3217,"Chronic pathophysiological changes in normal brain parenchyma raised after radiotherapy can accelerate the recurrence of glioma. INTRODUCTION: Tumor recurrence is a leading cause of cancer mortality. Currently, the standard treatment for glioblastoma is maximal surgical resection and concomitant chemoradiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy. However, this treatment offers a limited benefit, with a median progression-free survival of <7 months and a median overall survival of <15 months. Radiation-induced brain injury occurs in a normal brain following radiotherapy; it is described in terms of acute, early delayed and late delayed injury. The recurrence of glioblastoma usually occurs just around the same time as the early or late delayed phase of radiation injury. Our preliminary investigation has revealed that, at three months after X-ray irradiation, tumor-promoting miRNAs (Mir18a, Mir20a, Mir-92, Mir381, etc.) and cytokines (CCL2, CXCL10, SDF-1, Angpt2, etc.) are significantly up-regulated in the irradiated rat normal brain compared to the non-irradiated one. In the present study, therefore, we hypothesized that the pathophysiological changes in a normal brain parenchyma raised by radiotherapy may engage also in the tumor recurrence after the radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To explore above hypothesis, we transplanted rat glioblastoma cells (F98) into a rat brain to which X-ray had been irradiated in advance. Group 1: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to right cerebral hemisphere. Group 2: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to left cerebral hemisphere. Group 3: Sham irradiation was performed (control). 3 months after irradiation, 1x105 of F98 cells were stereotactically transplanted into the right cerebral hemisphere of each rat. RESULT(S): Rats in group 1 and 2 showed significantly shorter survival than rats in group 3 (p-value: 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Interestingly, there was no significant difference of survival between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.8). Histopathological analysis for the tumors revealed that MIB-1 labeling index was significantly higher in group 1 and 2 than in group 3. CONCLUSION(S): It has been reported that, at the tumor recurrence, a lot of mutations including driver ones has been induced and accumulated through chemoradiotherapy, which can promote the tumor regrowth. However, the proliferation capacity of glioblastoma cells significantly increased, even when they were transplanted into the brain previously irradiated. Furthermore, the fact that tumor growth in the non-irradiated cerebral hemisphere of irradiated rats was also accelerated compared to the control group, suggested that some sort of biofactors may spread from irradiated normal brain cells and can make an impact on tumor cells existing in the opposite brain hemisphere. Thus, the delayed radiation injury in normal brain parenchyma might include paradoxical role on the tumor recurrence not only from inside but also from outside the irradiation field.",Included

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes.METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation. Clinical decompensation, despite more extensive collateralization, may precipitate stroke in ORV.",Included

An additional lesion in one of these cats displayed high signal on T2-weighted images and enhanced on T1-weighted images after IV gadolinium-DTPA. Pathologic correlation revealed that the nonenhancing T2-weighted lesions consisted of edema or demyelinated regions without inflammation while the gadolinium-enhanced lesion demonstrated necrosis with inflammatory infiltrate.

Purpose(s): To assess the effect of gadodiamide and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) on T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of DN. Study Type: Single-center retrospective. Population: In all, 125 patients who underwent brain MRIs were classified into four groups: 1) patients who did neither receive intravenous GBCAs injections nor irradiation (controls); 2) patients having >=3 GBCAs-enhanced scans and no WBRT; 3) patients having WBRT and < 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans; and 4) patients having WBRT and >= 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T magnet, echo-planar diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted sequences. Assessment: The DN-to-pons SI ratio on unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and ADC values of the DN were calculated.

Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner.

The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation.",Included

This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm-/- mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53.

BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) irradiation has detrimental effects which become evident within hours to few days and after a long latency of months and years. However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE.

Histochemical study on carbohydrate metabolism and acid phosphatase activation]. The disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of acid phosphatases with and without protection by O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (HR) were studied in irradiated rat brains by means of the light microscope. The histochemically demonstrable deposition of glycogen and acid mucopolysaccharides serves as a criterion for a reversible lesion of the irradiated cerebral tissue. The extent of local activation of repair processes following to irradiation can be determined by the quantity of acid phosphatases in the lysosomes. For the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy, HR seems to exert a protective effect on the cellular metabolism of the irradiated cerebral tissue shown by a slight decrease of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide deposits compared to the untreated animals. However, when exceeding a threshold dose of 10 Gy, the deposition of carbohydrates in the HR group is strongly increased. A slightly increased activity of acid phosphatases induced by HR can be supposed at best for the dose range of 5 to 7.5 Gy. If the dose is even more increased, the reverse effect found in the carbohydrate metabolism, too, and an increased activation of acid phosphatases in the control group will be observed. This unexpected reversion of the protective effect could be related to the assumed inhibitory effect of HR on the ATPases and thus on the anaerobic part of glycolysis or to a breakdown of the cell interaction system of endothelial cells, glia cells, and neurons.",Included

In this work, we studied the influence of whole-body gamma irradiation (800 rads) upon malonaldehyde (MDA) content in plasma, erythrocyte, brain, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, thymus and bone marrow. MDA levels were increased in all studied samples, except lung; the highest increases were observed in the most radiosensitive organs (bone marrow, thymus, spleen) and not in those continuously exposed to high concentrations of molecular oxygen (lungs, erythrocytes). Comparison of the variations of MDA levels in plasma, kidneys and spleen to those in the other tissues lead to the hypothesis that MDA is released from tissues in plasma and trapped from plasma in kidney and spleen. The variations in plasma and erythrocyte were found not to be related to each other.",Included

The control group included 150 healthy people. Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included
3377,"Lipid alteration following proton beam irradiation in mouse brain of radiation necrosis model. INTRODUCTION: Brain radiation necrosis (RN) is irreversible severe adverse effect after radiation therapy for brain tumors over 60 Gy. Effective treatment for this irreversible event has not been established. The lying mechanism of RN is to be elucidated in order to establish a new therapy. We have established brain RN mouse model using proton beam at the Wakasa Wan Energy research Center. In this model, RN was induced 8 months after irradiation and the histology of the necrosis recapitulated the human RN patients [Kondo N.2015]. So far, some researchers investigated the mechanism of RN based on protein level. However, with the advanced mass spectrometry technology, lipid mediator response to ionizing radiation was reported [Laiakis EC, 2014]. Therefore, in this study, lipid alteration after proton beam irradiation was investigated in mouse brain RN model using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizing imaging mass spectrometry (HR-MALDI-IMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generation of mouse brain RN model: C57BL/6J mice were irradiated in the restricted area of right brain at 60 Gy using proton beam. Tissue preparation: After 4 months later mouse was sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with cold PBS. The brain was extracted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in-80degreeC. The brain was sliced to a thickness of 4 mum with a cryostat and placed onto an indium tin oxide coated glass slide and stored at-20 degreeC until matrix application and subsequent HR-MALDI-IMS analysis. Each slide was anchored in vacuum deposition equipment and coated with 9-aminoacridine hemihydrates (9-AA) matrix layer obtained by sublimation at 220degreeC. The sequential sections were mounted onto glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis: HR-MALDI-IMS analysis was performed on a high-resolution microscopic imaging mass spectrometer (iMScope; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry data were acquired in negative and positive mode in the mass range of m/z 700-1000. Statistical Analysis: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed by Imaging MS Solution (ver 1, 12, 26; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). RESULT(S): Compared to non-irradiated area, in the irradiated right hemisphere, i) elevation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (34:1, 36:4, 36:1, 38:6, 40:6) and ii) decline of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (36:4, 38:4) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): The data indicated the phospholipid alterations after irradiation in mouse brain RN model in the chronic phase before establishment of RN. Further analysis for component of these phospholipids may include the precursor of lipid mediator, arachidonic acid (AA) or other fatty acids. We will investigate time-dependent change of phospholipids using mouse brain RN model and HR-MALDI-IMS analysis then finally find the responsible lipid mediators which induce brain RN.",Included
3400,"Localization dependent sensitivity of cerebral Na,K-ATPase to irradiation induced oxidative imbalance in rats. Na,K-ATPase represents the key enzyme maintaining the ionic gradient across plasma membrane. It was documented that in directly irradiated organs the activity of this enzyme is decreased. The aim of present study was to clarify the remote effect of irradiation in mediastinal area on the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in selected brain regions in rats. Ionizing radiation in single dose 25 Gy induced alterations in oxidative status of blood plasma. Irradiation also decreased the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in cerebral cortex. Measurements of kinetic properties of the enzyme dependently on the concentration of energy substrate ATP or cofactor Na<sup>+</sup> indicated that the lowered enzyme activity is probably a consequence of decreased number of active molecules of the enzyme, as suggested by lowered V<sub>max</sub> values (by 13 - 14%). Immunoblot analysis revealed that this effect is connected namely to decreased presence of alpha2 and alpha3 subunits (by 25% and 30% respectively). Considering the current concepts about involvement of the malfunction of alpha2 alpha3 subunits in development of primary brain dysfunctions, it may be hypothesized that the lowered functionality of those subunits of Na,K-ATPase may represent a predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders after irradiation. The observed effect seems to be localization dependent as the enzyme in cerebellum resisted to irradiation.",Included

Plots of 'degeneration scores' (counts of profiles in 29 areas) vs. dose for the proton and electron irradiations displayed a linear dose response for protons in the range of 2-8 Gy. In the 20-100 Gy range, for both electrons and protons the points were distributed in a broad band suggesting a saturation curve. The dose range in which these astrocyte-like profiles becomes maximal corresponds well with the dose range for the X-ray eradication of a subtype of astrocytes, 'beta astrocytes'.",Included

Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty-eight 45-day-old Wistar rats received whole brain fractionated radiation (30 Gy), whereas 48 rats received sham irradiation. Four irradiated subgroups were defined: saline, 37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg Ethyol. Sequential behavioral studies including one-way and two-way avoidance tasks were undertaken before and after radiation. Result(s): Before radiation, the performances of all groups were similar. For the one-way avoidance task, at 1, 3, and 6 months postradiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (75 or 150 mg/kg) irradiated rats (p <= 0.001). Nevertheless, lower percentage of avoidance (p <= 0.001) was only seen at 1 month postradiation in saline-irradiated rats, after comparison with their preradiation values. For the two-way avoidance task, performed only after radiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (150 or 75 mg/kg) irradiated rats at 1, 2.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months (p = 0.000). Rats treated with Ethyol did not differ from sham-irradiated rats in both avoidance tasks, except for the 37.5 mg/kg-Ethyol group which showed lower performances 6 months postradiation (p = 0.005, one-way avoidance). Conclusion(s): Treatment with 75 or 150 mg/kg of Ethyol prevents radiation-induced learning and transitory memory dysfunction in young rats. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.",Included

Background: In the absence of specific protection, invasive cardiologists receive a high lifetime head exposure, with organ doses in the 1 to 3 Sievert range (equivalent to the risk of 50,000 to 150,000 chest x-rays). Radiation exposure in this dose range can reduce neurogenesis in adult brain and negatively impact on olfactory function, whose impairment is a recognized early biomarker of neurode-generative disease. Aim(s): To assess psychological testing results in exposed subjects (ES) working as staff in the Cath Lab compared with non-exposed matched controls (NES). Method(s): A complete olfactory test battery (Sniffin' Sticks Extended test) was performed in 130 Cath Lab ES (60 males; age=44.9+/-8.7 years; 58 interventional cardiologists, 60 nurses, 12 technicians). A control group of age- and gendermatched non-exposed subjects (NES) was also studied.

INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included

Radiotherapeutic treatment consists of targeted application of radiation beams to a tumor but exposure of surrounding healthy tissue is inevitable. In the brain, ionizing radiation induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier by effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. Damage from directly irradiated cells can be transferred to surrounding non-exposed bystander cells, known as the radiation-induced bystander effect. We investigated involvement of connexin channels and paracrine signaling in radiation-induced bystander DNA damage in brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to focused X-rays. Irradiation caused DNA damage in the directly exposed area, which propagated over several millimeters in the bystander area. DNA damage was significantly reduced by the connexin channel-targeting peptide Gap26 and the Cx43 hemichannel blocker TAT-Gap19. ATP release, dye uptake, and patch clamp experiments showed that hemichannels opened within 5 min post irradiation in both irradiated and bystander areas. Bystander signaling involved cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and IP<inf>3</inf>, ATP, ROS, and NO signaling, with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, IP<inf>3</inf>, and ROS as crucial propagators of DNA damage.

Wistar rats were exposed to 10, 20 and 40 sGy of gamma-irradiation. Maximal activity of 2-oxoglutarate- and succinate dehydrogenases, as well as of aspartate-2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate-2-oxoglutarate in the brain tissue was measured within 30 days after the exposure. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in the brain cortex, limbic system and in the cerebellum; transaminase activity was determined in the brain cortex, diencephalic zone and in the hypophysis. It was found that small doses of irradiation resulted in an oscillating increase of dehydrogenase activity with a decrease of the amplitude by the 30th day of the experiment. As the dose of irradiation increases, the periods of normal activity change into phases of inhibition of dehydrogenase action, the period of oscillations diminishes. Transaminase activity, as a rule, changes in a phase in a reversible manner as compared with dehydrogenase activity. These observations are discussed from the point of view of structural relations between these two systems in the intramitochondrial supramolecular structures, the so-called metabolons.",Included

Mechanical injury to the adult mammalian spinal cord results in permanent loss of structural integrity at the lesion site and of the brain-controlled function distal to the lesion. Some of these consequences were permanently averted by altering the cellular constituents at the lesion site with x-irradiation delivered within a critical time window after injury. We have reported in a separate article that x-irradiation of sectioned adult rat spinal cord resulted in restitution of structural continuity and regrowth of severed corticospinal axons across and deep into the distal stump. Here, we report that after x-ray therapy of the lesion site severed corticospinal axons of transected adult rat spinal cord recover electrophysiologic control of activity of hindlimb muscles innervated by motoneurons distal to the lesion. The degree of recovery of control of muscle activity was directly related to the degree of restitution of structural integrity. This restitution of electrophysiologic function implies that the regenerating corticospinal axons reestablish connectivity with neurons within the target field in the distal stump. Our data suggest that recovery of structural continuity is a sufficient condition for the axotomized corticospinal neurons to regain some of their disrupted function in cord regions distal to the lesion site.",Included

3201,"Circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates melanogenesis through MITF. The circadian clock is near ubiquitous, self-sustaining, and oscillates with a periodic cycle of about 24 hr. The skin circadian clock is known to be involved in various important cellular pathways including cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair, and metabolism by regulating the expression of specific target genes known as the clock-controlled genes (CCGs). In this study, we show that Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), an essential rate-limiting protein in melanin biosynthesis, is a transcriptional target of the circadian clock. Using primary human melanocytes, human melanoma cells and mouse skin tissues, we have established transcriptional regulation of MITF by the circadian clock, which translates into rhythmic 24 hr expression of MITF mRNA and protein levels. We also show that the circadian clock protein Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (BMAL1) is a positive regulator of MITF, which causes an increase in melanin levels. Further, we demonstrate that upon exposure to solar UV-B radiation in presence of BMAL1, there is reduced gammaH2AX and cleaved PARP level compared to BMAL1 deficient group, which contributes to enhanced cell viability and survival. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the novel regulation of MITF by BMAL1 provides better protection against solar UV-B mediated genomic instability and melanomagenesis.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present no pathologic tissue, and radiation dose is confined in a clear targeted volume. The authors retrospectively evaluated the role of the biologically effective dose (BED) after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for brain AVMs. METHODS A total of 149 consecutive cases of unruptured AVMs treated by upfront GKRS in Lille University Hospital, France, were included. The mean length of follow-up was 52.9 months (median 48, range 12-154 months). The primary outcome was obliteration, and the secondary outcome was complication appearance. The marginal dose was 24 Gy in a vast majority of cases (n = 115, 77.2%; range 18-25 Gy). The mean BED was 220.1 Gy<inf>2.47</inf> (median 229.9, range 106.7-246.8 Gy<inf>2.47</inf>). The mean beam-on time was 32.3 minutes (median 30.8, range 9-138.7 minutes). In the present series, the mean radiation dose rate was 2.259 Gy/min (median 2.176, range 1.313-3.665 Gy/min). The Virginia score was 0 in 29 (19.5%), 1 in 61 (40.9%), 2 in 41 (27.5%), 3 in 18 (12.1%), and 4 in 0 (0%) patients, respectively. The mean Pollock-Flickinger score was 1.11 (median 1.52, range 0.4-2.9). Univariate (for obliteration and complication appearance) and multivariate (for obliteration only) analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 104 AVMs (69.8%) were obliterated at the last follow-up. The strongest predictor for obliteration was BED (p = 0.03). A radiosurgical obliteration score is proposed, derived from a fitted multivariable model: (0.018 x BED) + (1.58 x V12) + (-0.013689 x beam-on time) + (0.021 x age) - 4.38. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7438; after internal validation using bootstrap methods, it was 0.7088. No statistically significant relationship between radiation dose rate and obliteration was found (p = 0.29). Twenty-eight (18.8%) patients developed complications after GKRS; 20 (13.4%) of these patients had transient adverse radiological effects (perilesional edema developed). Predictors for complication appearance were higher prescription isodose volume (p = 0.005) and 12-Gy isodose line volume (V12; p = 0.001), higher Pollock-Flickinger (p = 0.02) and Virginia scores (p = 0.003), and lower beam-on time (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The BED was the strongest predictor of obliteration of unruptured AVMs after upfront GKRS. A radiosurgical score comprising the BED is proposed. The V12 appears as a predictor for both efficacy and toxicity. Beam-on time was illustrated as statistically significant for both obliteration and complication appearance. The radiation dose rate did not influence obliteration in the current analysis. The exact BED threshold remains to be established by further studies.

Fear-related freezing behavior after FS stimulation occurred similarly in both treated groups, whereas the behavior observed during exposure to CFC significantly reduced in 5-HT-lesioned rats.

Result(s): Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia. Conclusion(s): We present a series of advanced breast cancer patients treated prophylactically with whole-brain radiotherapy following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. Although the therapeutic benefit of PCI is not ascertainable here, we describe brain metastases occurring despite PCI and serious long-term neurobehavioral sequelae in PCI-treated patients. Any further investigation of PCI in high-risk breast cancer will need to be approached with caution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
497,"Use of human mesenchymal stem cell treatment to prevent anhedonia in a rat model of traumatic brain injury. PURPOSE: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded
3099,"The Mayo Clinic gamma knife experience: indications and initial results. OBJECTIVE: To review the results and expectations of contemporary stereotactic radiosurgery.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,033 consecutive patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 1990 and January 1998.RESULTS: The number of patients undergoing radiosurgery increased from 57 in 1990 to 216 in 1997. Of 97 patients with arteriovenous malformations who underwent follow-up angiography 2 years or more after a single radiosurgical procedure, 72 (74%) had complete obliteration of the vascular malformation. Of 209 patients who underwent radiosurgery for benign tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, or pituitary adenomas) and had radiologic studies after 2 years or more of follow-up, tumor growth control was noted in 200 (96%). Tumor growth was also controlled in 90% of brain metastatic lesions at a median of 7 months after radiosurgery. Of 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia and follow-up for more than 2 months, 14 (70%) were free of pain after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective management strategy for a wide variety of intracranial disorders. Use of radiosurgical treatment should continue to increase as more data become available on the long-term results of this procedure.",Excluded

Combination therapy using anticancer drugs and nucleic acid is a more promising strategy to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer and to enhance apoptosis. In this study, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), which contain both pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-21), have been developed for treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Prepared LPNs have been well characterized by particle size distribution and zeta potential measurements, determination of encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release experiments. Morphology of LPNs was determined by transmission electron microscopy. LPNs had a hydrodynamic size below 100 nm and exhibited sustained release of pemetrexed up to 10 h. Encapsulation of pemetrexed in LPNs increased cellular uptake from 6% to 78%. Results of confocal microscopy analysis have shown that co-delivery of anti-miR-21 significantly improved accumulation of LPNs in the nucleus of U87MG cells. Nevertheless, more effective cytotoxicity results could not be obtained due to low concentration of anti-miR-21, loaded in LPNs. We expect that the effective drug delivery systems can be obtained with higher concentration of anti-miR-21 for the treatment of glioblastoma.

160,"Effects of near-infra-red laser irradiation on adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate contents of rat brain tissue. Low-power, near-infra-red laser irradiation has been used to relieve patients from various kinds of pain, though the precise mechanisms of such biological actions of the laser have not yet been resolved. To investigate the cellular mechanisms by near-infra-red laser on the nervous system, we examined the effect of 830-nm laser irradiation on the energy metabolism of the rat brain. The diode laser was applied for 15 min with an irradiance of 4.8 W/cm(2). Tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content of the irradiated area in the cerebral cortex was 19% higher than that of the non-treated area, whereas the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content showed no significant difference. Laser irradiation at another wavelength (652 nm) had no effect on either ATP or ADP contents. The temperature of the tissue was increased by 4.4-4.7 degrees C during the irradiation of both wavelengths. These results suggest that the increase in tissue ATP content did not result from the thermal effect, but from a specific effect of the laser operated at the 830-nm wavelength.",Excluded
3263,"Monitoring of mental performance during spaceflight. Mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight may suffer from both direct effects of microgravity on perceptual, cognitive, and psychomotor processes, and unspecific stress effects on these functions due to high workload sleep disturbances, or the general burden of adapting to the extreme living conditions in space. Early detection of any signs of mental performance impairments seems to be essential for mission success and to prevent obvious performance decrements in critical mission tasks. One possible approach to this problem is to assess the astronaut's performance on specific screening tests repeatedly during a space mission and to compare the results with a self-referenced baseline established pre-flight. The selection of screening tests for this purpose should be guided by three different criteria: 1) their reliability; 2) their sensitivity (i.e., their power to reveal subtle mental performance changes induced by internal or external stressors during spaceflight); and 3) their diagnosticity (i.e., their capability to reveal the underlying processes that lead to these performance deficits). Based on a discussion of these theoretical issues, first attempts to monitor mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight by means of short-term laboratory tasks are reviewed. The results of these studies suggest that, in particular, perceptual-motor tasks (tracking) and tasks placing comparatively high demands on attentional processes (e.g., dual-tasks) represent sensitive monitoring measures. First studies on the diagnositicity of tracking performance decrements during spaceflight suggest that they reflect both microgravity-related changes in the sensory-motor system as well as unspecific stress-effects, with the former factor reflected primarily in tracking performance decrements during early adaptation to the microgravity environment.

576,"Heavy-ion microbeam system at JAEA-Takasaki for microbeam biology. Research concerning cellular responses to low dose irradiation, radiation-induced bystander effects, and the biological track structure of charged particles has recently received particular attention in the field of radiation biology. Target irradiation employing a microbeam represents a useful means of advancing this research by obviating some of the disadvantages associated with the conventional irradiation strategies. The heavy-ion microbeam system at JAEA-Takasaki, which was planned in 1987 and started in the early 1990's, can provide target irradiation of heavy charged particles to biological material at atmospheric pressure using a minimum beam size 5 mum in diameter. A variety of biological material has been irradiated using this microbeam system including cultured mammalian and higher plant cells, isolated fibers of mouse skeletal muscle, silkworm (Bombyx mori) embryos and larvae, Arabidopsis thaliana roots, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The system can be applied to the investigation of mechanisms within biological organisms not only in the context of radiation biology, but also in the fields of general biology such as physiology, developmental biology and neurobiology, and should help to establish and contribute to the field of ""microbeam biology"".",Excluded
675,"Radiotherapy of maxillary cancer using 9 equi-spaced beam coplanar beam arrangement and 9 non-coplanar beam arrangement with beam angle optimization - A dosimetric comparison. Background: IMRT is a novel radiotherapy that can deliver high conformal homogeneous dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding tissues and structures. Conventional routine IMRT usually uses equi-spaced beam arrangement of 5 to 9. However, in recent development, manipulating the beam arrangement of IMRT is offered in beam angle optimization (BAO), in which it automatically chooses optimized beam angles in either coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements. In Pugachev et al. (2001) study it has been suggested that improvement of the dose distribution was seen in complicated head and neck cancer cases with BAO. Nevertheless, opposite opinion has been raised by Stein et al. (1997) which stated that the marginal gain by manipulating beam angle diminished when there are more than 7 beams. Notwithstanding the controversy in study results, it was observed that careful selection of beam orientation contributed to a better dose distribution in the final treatment plan in clinical experience. This study is to investigate the dosimetric effect of manipulating beam angles with BAO in maxillary cancer cases compared with 9 equi-spaced beam co-planar arrangement. Method(s): The subjects in this study were recruited from the Princess Margaret Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the period of 1st Jan 2006 to 31st Dec 2010. Planning computed tomography (CT) images of the samples were retrospectively restored. Five samples were recruited using random sampling. It was an experimental study to test the effect of using equispaced beams, BAO and VMAT in IMRT. The parameters for comparison are tumour dose conformity, homogeneity; and the OARs maximum, mean dose. 2 plans were produced for each recruited patients. One using 9 equispaced beam arrangement and the other using 9 non-coplanar field using BAO. Result(s): For the five recruited patients, both 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement and BAO resulted in clinically satisfactory dose distribution and were of similar quality. It was found that IMRT plans with BAO resulted in better OARs sparing, including the parotid, cochlear, eyes, optic nerves, the optic chiasm and brain stem. In terms of target coverage, 4 out of 5 plans produced better in BAO when compared with 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement. Conclusion(s): The effect of the selection of beam angle orientations was significant within the samples. The choice of beam orientations is a factor affecting the dosimetric outcome even when the beam number is equal to 9.",Excluded
716,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC. For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The reliability of post-implant dosimetry in the OR depends on the geometrical variability of implant and anatomy after the procedure. The purpose was to gain detailed information on seed displacement patterns in different sectors of the prostate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 33 patients with stranded seed implants the seed geometry and the dose distribution were compared between the situation in the OR just after the procedure, based on ultrasound images, and the situation after 1month, based on registered CT and MR images.RESULTS: There was a substantial displacement of ventral seeds of 3.8+/-2.5mm in caudal direction (p<0.001). Of these ventral seeds cranially located seeds moved more than caudally located seeds, 4.5+/-2.7mm and 2.9+/-2.6mm, respectively (p<0.001).

Objective: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of socioeconomic status on this health burden.Methods: National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).Results: Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for interaction = 0.047).Conclusion: Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in developing countries with high-UVR exposure.",Excluded
3007,"Topiramate and cortical excitability in humans: a study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered at 5 Hz frequency and suprathreshold intensity progressively increases the size of muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) and the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of topiramate (TPM) at different doses on cortical excitability variables tested with rTMS. We tested the facilitation of the MEP size and CSP duration evoked by focal rTMS in eight patients before and after treatment with TPM at different doses for chronic neuropathic pain. In each patient, rTMS (5 Hz frequency-120% resting motor threshold) was applied at baseline and during the TPM induction phase (drug intake schedule: week I 25 mg/day, week II 50 mg/day, week III 75 mg/day, week IV 100 mg/day) and total TPM plasma concentrations were measured. The effects on the MEP size of 5 Hz-rTMS delivered over repeated sessions were tested in eight control subjects. TPM had no effect on the resting motor threshold. Antiepileptic treatment at increasing doses abolished the normal rTMS-induced MEP facilitation. ANOVA showed that this was a dose-related effect. Accordingly, in patients receiving TPM at higher doses (75 and 100 mg) rTMS failed to elicit the MEP facilitation. TPM left the progressive lengthening of the CSP during the rTMS train unchanged. In control subjects, rTMS applied over repeated sessions elicited a constant increase in MEP size. Our results suggest that TPM modulates the excitatory intracortical interneurons probably by altering rTMS-induced synaptic potentiation. These drug-induced effects are related to TPM doses and plasma concentrations. In conclusion, rTMS may be useful for quantifying the effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs and for assessing individual responses to different drugs but acting through similar mechanisms, thus combining functional neurophysiological information and laboratory data.",Excluded

3143,"Thalamic energy dysregulation drives microstructural changes of thalamocortical projections in multiple sclerosis. Background and aims: Neuronal energy dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed as a key driver of axonal degeneration. Diffusion-weighted 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) can measure the diffusivity of creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr/PhCr), whose reduction in the MS thalamus has been proposed to reflect limited energy reserves. We tested in-vivo whether thalamic energy dysregulation is associated with microstructural degeneration of its projection tracts in MS. Method(s): Seventeen patients and thirteen healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3T MRI scan including DW-MRS and DW sequences. From DW-MRS, Cr apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(tCr)) was extracted in the bilateral thalami. Thalamic projections to somatosensory, dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes and optic radiations (case tracts) and the arcuate (non-thalamic control tract) were manually drawn in TrackVis (Fig.1). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), reflecting microstructural damage, were extracted for each tract. Associations between ADC(tCr) and microstructural parameters were tested using linear mixed-effect models. (Figure presented) Results: In MS, lower thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with lower mean FA and higher mean MD of pooled thalamo-cortical tracts after adjusting for disease duration, gender and tract-specific lesion load (p=0.033 and p=0.047). No correlation was found in HCs. Unadjusted tract-by-tract analysis confirmed the correlation between thalamic ADC(tCr) and MD in patients. The arcuate tract, not connected to the thalamus, showed no correlation (Fig.2). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with specific microstructural damage of thalamo-cortical tracts in MS, suggesting that energy dysfunction in this crucial hub - through an impaired Cr/PhCr transport/utilization - may disrupt thalamo-cortical networks by inducing the selective anterograde degeneration of connected fibers.",Excluded

Introduction: Due to a relative low incidence of spinal ependymomas in adults, a definitive therapeutic strategy is still missing. Therefore, different concepts are under discussion without a uniform standard of therapy and diagnostics. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated all spinal ependymomas treated surgically from 03/2006 until 05/2012 at our department. This consecutive, retrospective series includes 41 patients: 23 female, 18 male, median age 51 y. (range 21-80). 22 Ependymomas were located intramedullary, 18 within cauda equina or filum terminale, 1 patient presented with multifocal spinal lesions including both, intramedullar and extramedullar lesions. Perioperative standard diagnostic of most tumors included a holospinal MRI and a CSF cytology. First follow-up MRI and exam was done 3 months postoperatively, further controls every year in case of stable findings. Current median follow-up is 29 months (range 3-72). Preoperative, early postoperative and follow-up clinical performance was evaluated according to the modified McCormick scale. Postoperative deterioration was dichotomized in ""slight"" (=deterioration without any increase of the modified McCormick scale grades or an increase in only one grade within the scale range 1-2) and ""significant"" (=increase to grade 7ge;3 on the modified McCormick scale). Result(s): Preoperatively, the vast majority presented neurologically intact or with mild deficits maintaining functional independence according to the modified McCormick scale. The most common preoperative symptom was pain (78%), followed by sensory deficits (54%), gait ataxia (34%), motor deficits (27%), and bowel/bladder dysfunction (12%).

Immediately after surgery 24% (n=10) showed worsening of neurological symptoms, but in most cases only mild new deficits occurred. During follow up 78% (n=32) showed at least preop status, 37% (n=15) improved. In only 5% (n=2) a permanent significant deterioration remained. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed after the first surgery in two cases: in one patient with drop metastasis after the GTR of the main tumour, and in another patient with multifocal lesions after debulking, both were WHOdegreeII ependymomas. Tumour recurrence was seen in 4 cases, so far: 3 WHOdegreeII, 1 WHOdegreeI, 2 of them despite previous GTR and 1 despite adjuvant radiation. Median progression free survival was 22 months (range 6-43). 2 patients died of meningeosis 19 and 31 months after the initial diagnosis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Gross-total resection still stays the main column of ependymoma therapy. In our series this could be achieved in 85% accompanied by a rate of 5% for significant persistent deficits. In cases of incomplete resection stereotactic radiotherapy as well as a wait and see srategy can be considered. In case of disseminated disease holospinal radiation with a boost to the primary tumour site is recommended. Due to the risk of recurrence, close follow up with clinical and imaging examinations are mandatory.",Excluded

The in vivo biodistribution profile of the novel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR radioligand 5-[I-125/123]Iodo-3(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine, [I-125/123]-5-IA, in mouse brain was examined. This radiotracer displayed good brain penetration (3.1% of the injected dose (ID) in whole brain at 15 min post-radioligand injection). Radioligand distribution was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus (14.9 %ID/g at 60 min), moderate uptake in cortex (8.5 %ID/g at 60 min), and lowest uptake in the cerebellum (2.4 %ID/g at 60 min). Pretreatment with several different nAChR agonists (A-85380, (-)-nicotine, cytisine) significantly inhibited [I-125]-5-IA binding in all brain regions studied (P < 0.01) demonstrating the high specificity of the radioligand for nAChRs. Blocking doses of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the non-competitive nAChR channel blocker mecamylamine had no significant effect on radioactive uptake supporting the in vitro selectivity of [I-125]-5-IA for the nAChR component of the cholinergic system. [I-125]-5-IA binding sites were shown to be saturable with unlabeled 5-IA. With a relatively low acute toxicity (LD50 > 3 mg/kg via intravenous injection in mice) and high in vivo specificity and selectivity, 5-IA labeled with the imaging radionuclide I-123 may Drove useful for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies of nAChRs in human subjects.",Excluded
1048,"Involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPMEG in motor learning and cerebellar long-term depression. Although protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is important for hippocampus-dependent learning, its role in cerebellum-dependent learning remains unclear. We previously found that PTPMEG, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs), bound to the carboxyl-terminus of the glutamate receptor delta2 via the postsynaptic density-95/discs-large/ZO-1 domain of PTPMEG. In the present study, we generated PTPMEG-knockout (KO) mice, and addressed whether PTPMEG is involved in cerebellar plasticity and cerebellum-dependent learning. The structure of the cerebellum in PTPMEG-KO mice appeared grossly normal. However, we found that PTPMEG-KO mice showed severe impairment in the accelerated rotarod test. These mice also exhibited impairment in rapid acquisition of the cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, in which conditioned stimulus (450-ms tone) and unconditioned stimulus (100-ms periorbital electrical shock) were co-terminated. Moreover, long-term depression at parallel fiber-PC synapses was significantly attenuated in these mice. Developmental elimination of surplus climbing fibers and the physiological properties of excitatory synaptic inputs to PCs appeared normal in PTPMEG-KO mice. These results suggest that tyrosine dephosphorylation events regulated by PTPMEG are important for both motor learning and cerebellar synaptic plasticity.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate the impact of a neutron beam formed with the accelerator-based epithermal neutron source designed at the G.I. Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) on the viability of human and animal tumor cells cultured in the presence of boron-10 isotope.Material and Methods: Human U251 and T98G glioma cells and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells were incubated at various concentrations in the culture medium containing 10B-enriched L-boronophenylalanine. The cells were irradiated with a neuron beam using the accelerator-based epithermal neuron source. A clonogenic assay was used to evaluate the viability of the irradiated cells. The absorbed doses obtained from elastic scattering of fast neutrons by substance nuclei and the doses obtained from boron neutron capture were calculated using the NMS code. The absorbed doses of gamma-radiation were measured with a mixed radiation dosimeter.Results: The viability of boron-containing and intact human U251 and T98G cell lines and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells was analyzed after neutron beam radiation. Irradiation of all four cell lines were cultured in the presence of 10B was shown to reduce their colony-forming capacity compared with the control. Elevated boron levels in the culture medium resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of survived cells. Radiation had the most pronounced impact on the proliferative capacity of the human U251 glioma cell lines.Conclusion: The cultures of human tumor cells and mammalian cells demonstrated that the neutron beam formed with the accelerator-based epithermal neutron source designed at the INP, was effective in reducing the viability of tumor cells in the presence of 10B.",Excluded

3072,"Stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus provokes the initiation of robust long-term potentiation of the thalamo-cortical input to the barrel field of the adult, freely moving rat. Long-term potentiation in the thalamo-cortical input to the somatosensory cortex barrel field has been reported to be inducible in vitro only during a narrow critical period of the first postnatal week. Here we explored whether this is due to inability of adult synapses to express LTP or lack of appropriate conditions for LTP induction in slice preparations. We recorded thalamo-cortical field potentials (FPs) from the barrel field of chronically prepared adult rats. In the first series, several parameters of conditioning tetanization of thalamus (T) have been tried. Statistically significant LTP of 135-150% relative to the baseline was observed only in rare cases (3/18) so that the mean changes were not statistically significant. In the second series, five trains of 100 Hz stimulation of T were paired with a ""reinforcing"" stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In most cases (9/13), thalamo-cortical FPs were potentiated. The mean post-tetanic amplitude was 238 +/- 42% (+/- SEM) relative to the baseline (n = 13). The potentiation persisted for >1 h and typically even further increased when tested 24-48 h later. LTP magnitude strongly correlated with the initial paired-pulse ratio (PPR, coefficient of correlation r = 0.98) so that the LTP magnitude was larger (333 +/- 107, n = 6) in cases with PPR > 1.3. The mean PPR tended to decrease after LTP (from 2.05 to 1.65). Altogether the results suggest that LTP is inducible in the thalamo-cortical input to the barrel field of normal adult rats. The dependence of the LTP magnitude upon the initial PPR suggests that inputs with low initial release probability undergo larger LTP. Together with the tendency to a decrease in the PPR this suggests an involvement of presynaptic mechanisms in the maintenance of neocortical LTP.",Excluded
894,"Conventional radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide for malignant gliomas. High grade malignant gliomas are among the most radioresistant human tumors and total doses up to 80 Gy are inadequate to achieve long-term local control in most of the patients. Hypoxia has been demonstrated in primary brain tumors and may be one of the reasons for their radioresistance. In experimental models carbogen breathing and nicotinamide have been shown to act against hypoxia by different mechanisms and both modalities were tested in 16 patients with supratentorial malignant gliomas in combination with a conventional radiotherapy scheme (50 Gy in 25 daily fractions). The present study was performed to determine the feasibility and toxicity of conventional radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide. The unexpectedly high incidence of acute liver toxicity, the possible increase of subacute and late CNS toxicity, and the absence of a higher effectivity led us to reconsider this new treatment modality for patients with malignant gliomas.",Excluded
1237,"Gravity and Mastoid Effusion. BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic mastoid effusions have recently been observed in astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight. In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6degree head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response.METHODS: The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest.RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control).CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions. Formation of mastoid effusions during head down tilt bed rest is not prevented by daily 30 minutes short-arm intermittent or continuous centrifugation.",Excluded

3539,"Monte Carlo dosimetry calculation for boron neutron capture therapy in the treatment of brain tumors. The pathology of malignant brain tumors often precludes successful treatment by surgery and standard radiation therapy. Boron neutron capture therapy consists of the selective loading of tumor with <sup>10</sup>B and subsequent irradiation with a thermal or epithermal neutron field. The neutron capture reaction <sup>10</sup>B(n,a)<sup>7</sup>Li produces high linear energy transfer charged particles that deposit energy principally within the abnormal tissue that contains a high <sup>10</sup>B concentration. Constraints on this therapy modality are imposed by radiation effects in normal tissue from thermal neutrons, neutron induced gamma rays, fast neutron and gamma ray beam contaminants, and also from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,a)<sup>7</sup>Li reactions in circulating blood. The ANDY general geometry Monte Carlo code is used to calculate the space energy distribution of all pertinent components of the dose within a simple head phantom in an idealized therapy configuration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor. The effects of <sup>10</sup>B concentration, gamma ray contamination of the therapy beam, thermal neutron beam aperture, and surgically formed re entrant cavities are examined with respect to several clinical criteria for therapeutic efficacy. It is found for the model considered that the maximum effective relaxation length for the thermal neutron fluence is 1.6 to 1.8 cm, which is 30 to 40% lower than the infinite medium relaxation length, and thereby indicated the importance of multidimensional boundary effects in this calculation. The fluence depth characteristic was verified by an experimental irradiation of a tissue equivalent head phantom with re entrant cavity, and excellent agreement was observed between measured and calculated results. It was also found that the gamma ray beam contaminant is not necessarily deleterious to therapeutic efficacy, that a larger aperture thermal neutron beam improves the dose field with respect to some criteria but at the expense of others, and that plausible size variations in the surgically formed cavity do not change the character of the dose field. As a further refinement, a Monte Carlo microdosimetry model is developed and applied to the problem of radiation effects on the cerebral microvasculature by <sup>10</sup>B capture reactions in the circulating blood. Qualitative predictions of this model correlate positively with previous clinical experience.",Excluded
2218,"Gliosarcoma in the IDH era: Imaging characteristics of 25 patients with correlative immunostaining. Background: In the 2016 World Health Organizations Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, gliosarcoma (GSC) is considered a variant of IDH-wild type glioblastoma (GBM) characterized by a biphasic pattern with alternating areas exhibiting glial and mesenchymal differentiation. GSC can be primary or radiation-induced and is an intra-axial brain lesion which often abuts a dural surface. While some GSC have indistinguishable imaging characteristics from glioblastoma, aggressive lesions can erode through the dura and skull and involve the extra-cranial soft tissues. We present the largest known imaging series of GSC with immunohistochemical and histologic correlation, documenting them as IDH(-) and delineating their imaging spectrum. Method(s): Pathology proved GSC cases were collected from our quaternary care center spanning the last 16 years. IDH status was either documented or obtained by staining tissue blocks. When available, p53, PTEN, MIB-1, EGFR amplification status, and MGMT methylation status were recorded and imaging findings tabulated. Result(s): 25 cases were identified, 21 were De novo, and 4 were radiation-induced. All lesions contacted a dural or pial surface. All cases were negative for an IDH R132H mutation, including post-radiation GSC. 16/16 cases showed non-amplification of EGFR/CEP7. MGMT methylation was present in 2/17.

Multivariate logistic analysis was used to identify independent risk factors. A total of 864 patients underwent craniotomies for primary brain tumors, but 65 were excluded due to insufficient followup or incomplete records. We identified 30 patients with SSI (3.8%).

During the latter part of this time period, we initiated a program of intraoperative topical vancomycin application. We observed a significant reduction in SSI among those receiving topical vancomycin compared to those without (0.8% vs 4.9%, p<0.001). The cohorts were similar in demographics and baseline comorbidities, KPS, tumor characteristics, and surgical factors.

412,"Imaging the back pain patient. Imaging is an integral part of the clinical examination of the patient with back pain; it is, however, often used excessively and without consideration of the underlying literature. The primary role of imaging is the identification of systemic disease as a cause of the back or limb pain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels at this. Systemic disease as a cause of back or limb pain is, however, rare. Most back and radiating limb pain is of benign nature, owing to degenerative phenomena. There is no role for imaging in the initial evaluation of the patient with back pain in the absence of signs or symptoms of systemic disease. When conservative care fails, imaging may be undertaken with due consideration of its risks: labeling the patient as suffering from a degenerative disease, cost, radiation exposure, and provoking unwarranted minimally invasive or surgical intervention. Imaging can well depict disc degeneration and disc herniation. Imaging can suggest the presence of discogenic pain, but the lack of a pathoanatomic gold standard obviates any definitive conclusions. The imaging natural history of disc herniation is resolution. There is very poor correlation between imaging findings of disc herniation and the clinical presentation or course. Psychosocial factors predict functional disability due to disc herniation better than imaging. Imaging with MRI, computed tomography (CT), or CT myelography can readily identify central canal, lateral recess, or foraminal compromise. Only when an imaging finding is concordant with the patient's pain pattern or neurologic deficit can causation be considered. The zygapophysial (facet) and sacroiliac joint are thought to be responsible for axial back pain, although with less frequency than the disc. Imaging findings of the structural changes of osteoarthritis do not correlate with pain production. Physiologic imaging, either with single-photon emission CT bone scan, heavily T2-weighted MRI sequences (short-tau inversion recovery), or gadolinium enhancement, can detect inflammation and are more predictive of an axial pain generator.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Evaluation of 15,000 computed tomography (CT) examinations to investigate if iterative reconstruction (IR) reduces sustainably radiation exposure.METHOD AND MATERIALS: Information from 15,000 CT examinations was collected, including all aspects of the exams such as scan parameter, patient information, and reconstruction instructions. The examinations were acquired between January 2010 and December 2012, while after 15 months a first generation IR algorithm was installed. To collect the necessary information from PACS, RIS, MPPS and structured reports a Dose Monitoring System was developed. To harvest all possible information an optical character recognition system was integrated, for example to collect information from the screenshot CT-dose report. The tool transfers all data to a database for further processing such as the calculation of effective dose and organ doses. To evaluate if IR provides a sustainable dose reduction, the effective dose values were statistically analyzed with respect to protocol type, diagnostic indication, and patient population.RESULTS: IR has the potential to reduce radiation dose significantly. Before clinical introduction of IR the average effective dose was 10.1+/-7.8mSv and with IR 8.9+/-7.1mSv (p*=0.01). Especially in CTA, with the possibility to use kV reduction protocols, such as in aortic CTAs (before IR: average14.2+/-7.8mSv; median11.4mSv /with IR:average9.9+/-7.4mSv; median7.4mSv), or pulmonary CTAs (before IR: average9.7+/-6.2mSV; median7.7mSv /with IR: average6.4+/-4.7mSv; median4.8mSv) the dose reduction effect is significant(p*=0.01).

Little is known about the impact of lymphangionesis in neuroblastoma. From a surgical point of view, lymphatic fistula is a potential complication after neuroblastoma surgery. Aim of this study was the evaluation of frequency and impact of lymphatic leakage in a center for neuroblastoma surgery. Design/Methods: Between 2003 and 2014, 210 patients (pts) were resected for neuroblastoma in our department for neuroblastoma. Out of these, 200 patients were eligible for this study. Patient charts were reviewed for INSS stage, surgical radicality, duration of abdominal or thoracic drainage and maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h. Result(s): Out of 200 patients, 73 patients (37%) had a duration of drainage of 7 or more days. Maximum amount of drainage was 4 liters per day; longest duration of intraabdominal drainage was 91 days. In case of chylous fistula, all patients were treated with a conservative approach. Duration of drainage was significantly associated with surgical radicality (p=0.000). Furthermore, the duration of drainage was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h (p=0.000). Lymphatic fistula was significantly associated with INSS stage (p=0.000). Overall Survival (OS) demonstrated a better OS for patients without LL (87% alive) than pts with LL (72% alive). OS was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 hrs (p=0.009), but not with duration of drainage.

One major problem is the delay of further chemotherapy and radiation which however does not seem to have a great impact on the prognosis.",Excluded
877,"Thyroid follicular cell carcinogenesis. Ample information in experimental animals indicates a relationship between inhibition of thyroid-pituitary homeostasis and the developmental thyroid follicular cell neoplasms. This is generally the case when there are long-term reductions in circulating thyroid hormones which have triggered increases in circulating thyroid stimulating hormone. Such hormonal derangements leading to neoplasms have been produced by different regimens, including dietary iodide deficiency, subtotal thyroidectomy, and administration of natural and xenobiotic chemical substances. The carcinogenic process proceeds through a number of stages, including follicular cell hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and benign and sometimes malignant neoplasms. Given the interrelationship between the thyroid and pituitary glands, conditions that result in stimulation of the thyroid can also result in stimulation of the pituitary, with the development of hyperplastic and neoplastic changes. The progression of events leading to thyroid (and pituitary) neoplasms can be reversed under certain circumstances be reestablishing thyroid-pituitary homeostasis. Most chemicals that have induced follicular cell tumors seem to operate through inhibition of the synthesis of thyroid hormone or an increase in their degradation and removal. For some of these compounds, it appears that genotoxic reactions may not be playing a dominant role in the carcinogenic process. A seemingly small group of thyroid carcinogens seems to lack influence on thyroid-pituitary status and may in part be operating via their genotoxic potential. In contrast with the well-established relationship between thyroid-pituitary derangement and follicular cell neoplasms in animals, the state of information in humans is much less certain. At this time, ionizing radiation is the only acknowledged human thyroid carcinogen, a finding well established in experimental systems as well. Although humans respond to goitrogenic stimuli as do animals, with the development of cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and under certain circumstances nodular lesions, disagreement exists as to whether malignant transformation occurs in any predictable manner. It would seem that if humans develop thyroid tumors following long-term derangement in thyroid-pituitary status, they may be less sensitive than the commonly used animal models.

An extended exposure of the retina to visible light may lead to photochemical damage in retinal photoreceptor cells. The exact mechanism of retinal light damage remains unknown, and an effective therapy is still unavailable. Here, we demonstrated that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), markedly protected 661W photoreceptor cells from visible light exposure-induced damage at the nanomolar level. We also observed by transmission electron microscopy that light exposure led to severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in 661W cells as well as abnormal endomembranes and ER membranes. In addition, obvious upregulated ER stress markers were monitored by western blot at the protein level and by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the mRNA level. Interestingly, rapamycin pretreatment significantly suppressed light-induced ER stress and all three major branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including the RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways both at the protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by rapamycin was further confirmed with a dithiothreitol (DTT; a classical ER stress inducer)-damaged 661W cell model. Meanwhile, our results also revealed that rapamycin was able to remarkably inhibit the activation of mTOR and its downstream factors eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), p-4EBP1, p70, p-p70, and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-S6K) in the light-injured 661W cells.

199,"Intracarotid infusion of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum in the treatment of recurrent malignant brain tumors. Thirty-five patients with malignant brain tumors (23 with primary tumors and 12 with brain metastases) progressing after cranial irradiation +/- chemotherapy received cisplatin, 60 to 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup> into the internal carotid artery by a transfemoral approach. Courses of therapy were repeated every 4 weeks. Therapeutic evaluation was performed monthly using the CT scan of the brain and clinical neurologic examination. Thirty patients were evaluable for response. Of 20 evaluable patients with primary malignant brain tumors, 6 responded to therapy and 5 had stable disease. The median time to tumor progression for responding patients was 33 weeks, for stable patients 16 weeks, and 13 weeks for all patients. Five of 10 evaluable patients with brain metastases responded to intracarotid cisplatin, and 2 patients had stable disease. The estimated median time to progression for responding patients was 30+ weeks and 12+ weeks for patients with stable disease. Side-effects included seizures in 5 courses, mental agitation and motor restlessness in 1, and transient hemiparesis in 7. One patient may have had a drug-related death, and one patient appeared to develop encephalopathy after treatment. Five patients had clinical deterioration in vision; in two patients it was bilateral. Intracarotid cisplatin has definite activity in patients with malignant primary brain tumors and in patients with brain metastases.

3158,"Technology insight: Image-guided robotic radiosurgery - A new approach for noninvasive ablation of spinal lesions. The need for an effective noninvasive tool to ablate spinal lesions reflects the limitations of traditional surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches. Open surgery is invasive and carries a risk of neurological injury and vertebral column dysfunction. Conventional radiotherapy often has poor clinical efficacy and a risk of neurologic complications. Spinal radiosurgery has been developed to overcome these limitations. This technique consists of precise delivery of high-dose radiation to a spinal target. To spare the delicate and radiation-sensitive spinal cord and to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications, it is essential that the radiation dose decreases rapidly outside of the target. This is accomplished by use of advanced, image-guidance technology, treatment planning software, and robotics. Preliminary data indicate that this approach can achieve high rates of tumor control of spinal and paraspinal lesions and durable reduction of associated vertebral pain without neurological complications. Although spinal radiosurgery is not yet widely practiced, the benefits of this new therapeutic approach are likely to encourage its widespread adoption in coming years.",Excluded
2211,"Effect of He-Ne laser radiation on the monoamine in mouse brain. Background: It is known that monoamine may take part in the regulation of various functional activities of the body and also in the pathophysiological processes, but the reports about the influnences of low-power laser radiation over monoamine are still rare. Moreover, the results gained are very inconsistent, and some are even contradictory to each other. Objective(s): To elucidate whether low power He-Ne laser radiation can affects serotonin(5-HT) and dopamine(DA) in brain. Design(s): A completely randomlized study based on the experimental. Setting and Materials: The experiment was done in the Central Laboratory of the First Hospital of Beijing University. Materials used were 90 Kunming male mice with body-weight 20-27 g, supplied by Beijing University Animal Centre. Intervention(s): The mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups with randomized arithmetic form. They are normal control group, sham radiation group, aser irradiation group A(13.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), aser irradiation group B (27.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) and laser irradiation group C(55.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The cranial bone and brain of the mouse was exposed under mild anesthesia and irradiated on the sinciput with different doses of He-Ne laser. Then the mice were killed by decapitation. Living creature samples were made. Main Outcome Measure(s): The cerebral serotonin and dopamine were observed and measured by means of high performance liguid chromatography-electrochemistry (HPLC-EC). Result(s): Dopamine contents (ng/g) were 485.4 +/- 10.1 in laser group A, 505.8 +/- 10.3 in laser group B and 524.1 +/- 10.5 in laser group C, with significant difference as compared with that of the sham laser group( 446.5 +/- 7.1) (P < 0.05, F = 4.64; P < 0.01, F = 8.63; P < 0.01, F = 14.52, respectively). Serotonin contents (ng/g) were 1 283.8 +/- 25.1 in laser group A, 1 337.0 +/- 26.8 in laser group B and 1429.9 +/- 30.1 in laser group C, significantly higher than that of the sham laser group(1 198.0 +/- 28.5) (P < 0.05, F = 4.92; P < 0.01, F = 9.75; P < 0.01, F = 16.83, respectively). It was found that there was a significant increase in the cerebral serotonin and dopamine in the irradiated mice, and within the laser dose range used, the larger is the laser dose was, the more DA and 5-HT are. Conclusion(s): He-Ne laser radiation may cause a significant increase in 5-HT and DA in the brain of the mice, and the increase is related to the dose of laser radiation.",Excluded
2862,"Neuroradiographic changes following convection-enhanced delivery of the recombinant cytotoxin interleukin 13-PE38QQR for recurrent malignant glioma. OBJECT: Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a novel method for delivering therapeutic agents to infiltrative brain tumor cells. For agents administered by CED, changes on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging directly resulting from catheter placement, infusion, and the therapeutic compound may confound any interpretation of tumor progression. As part of an ongoing multiinstitutional Phase I study, 14 patients with recurrent malignant glioma underwent CED of interleukin (IL) 13-PE38QQR, a recombinant cytotoxin consisting of human IL-13 conjugated with a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. Serial neuroradiographic changes were assessed in this cohort of patients. METHOD(S): Patients were treated in two groups: Group 1 patients received IL13-PE38QQR before and after tumor resection; Group 2 patients received infusion only after tumor resection. Preoperative and postinfusion MR images were obtained prospectively at specified regular intervals. Changes were noted along catheter tracks on postresection MR images obtained in all patients. A simple grading system was developed to describe these changes. When MR imaging changes appeared to be related to IL1 3-PE38QQR, patients were followed up without instituting new antitumor therapy. CONCLUSION(S): As CED of therapeutic agents becomes more common, clinicians and investigators must become aware of associated neuroimaging changes that should be incorporated into toxicity assessment. We have developed a simple grading system to facilitate communication about these changes among investigators. Biological imaging modalities that could possibly distinguish these changes from recurrent tumor should be evaluated. In this study the authors demonstrate the challenges in determining efficacy when surrogate end points such as time to tumor progression as defined by new or progressive contrast enhancement on MR imaging are used with this treatment modality.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The recommended treatment for O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM) is radiation therapy with concurrent/adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). However, it is well known that the clinical benefit from TMZ is lower in these patients. We sought to analyze patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone in this cohort using a large, hospital database.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM from 2010 to 2012 who received radiation (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of receiving chemoradiation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS) by treatment group and Cox regression analysis was used to assess impact of covariates on OS.RESULTS: There were 738 patients who met the study criteria, of which 107 (14.5%) received RT alone and 631 (85.5%) received CRT with median RT dose 6000cGy for both groups. Median follow up for living patients was 21.9 months. Ninety-two (12.5%) patients did not undergo any resection, 330 (44.7%) underwent a subtotal resection and 316 (42.8%) had a gross total resection. The median and 2-year OS was 16.8 months and 24.7% for RT alone compared to 15.6 months and 25.9% for the CRT group (p=0.250). On multivariable analysis, the addition of chemotherapy had no impact on survival (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86-1.46, p=0.396).CONCLUSION: Despite the routine use of chemoradiation among patients with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM, there does not appear to be a survival benefit compared to radiation alone.",Excluded

Apart from being a neuropathy developed by the compression and irritation of piriformis muscle on the sciatic nerve, piriformis syndrome (PS) can also be caused by a trigger point without sciatic nerve involvement. Although it has been reported that PS could be seen in individuals at all activity levels, PS in patients who had spinal cord injury (SCI) has not been reported. In this study, a case of paraplegia, suffering from hip pain, who had been diagnosed and treated as PS was presented. A 62 years old woman complaining about pain and numbness in low back and right hip was admitted to our clinic. She was mobilized by crutches. From her anamnesis it was understood that she developed paraplegia after a fall two years ago. In her physical examination, she was diagnosed as ASIA: D T3 incomplete paraplegia. Her complaints had started 6 months ago after falling on her right hip. She had a severe pain with radicular radiation, during the deep palpation of the piriformis muscle. Compression of lumbar spinous processes were slightly painful. While FAIR, Pace, Beatty tests were positive on the right side, straight leg raising and the Laseque tests were both negative. For the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, 4 cc of 2% lidocaine+1 cc of betametazon dipropionate injection with a 22 G 88 mm Spinocan was done under the guidance of ultrasound into the piriformis muscle. The patient was diagnosed as PS as there was a significant relief of symptoms after the injection. When the risk factors that can cause PS were questioned, we learned that she had a habit of eating on the floor and sitting with her legs crossed. The patient's activities of daily living were organized and medical treatment, lumbosacral orthosis and piriformis stretching exercises were given. It was observed that her complaints diminished gradually in 1st. and 3rd. months controls. In conclusion, while neuropathic pain below the level of neurologic injury often suggest central pain in patients with SCI, PS is a must to be considered in the differential diagnosis of hip pain especially in patients with incomplete SCI.",Excluded
202,"EUS-guided celiac ganglion irradiation with iodine-125 seeds for pain control in pancreatic carcinoma: a prospective pilot study. BACKGROUND: Celiac plexus neurolysis for the palliative reduction of pain in unresectable pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is safe but provides limited relief. In a previous study, we found that EUS-guided implantation of iodine-125 ((125)I) around the celiac ganglia is a safe procedure and can induce apoptosis of local neurons in a porcine model.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds for the relief of moderate to severe pain secondary to unresectable PC.DESIGN: Prospective study.SETTING: Single, tertiary care referral center.PATIENTS: This study enrolled consecutive patients who had moderate to severe pain resulting from biopsy-proven unresectable PC.INTERVENTION: All patients underwent EUS-guided direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds. Follow-up was conducted at least once weekly until death.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Blood parameters, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, mean analgesic (MS Contin [morphine sulfate]) consumption, and complications were evaluated during follow-up.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with unresectable PC underwent the procedure. The mean number of seeds implanted in the celiac ganglion per patient was 4 (range 2-6).

PURPOSE: To assess the safety, efficacy, and quality of life (QOL) associated with radiosurgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1996 and June 2001, 112 patients with TN refractory to medical or surgical management were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at the University of Maryland Medical Center. A median prescription dose of 75 Gy (range: 70-80 Gy) was delivered to the involved trigeminal nerve root entry zone. Treatment outcomes were assessed through patient self-reports of pain control and medication usage during follow-up visits. In addition, patients responded to a standard questionnaire containing the Barrow Neurologic Institute Pain Scale (BNI) and selected sections of the McGill Pain Scale. Treatment outcomes and objective quality of life measures were also addressed.RESULTS: Ninety-six patients (86%) completed questionnaires for a median follow-up of 30 months (range: 8-66 months). Seventy-four patients (77%) reported pain relief occurring after a median of 3 weeks (range: 0-24 weeks) after GKRS. A decrease in medication usage was noted in 66% of patients. Actuarial analysis demonstrated 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year recurrence rates of 23%, 33%, and 39%, respectively. Response to treatment was associated with lack of prior surgical treatment (p = 0.03) and less than 50 months' pain duration before GKRS (p = 0.04). Patients who described their TN pain as more severe than their worst non-TN headache pain (McGill Pain Scale IV-V vs. I-III) were also more likely to respond to treatment (p < 0.001). Seven (7.3%) patients reported new or increased trigeminal dysfunction; however, only 3.1% reported these symptoms as bothersome (BNI III-IV). Patients with sustained pain relief reported an average of 100% improvement in their QOL as a direct result of pain relief after GKRS, and 100% believed that the procedure was successful. Furthermore, among those patients with temporary pain relief and subsequent recurrence, 65% felt their treatment was a success with an average of 80% improvement in their QOL.CONCLUSIONS: GKRS provides significant pain relief and improves QOL in the majority of patients treated for TN, with few bothersome side effects. Patients with both temporary and sustained responses to treatment realized significant improvements in QOL after GKRS, and considered their treatment successful. Longer follow-up of these patients may reveal additional recurrences highlighting the importance of studies evaluating repeat GKRS and optimization of current treatment techniques and patient selection.",Excluded
2252,"Shifting and scaling adaptation to dynamic stimuli in somatosensory cortex. Recent reports have shown that responses of midbrain neurons in the guinea pig rapidly shift the dynamic range of their responses to track changes in the statistics of ongoing sound-level distributions. This results in an increased coding accuracy for the most commonly occurring stimulus intensities. To investigate whether this type of adaptation might also be found in other sensory modalities, we characterized the intensity-response functions of neurons in rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to continuous sinusoidal vibration of the whiskers with amplitudes that were changed every 40 ms. Vibration amplitudes were selected randomly such that there was an 80% chance for the amplitude to be drawn from a relatively narrow 'high-probability region' (HPR). Stimulus mean and variance were then manipulated by shifting or widening the HPR. We found that rat S1 neurons adapt to shifts of the HPR mainly by shifting their thresholds, and to changes in HPR width by changing the slope of their rate-level curves. Using realistic single-neuron models, we go on to show that after-hyperpolarizing currents, such as those carried by K(Ca)(2+) channels, may be responsible for the threshold shifts, but not the slope changes.",Excluded

1429,"FM1-43 is a permeant blocker of mechanosensitive ion channels in sensory neurons and inhibits behavioural responses to mechanical stimuli. The molecular identity and pharmacological properties of mechanically gated ion channels in sensory neurons are poorly understood. We show that FM1-43, a styryl dye used to fluorescently label cell membranes, permeates mechanosensitive ion channels in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, resulting in blockade of three previously defined subtypes of mechanically activated currents. Blockade and dye uptake is voltage dependent and regulated by external Ca2+. The structurally related larger dye FM3-25 inhibited mechanically activated currents to a lesser degree and did not permeate the channels. In vivo, FMI-43 decreases pain sensitivity in the Randall-Selitto test and increases the withdrawal threshold from von Frey hairs, together suggesting that the channels expressed at the cell body in culture mediate mechanosensation in the intact animal. These data give further insight into the mechanosensitive ion channels expressed by somatosensory neurons and suggest FM dyes are an interesting tool for studying them.",Excluded

Moreover, a lower dose of radiation is delivered to normal tissue with mMLC-based radiosurgery than with arc-based radiosurgery, which theoretically should lead to a reduced risk of complications.",Excluded
1068,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro. Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 muM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K<sup>+</sup> conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow afterhyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC<inf>50</inf> of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF<inf>9-41</inf> (5 muM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow afterhyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow afterhyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded
2621,"Copper-induced conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase. The Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase plays a critical role in the intracellular trafficking of copper. Mutations in this protein lead to the accumulation of a toxic level of copper in the liver, kidney, and brain followed by extensive tissue damage and death. The ATPase has a novel amino-terminal domain ( approximately 70 kDa) which contains six repeats of the copper binding motif GMTCXXC. We have expressed and characterized this domain with respect to the copper binding sites and the conformational consequences of copper binding. A detailed analysis of this domain by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has revealed that each binding site ligates copper in the +1 oxidation state using two cysteine side chains with distorted linear geometry. Analysis of copper-induced conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain indicates that both secondary and tertiary structure changes take place upon copper binding. These copper-induced conformational changes could play an important role in the function and regulation of the ATPase in vivo. In addition to providing important insights on copper binding to the protein, these results suggest a possible mechanism of copper trafficking by the Wilson disease ATPase.",Excluded
2366,"Hepatic iron loading and oxidative stress in ataxia-telangiectasia mice. Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in a myriad of abnormalities including progressive neurodegeneration, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to ionising radiation. At a cellular level A-T is a disease of chronic oxidative stress (OS) resulting from reduced antioxidant defence capacity leading to the oxidative damage of proteins, lipids, and DNA. Transition metals such as Fe<sup>2/+</sup> act as pro-oxidative molecules, catalysing the conversion of weakly reactive oxygen species such as H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, causing significant oxidative damage. Cellular iron accumulation and the resultant OS has also been linked to the neurodegeneration seen in Alzheimer0s and Parkinson's diseases, lymphoid tumours (which occur in approximately 30% of A-T patients), and ionising radiation hypersensitivity. To investigate iron regulation in A-T, iron indices, iron regulatory gene expression, and markers of oxidative stress were studied in livers of wild-type and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) null mice on a control diet and when challenged with a high iron diet. At 10 weeks of age, Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a control diet had increased serum iron, hepatic iron and ferritin, with significantly up-regulated hepcidin (Hamp1) expression compared to wild-type mice. When challenged with the high iron diet Bone morphogenetic protein 6, Hfe, and Ferroportin were all significantly up-regulated in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> compared to wild-type mice. Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice also had significantly higher hepatic OS that increased disproportionately in animals fed the high iron diet. In summary, we have demonstrated that Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a propensity to accumulate iron in spite of the appropriate regulation of genes involved in iron homeostasis. The increased hepatic iron in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice is associated with a disproportionately large increase in hepatic OS. Our results suggest that increased iron status may contribute to the chronic OS seen in A-T patients.",Excluded
2542,"Influence of rotational setup errors on dose in target and organs at risk in cranial radiotherapy. Purpose or Objective: The aim of this study is to detect dose aberrations in cranial radiation therapy in the target volume and adjacent organs at risk (OARs) caused by insufficient rotational setup correction. 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) fusions were considered as the gold standard and compared to 4 DOF and 3 DOF registrations. Material(s) and Method(s): Setup errors of 12 patients with cranial lesions undergoing radiotherapy and positioned with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were analyzed. The PTVs of the included patients were large and irregularly shaped and located near or overlapping cranial OARs such as brainstem, chiasm, optical nerves or lenses. A registration between planning CT and the first CBCT of the treatment course was performed using 6 DOF, 4 DOF and 3 DOF. Differences between the three registrations were implemented and the planning CT and associated structure set shifted and warped accordingly. To detect the DOF with the largest influence on the delivered dose a rotational error of 2degree, 3degree and 4degree was simulated in one rotational dimension at a time. Using the original parameters, the treatment plan was copied and recalculated to the warped image set. Dmax and Dmean of the cranial OARs and D98 and D2 for the respective CTV and PTV were analyzed. Result(s): Differences between 6 DOF and 4 or 3 DOF fusion ranged between -1.4degree and 2degree in pitch direction, -2.5degree to 2degree in yaw, and -4.4degree to 4.2degree in roll direction. Resulting median D98 in the PTV decreased by 0.7 Gy using only 3 DOF and increased by 0.08 Gy if 4 DOF were included. Maximum dose reduction of the PTV D98 was 2.96 Gy using 3 DOF and 0.39 Gy using 4 DOF. CTV dose decreased by 0.68 using only 3 DOF and by 0.03 Gy using 4 DOF. Resulting median dose effects in the OARs are displayed in Figure 1, with largest effects of additional 0.2 and 0.8 Gy for the left and right lenses, respectively. Doses for individual patients varied up to additional 6 Gy in the lenses and 3 Gy in the optic nerves. Effects on doses in the OARs and target volumes were generally larger with 3 DOF than with 4 DOF included, except for the brainstem with no visible difference. Pitch and roll setup errors had larger effects on the OARs compared to yaw setup deviations, as demonstrated in Figure 2. 2degree roll setup errors caused more than 5 Gy dose effect on the ipsilateral optical nerve and chiasm, followed by 2degree pitch errors resulting in over 3 Gy additional dose. The simulated 2degree yaw error had an effect of under 1 Gy on dose delivery. [Figure Presented] [Figure Presented] Conclusion(s): For cases involving higher dose effects on the evaluated structures, 4DOF registration improved plan conformity compared to 3DOF. Clinically relevant dose deviations in the CTV were not found in this patient collective. While mean dose delivery to OARs increased only slightly, up to 6 Gy in additional dose occurred for individual patient cases in this collective because of rotational errors. Safety margins for OARs could be a solution to this matter. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded
1888,"Evaluation of absorbed dose in respiratory-gated radiotherapy using a phantom system that simulates patient respiration. [Japanese]. Respiratory-gated (RG) radiotherapy is useful for minimizing the irradiated volume of normal tissues resulting from the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. In this technique, although improvement in the dose distribution of the target can be expected, the actual absorbed dose distribution is not clearly determined. Therefore, it is important to clarify the absorbed dose at the tumor and at the evaluation points according to the patient's respiration. We have developed a phantom system that simulates patient respiration (TNK Co., Ltd.), to evaluate the absorbed dose and ensure precise RG radiotherapy. Actual patient respiratory signals were obtained using a respiratory synchronization and gating system (AZ-733V, Anzai Medical). The acquired data were then transferred to a phantom system driven by a ball screw to simulate the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. We measured the absorbed dose using a micro-ionization chamber dosimeter and the dose distribution using the film method for RG irradiation at expiratory phase by using Linac (PRIMUS, Toshiba Medical Systems Corp.) X-rays. When the distance of phantom movement was set to the average patient respiratory movement distance of 1.5 cm, we first compared absorbed dose with RG irradiation with a gating signal of 50% or less, and without RG irradiation. The absorbed dose at the iso-center was improved by 6.0% and 4.4% at a field size of 4x4 cm2, and by 1.3% and 0.7% at a field size of 5x5 cm2 with an X-ray energy of 6 MV and 10 MV, respectively. There was, however, no dose change at a field size of 10x10 cm2 and 15x15 cm2. When the gating signal was reduced to 25% and 10%, absorbed dose was also improved. With regard to the flatness of the dose profile, no changes in dose distribution were observed in the lateral direction, e.g., beam flatness was within 1.4% and 1.6% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively, with an X-ray energy of 6 MV. In the cranial-caudal direction, the dose profile was relatively large even if a gating signal of 50% was applied, i.e., 8.1% and 10.4% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. Beam flatness without RG was much worse, i.e., 37.8% and 38.2%, at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. In both cases, the dose was insufficient in the expiratory direction. Although RG radiotherapy is quite useful, the margins in the inspiratory and expiratory phases should be considered based on the level of gating signal and field size in order to formulate appropriate radiotherapy planning in terms of the shifting of internal structures.

977,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters. BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded
422,"Supratentorial malignant glioma: Patterns of recurrence and implications for external beam local treatment. Pre- and postoperative computerized tomography scans, simulator films, and computerized tomography scans documenting tumor recurrence were analyzed on 70 patients with supratentorial malignant glioma treated with whole brain plus boost radiation therapy to determine sites of recurrence in relation to the boost. The boost was planned using the postoperative computerized tomography scan. Tumor recurred in 53 patients - within the boost in 38 (72%), partly outside the boost in 12 (23%), outside the boost but within the brain in one (2%), in the boost and in the spinal cord in one (2%), and in the spinal cord only in one (2%). All recurrences confined to the brain were found within 4 cm of the enhancing tumor as defined by the preoperative computerized tomography scan. Recurrences outside the boost were more common with inadequate boost margins, small boost volumes, temporal lobe tumors, and homolateral wedge pair technique. Survival was not adversely affected by recurrence outside the boost. We recommend that patients with malignant glioma be treated by parallel opposed fields with a margin that is 4 cm beyond the edge of the preoperative enhancing tumor, as seen on computerized tomography scan.",Excluded
3380,"Radiobiological analysis of tissue responses following radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery provided clinicians the ability to administer high single-doses of radiation to intracranial targets with relative safety. Analysis of clinical outcome from radiosurgery calls into question some of the radiobiological principles that have guided conventional fractionated radiotherapy in the past. The response of the tumor or target tissue being irradiated, as well as the response of the surrounding normal tissue, seems predominantly determined by the tumor or target vasculature. Injury to the tumor or target vasculature appears to contribute to the probability of developing normal tissue complications. Estimations of alpha/beta values from radiosurgical dose-response data consistently yield values that conflict with values from fractionated radiotherapy and with linear-quadratic theory. This indicates that projections from high-dose single-fractions to fractionated dose-equivalents made using the linear-quadratic formula are unreliable. Radiobiological analysis of clinical data from radiosurgery provides models for guiding treatment to achieve desired effects and provide reliable estimates of complications.",Excluded

1826,"Current concepts in the management of erectile dysfunction in men with prostate cancer. Development in the management of prostate cancer has placed increased attention on patient quality of life after treatment, particularly sexual function. The incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men following radical prostatectomy has been estimated to range from 16% to 82%. Several factors determine the postoperative incidence of erectile difficulties; these include patient age, degree of cavernosal nerve sparing during surgery, cancer stage, and associated comorbidities. Early initiation of available treatments after radical prostatectomy, such as phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and intracavernosal alprostadil, may improve the speed and degree of recovery of erectile function. Oral PDE-5 inhibitors are recognized as the first line of therapy for men with ED after radical prostatectomy, with reasonable success rates reported for all commercially available PDE-5 inhibitors. In recognition of the neurogenic basis for erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy, new strategies have been devised, such as cavernous nerve graft interposition procedures, perioperative neuroprotection measures, and postoperative neurotrophic treatments. Hopefully, these efforts will improve quality of life for patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this article is to review the current modalities of ED management for men with prostate cancer.

Learning Objectives: Cancer survival rates continue to improve due to improvement in surgical techniques and combined therapies but multiple studies have shown poor outcome in cancer patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU). Our study specifically looked at the outcome in lung cancer patients. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated patients with lung cancer on active chemotherapy in past 6 months who were admitted to the ICU from 2011-2016. Out of 250, 80 patients met the inclusion criteria. Result(s): The mean patient age was 69 with 48% males. Majority cancer type was non-small cell lung cancer(55%)and squamous cell cancer(29%). 60% patients were stage 4 and 40% patients were combined stages 1-3. 50% had local lung metastasis followed by 19%, 18% and 11% brain, bone and liver metastasis, respectively. Besides chemotherapy,24% had prior surgery and 45% had radiation for treatment.18% were admitted due to cancer progression (CP), 64% due to reversible cancer complications (RCC), and 19 % due to therapy complications (TC). Most common admitting diagnoses were: hypoxic respiratory failure (32, 40%) and sepsis (19,24%). The median ICU length of stay was 4 days. In ICU, 35 patients (44%) had ventilator dependent respiratory failure (VDRF), 42 (52%) had sepsis, 46 (57%) had renal failure (RF), 11 (14%) had liver failure(LF), 10 (12%) had pancytopenia. 18 patients (22%) were DNR at ICU admission and 62 (78%) were full code. Only 6 patients (7.5%) had palliative goals of care before ICU admission. In-hospital mortality (IHM) was 19 patients (24%) overall, and highest in those with cardiac failure(50%, p = .008),VDRF(43%,p = 0.002),followed by sepsis (40.4%,p = 0.004), and pancytopenia 40%,p = 0.16). IHM was 21% in pts with CP, 25% in patients with a RCC and 20% in pts with a TC. After discharge, 35 patients (58.3%) went back on Rx and 23 (38.3%) chose hospice. After discharge, 18% were dead at 30 days, 28% at 90-days. Only 49% had more than one year survival.

2934,"Extracellular currents alter gap junction intercellular communication in synovial fibroblasts. We studied the effect of extremely low frequency (ELF) currents on gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) mediated by connexin43 protein. Confluent monolayers of synovial fibroblasts (HIG-82) and neuroblastoma cells (5Y) were exposed in bath solution to 0-75 mA/m(2) (0-56 mV/m), 60 Hz. Single channel conductance, cell membrane current-voltage (I-V) curves, and Ca(2+) influx were measured using the nystatin single and double patch methods. The conductances of the closed and open states of the gap junction channel in HIG-82 cells were each significantly reduced (by 0.76 and 0.39 pA, respectively) in cells exposed to 20 mA/m(2). Current densities as low as 10 mA/m(2) significantly increased Ca(2+) influx in HIG-82 cells. No effects were seen in 5Y cells. The I-V curves of the plasma membranes of both types of cells were independent of 60 Hz electric fields and current densities, 0-75 mA/m(2), indicating that the effect of the 60 Hz fields on GJIC in HIG-82 cells was not mediated by a change in membrane potential. We conclude that ELF electric fields can alter GJIC in synovial cells via a mechanism that does not depend on changes in membrane potential, but may depend on Ca(2+) influx. The results open the possibility that GJIC mediated responses in synovial cells, such as for example, their secretory responses to proinflammatory cytokines, could be antagonized by the application of ELF electric fields.",Excluded
705,"Repeated head CT in the neurosurgical intensive care unit: feasibility of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit undergo multiple head CT scans, resulting in high cumulative radiation exposures. Our aim was to assess the acceptability of a dedicated, special-purpose sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT protocol for neurosurgical intensive care unit surveillance head CT examinations, comparing image quality with studies performed with our standard-of-care sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT and legacy filtered back-projection standard-dose CT protocols.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 54 head CT examinations: ultra-low-dose CT (n = 22), low-dose CT (n = 12), and standard-dose CT (n = 20) in 22 patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Standard-dose CT was reconstructed by using filtered back-projection on a Somatom Sensation 64 scanner. Ultra-low-dose CT and ultra-low-dose CT examinations were performed on a Siemens AS+128 scanner with commercially available sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative parameters, including image quality and dose, were evaluated.RESULTS: Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ultra-low-dose CT represented a 68% lower dose index volume compared with filtered back-projection standard-dose CT techniques in the same patients while maintaining similar quality and SNR levels. Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT offered higher image quality than filtered back-projection standard-dose CT (P < .05) with no differences in SNR at a 24% lower dose index volume. Compared with low-dose CT, ultra-low-dose CT had significantly lower SNR (P = .001) but demonstrated clinically satisfactory measures of image quality.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit, dedicated ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance head CT imaging led to a significant dose reduction while maintaining adequate image quality.",Excluded
1470,"Equivalent outcomes with hypofractionated, accelerated thoracic radiation therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Does this represent a reasonable strategy in patients unable to attend twice daily treatment?. Purpose/Objective(s): The publication of RTOG 8815 established hyperfractionated, twice-daily thoracic radiation therapy (BID RT) with concurrent platinum-etoposide (PE) as the standard of care in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, many patients with this aggressive, often debilitating malignancy find BID RT intolerable due to both physical and logistical limitations. As an alternative, patients unable to receive BID RT are treated with daily 3Gy fractions (QD RT) to a total dose of 45Gy at our institution.We hypothesized that hypofractionated QD RT in the setting of concurrent PE would be as safe and effective as BID RT. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with LS-SCLC treated with curative intent. Patients received 45Gy either QD (3Gy) or BID (1.5Gy) with concurrent PE. Covariables reviewed include age, gender, race, insurance status, year of diagnosis, 3D vs IMRT planning, PTV volume, chemotherapy agents and cycles, RT dose and fractionation, incidence of Grade >=2 radiation pneumonitis and subsequent delivery of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare the characteristics of treatment groups for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were generated, with accompanying univariate (UVA) log-rank and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-six patients were evaluable, with a median follow-up of 13 months for the entire cohort (range 3-79), and a median follow-up of 18.5 months for survivors (range 7-73). 88% of patients were deceased at last follow-up. For the entire cohort, median age was 63 years (range 54-81). 24 (67%) patients received BID RT; 12 (33%) received QD RT. BID and QD groups were balanced with respect to age, race, sex, insurance status, PTV volume, and 3D vs IMRT planning. One patient in each group was treated with corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. No significant differences were observed for PFS or OS outcomes. 2-year PFS was 13.4% (BID) vs 16.7% (QD) (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-1.67; p<.61) and 2-year OS was 34.5% (BID) vs 31.7% (QD) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.28-1.86; p<.51). Neither the incidence of Grade >= 2 radiation pneumonitis (p=0.61) nor utilization of PCI (BID 58% vs 50% QD, p=0.64) differed between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In this single-institution study, hypofractionated QD RT to 45Gy delivered with concurrent PE was associated with toxicity and outcomes comparable to BID RT with concurrent PE. Further validation with a larger, prospective dataset is warranted. Daily hypofractionated thoracic RT with concurrent chemotherapy represents a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot be treated twice daily.",Excluded

Clinical article. OBJECT: High-flow fistulas associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a significant challenge to both stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of multimodality treatment of AVMs in association with a large arteriovenous fistula (AVF), with a special focus on endovascular embolization and its associated complications.METHODS: One hundred ninety-two patients harboring cerebral AVMs underwent endovascular treatment in the authors' department between 1997 and 2003. Of these, the authors selected 74 patients presenting with an AVM associated with high-flow AVF(s) for a retrospective analysis based on the findings of superselective angiography. After endovascular embolization, 32 patients underwent resection, 33 underwent either SRS or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT), and 3 underwent both surgery and SRS. Six patients underwent embolization only. Immediate and midterm treatment outcomes were analyzed.RESULTS: Fifty-seven (77%) of the 74 patients had AVMs that were Spetzler-Martin Grade III or higher. A complete resection was achieved in all 32 patients. Of patients who underwent SRS/HSRT, 13 patients (39.3%) had either complete or > 90% obliteration of the AVM, and 2 patients (6.1%) had incomplete obliteration. Fourteen patients (42.4%) with residual AVM underwent repeated radiotherapy (and remain under observation). Of the 3 patients who underwent both SRS and resection, resection was complete in 2 and incomplete in one. No follow-up was obtained in 6 patients (8.1%). An endovascular complication was observed in 4 patients (5.4%). Fistula embolization was safely performed in every patient, whereas every endovascular complication was associated with other procedures such as nidus embolization.CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular occlusion of the fistulous component was successfully achieved in every patient; every endovascular complication in this series was related to other procedures such as nidus embolization. The importance of the fistula treatment should be emphasized to minimize the endovascular complications and to maximize the treatment effect when a multimodality therapy is used to treat brain AVMs with large AVF.",Excluded

Hearing loss is the main limitation of radiation therapy for vestibular schwannoma (VS), and identifying treatment options that minimize hearing loss are urgently needed. Treatment with bevacizumab is associated with tumor control and hearing improvement in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients; however, its effect is not durable and its mechanism of action on nerve function is unknown. We modeled the effect anti-VEGF therapy on neurological function in the sciatic nerve model and found that it improves neurological function by alleviating tumor edema, which may further improve results by decreasing muscle atrophy and increasing nerve regeneration. Using a cranial window model, we showed that anti-VEGF treatment may achieve these effects via normalizing the tumor vasculature, improving vessel perfusion, and delivery of oxygenation. It is known that oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer; therefore, we further demonstrated that combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy can achieve a better tumor control and help lower the radiation dose and, thus, minimize radiation-related neurological toxicity.

High-frequency electrical stimulation through electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reduce significantly the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the success of this treatment, the mechanisms of action of stimulation are poorly understood. To elucidate further the mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation and its effects on cortical activity, we recorded electroencephalographic potentials from 61 scalp-surface electrodes during low-frequency (5-10 Hz) bipolar stimulation in 11 patients with advanced PD (14 implanted electrodes were tested). In all electrodes tested, stimulation through at least one of the four contacts produced a medium-latency waveform with an average onset of 14 +/- 3 ms and peak at 23 +/- 4 ms. This potential typically increased in magnitude across contacts from ventral to dorsal. Within-subject comparisons of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated that the generator of the medium-latency potential was within the primary sensorimotor cortex or lateral premotor cortex ipsilateral to stimulation. The timing and topography of this potential were consistent with indirect activation of the cortex by excitation of pallido-thalamic axons that traverse the dorsal aspect of the STN. The potential evoked by stimulation through the contact used for optimal clinical effect was highly variable across electrodes and frequently different from the medium-latency potential described above, suggesting that the neuronal elements mediating the medium-latency potential were different from those that mediate the clinical effects.",Excluded

Quantitative analysis was carried out using static SPET images obtained 23 h after injection. We calculated V<inf>3</inf>'' [(striatal - occipital)/occipital ratio] values from images without correction, with AC, and with SC and AC. Two types of regions of interest (ROI) were placed on the striatum: a small square ROI and a larger ROI containing most of the striatum. After validating the correction method in a phantom experiment, a human study was carried out involving eight normal volunteers and 15 patients. The larger ROI yielded smaller V<inf>3</inf>'' values. The effect of attenuation correction was modest, whereas that of scatter correction was marked.

However, risk factors that render certain individuals more vulnerable to depression following an inflammatory stimulus have not been determined. Drawing from animal stud-ies showing that reductions in neural plasticity may mediate effects of inflammation on depressive symptoms, we hypothesized that individuals genetically predisposed to lower levels of neural plasticity may be more susceptible to inflammation-induced depression. More specifically, the current study examined whether the Met allele of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which predisposes individuals to reduced levels of plasticity, moderates the association between inflammation and depressive symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 111 women with early-stage breast cancer who had recently completed treatment with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, which can activate inflammatory pathways. Participants provided blood draws for genotyping and assessment of circulating inflammatory markers, and completed a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms, including somatic, affective, and cognitive components of depression. Results revealed a significant interaction between BDNF genotype and CRP in predicting depressive symptoms (p =.036), such that women carrying at least one Met allele displayed a stronger association between CRP and cognitive depressive symptoms than those without a Met allele.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignancy of the brain, is a grade IV astrocytoma. It is one of the most rapidly growing and invasive types of glial tumors. The standard therapy includes surgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy with a median survival of about 14 months. In addition, systemic therapies are limited by the blood-brain barrier. To bypass the barrier, we are developing a gene delivery strategy to inhibit the expression of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR), which are commonly upregulated in GBM. One TKR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is overexpressed in GBM leading to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Our approach is to recruit the RNA interference pathway. Although small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are often utilized to silence gene expression, exogenously expressed siRNAs are not an effective strategy to treat human disease due to both extracellular and intracellular nucleases as well as activation of cellular immunity against foreign nucleic acids. To bypass these degradatory mechanisms, we use a natural miRNA cluster genetic background to effectively deliver the DNA encoding multiple anti-EGFR siRNAs by inserting them into the tertiary structure of the miRNA cluster, miR-17-92. The anti-EGFR polycistronic miRNA cluster (pAAV-miR-IP1) expresses six siRNAs directed against EGFR, specifically targeting the extracellular ligand binding domain, transmembrane domain, intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and 3' untranslated region of the EGFR transcript. The vector, pAAV-miR-IP1, was transfected into the human GBM cell lines, A172 and U87MG.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) co-ordinates circadian behaviour and physiology in mammals.

The cell-autonomous and circuit-level mechanisms whereby VIP synchronises the SCN are poorly understood. We show that SCN slices in organotypic culture demonstrate rapid and sustained circuit-level circadian responses to VIP that are mediated at a cell-autonomous level. This is accompanied by changes across a broad transcriptional network and by significant VIP-directed plasticity in the internal phasing of the cell-autonomous TTFL. Signalling via ERK1/2 and tuning by its negative regulator DUSP4 are critical elements of the VIP-directed circadian re-programming.

2449,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B. INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors.",Excluded

The transrectal approach to draining deep-seated pelvic collections may be used to drain The transrectal approach to draining deep-seated pelvic collections may be used to drain intra-abdominal collections not reached by the transabdominal approach. We discuss 6 patients with such pelvic collections treated with transrectal drainage using catheter placement via Seldinger technique. Transrectal drainage helped achieve clinical and radiological resolution of pelvic collections in 6 and 5 of 6 cases, respectively. It simultaneously helped avoid injury to intervening bowel loops and neurovascular structures using real-time visualization of armamentarium used for drainage.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of volume adapted re-planning for radiotherapy (RT) after gross total resection (GTR) for glioblastoma. Nineteen patients with glioblastoma who underwent GTR and postoperative RT were analyzed. The volumes of the surgical cavity on computed tomography (CT) obtained one day after GTR (CT0), the first RT simulation CT (sim-CT1), and the second simulation CT for the boost RT plan (sim-CT2) were compared. The boost RT plan was based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT2 (boost RTP2) and was compared with that based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT1 (boost RTP1). The volume reduction ratios were 14.4%-51.3% (median, 29.0%) between CT0 and sim-CT1 and -7.9%-71.9% (median, 34.9%) between sim-CT1 and sim-CT2 (P < 0.001). The normal brain volumes in boost RTP1 were significantly reduced in boost RTP2, especially at high dose levels. Target volume in sim-CT2 which was not covered with the boost RTP1, developed in five cases (26.3%). The surgical cavity volume was reduced following surgery in patients with glioblastoma who underwent GTR. The application of volume-adapted re-planning during RT could decrease the irradiated volume of normal brain and prevent a target miss for boost RT. © 2013 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Excluded

1113,"Sonic Hedgehog signaling impairs ionizing radiation-induced checkpoint activation and induces genomic instability. The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway plays important roles in embryogenesis, stem cell maintenance, tissue repair, and tumorigenesis. Haploinsufficiency of Patched-1, a gene that encodes a repressor of the Shh pathway, dysregulates the Shh pathway and increases genomic instability and the development of spontaneous and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced tumors by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that Ptc1(+/-) mice have a defect in the IR-induced activation of the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling pathway. Likewise, transient expression of Gli1, a downstream target of Shh signaling, disrupts Chk1 activation in human cells by preventing the interaction of Chk1 with Claspin, a Chk1 adaptor protein that is required for Chk1 activation. These results suggest that inappropriate Shh pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis by disabling a key signaling pathway that helps maintain genomic stability and inhibits tumorigenesis.",Excluded

Background Queensland, Australia, has the highest rates of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Perineural invasion (PNI) is associated with reduced local control and survival. Methods A retrospective review of a prospective database of patients with clinical PNI from cutaneous SCC of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) between 2000 and 2011 and a minimum of 24 months follow-up. Patients were excluded if immunosuppressed, had non-SCC histology, or were treated palliatively. Results Fifty patients (mean age, 60 years) with median follow-up of 50 months were included in this study. A total of 54.8% of known primary tumors had incidental PNI. Ten percent had nodal disease at presentation. MRI neurogram was positive in 95.8%. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 5-years was 62%. Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% and 64%, respectively. There were no perioperative deaths.

1480,"Optogenetic disruption of sleep continuity impairs memory consolidation. Memory consolidation has been proposed as a function of sleep. However, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by several features including duration, intensity, and continuity. Sleep continuity is disrupted in different neurological and psychiatric conditions, many of which are accompanied by memory deficits. This finding has raised the question of whether the continuity of sleep is important for memory consolidation. However, current techniques used in sleep research cannot manipulate a single sleep feature while maintaining the others constant. Here, we introduce the use of optogenetics to investigate the role of sleep continuity in memory consolidation. We optogenetically targeted hypocretin/orexin neurons, which play a key role in arousal processes. We used optogenetics to activate these neurons at different intervals in behaving mice and were able to fragment sleep without affecting its overall amount or intensity. Fragmenting sleep after the learning phase of the novel object recognition (NOR) task significantly decreased the performance of mice on the subsequent day, but memory was unaffected if the average duration of sleep episodes was maintained at 62-73% of normal. These findings demonstrate the use of optogenetic activation of arousal-related nuclei as a way to systematically manipulate a specific feature of sleep. We conclude that regardless of the total amount of sleep or sleep intensity, a minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep is crucial for memory consolidation.",Excluded
2973,"Fractional anisotropy dose-response relationship of the corpus callosum. Purpose or Objective: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive modality for determination of water diffusion properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA) quantifies the extent of directionality of water diffusion. We investigated absorbed dose as a predictor of FA change in the corpus callosum (CC) following radiation therapy for high grade glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with high-grade glioma underwent DTI scans before, and ten months after radiation therapy to 59.4-60 Gy. Diffusion data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Using an automated white matter fiber tracking technique, 23 fiber tracts were segmented on the baseline and follow-up DTI images. The CT images used for treatment planning and both DTI image sets were aligned using non-linear registration. This way, the baseline FA, the follow-up FA, and the absorbed dose could be determined for each voxel in all 15 patients. For each voxel in the CC, we calculated the FA change as FA follow-up /FA baseline and dichotomized the data into a binary outcome variable using 0.5 as cutoff. For all 15 patients, logistic regression was used to determine dose-response curve parameters (D50 and g50) and their confidence intervals (CIs). We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminative ability of the voxel dose. Then, we estimated dose-response curve parameters and calculated the AUC for each patient individually. Result(s): The median age was 59 (range: 40-85) years. The average CC volume and average CC mean absorbed dose was 62+/-8 cm3 and 26+/-14 Gy (1 SD), respectively. Using data from 99 691 voxels, the estimated parameters for the doseresponse curve for all patients (upper panel in Figure 1) were D50=88.0+/-0.1 Gy and gamma50=0.80+/-0.01 (95% CIs). The AUC was 0.71 indicating good discriminative ability. For nine out of 15 patients, the individual AUC was >=0.60, indicating that higher absorbed dose is associated with higher probability of FA change >=0.5. Dose -response curves for those patients are shown in the lower panel in Figure 1 and their estimated parameter values in Table 1. Individual D50s varied between 41.3 and 125.9 Gy. Conclusion(s): Absorbed dose was a significant predictor of FA change in the CC. This was the case both when all patients were pooled for analysis, and in nine out of 15 patients when analyzed separately. More detailed analyses are needed to better understand the effect radiation has on water diffusion in brain white matter. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

112,"Evaluation of radiochromic gel dosimetry and polymer gel dosimetry in a clinical dose verification. A quantitative comparison of two full three-dimensional (3D) gel dosimetry techniques was assessed in a clinical setting: radiochromic gel dosimetry with an in-house developed optical laser CT scanner and polymer gel dosimetry with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To benchmark both gel dosimeters, they were exposed to a 6 MV photon beam and the depth dose was compared against a diamond detector measurement that served as golden standard. Both gel dosimeters were found accurate within 4% accuracy. In the 3D dose matrix of the radiochromic gel, hotspot dose deviations up to 8% were observed which are attributed to the fabrication procedure. The polymer gel readout was shown to be sensitive to B0 field and B1 field non-uniformities as well as temperature variations during scanning. The performance of the two gel dosimeters was also evaluated for a brain tumour IMRT treatment. Both gel measured dose distributions were compared against treatment planning system predicted dose maps which were validated independently with ion chamber measurements and portal dosimetry. In the radiochromic gel measurement, two sources of deviations could be identified. Firstly, the dose in a cluster of voxels near the edge of the phantom deviated from the planned dose. Secondly, the presence of dose hotspots in the order of 10% related to inhomogeneities in the gel limit the clinical acceptance of this dosimetry technique. Based on the results of the micelle gel dosimeter prototype presented here, chemical optimization will be subject of future work. Polymer gel dosimetry is capable of measuring the absolute dose in the whole 3D volume within 5% accuracy. A temperature stabilization technique is incorporated to increase the accuracy during short measurements, however keeping the temperature stable during long measurement times in both calibration phantoms and the volumetric phantom is more challenging. The sensitivity of MRI readout to minimal temperature fluctuations is demonstrated which proves the need for adequate compensation strategies.",Excluded

Linopirdine [DuP 996; 3,3-bis(4-pyrindinylmethyl)-1-phenylindolin-2-one] represents a novel class of compounds which enhance depolarization-activated (but not basal) release of acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin in brain slices and improve learning and memory in rodents. The effects of linopiridine on local cerebral glucose metabolism were studied by the quantitative autoradiographic 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose method. Linopirdine administration in naive rats (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) did not significantly alter cerebral glucose metabolism in any of the regions analyzed. Since linopirdine protects against hypoxia-induced passive avoidance deficits in rats, we also examined the effects of linopirdine on cerebral metabolism after the rats were exposed to 30 min of hypoxia. Glucose metabolism was not significantly altered after hypoxic exposure, except for a small increase in some brain regions. Linopirdine administered after hypoxia decreased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus, limbic cortex, ventral hippocampal commissure, medial septum, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta, lateral habenula, cerebral cortex, cerebellar vermis and a few thalamic nuclei. Statistically significant effects of linopirdine on glucose metabolism were observed in 22 of 56 brain regions sampled. In hypoxia-exposed rats, linopirdine altered glucose metabolism in brain regions that are implicated in learning and memory and are affected in Alzheimer's disease. Several of the affected regions are associated with the cholinergic system and may play a role in the cognitive enhancing properties of linopirdine.",Excluded

METHOD(S): Between December 1993 and January 2000, 47 patients with vestibular schwannomas were treated at our center with gamma knife radiosurgery. The marginal tumor doses ranged from 7.5 to 14.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients treated after microsurgery and from 10.0 to 15.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients in whom radiosurgery was the primary treatment. The median maximum tumor diameter was 18 mm (range, 3-50 mm). Evaluation included audiometry, neurological examination, and serial imaging tests. A survey was conducted at the time of analysis. RESULT(S): Follow-up data were available for 45 patients and ranged from 1 to 7 years (median, 3.6 yr). In 43 patients (96%), tumor control (no radiographic progression or surgical resection) was observed. All 33 previously untreated patients had tumor control. Transient facial weakness, experienced in two patients (4%), had resolved completely within 6 months. No patient developed trigeminal neuropathy. Hearing was diminished from baseline in 12% of patients with useful hearing (Gardner-Robertson Class III). However, all patients with pretreatment hearing Gardner-Robertson Class I or II maintained testable hearing (Class I to III) at the most recent examination. CONCLUSION(S): Low-dose radiosurgery in this series provided comparable local control and decreased incidences of complications in relation to other reports. Additional follow-up will allow more definitive conclusions to be reached regarding the ultimate rates of tumor control and hearing preservation. Nevertheless, the current dose used for vestibular schwannomas at the University of Maryland Medical Center is 12.0 Gy to the tumor periphery.",Excluded
1985,"Two stages of light-dependent TRPL-channel translocation in Drosophila photoreceptors. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels across species are expressed in sensory receptor cells, and often localized to specialized subcellular sites. In Drosophila photoreceptors, TRP-like (TRPL) channels are localized to the signaling compartment, the rhabdomere, in the dark, and undergo light-induced translocation into the cell body as a mechanism for long-term light-adaptation. We show that translocation of TRPL channels occurs in two distinct stages, first to the neighboring stalk membrane then to the basolateral membrane. In the first stage, light-induced translocation occurs within 5 minutes, whereas the second stage takes over 6 hours. The exclusive apical localization of TRPL channels in the first stage of translocation suggests that channels are released from the rhabdomere and diffuse laterally through the membrane into the adjoining stalk membrane. In the second stage, TRPL channels are localized in the basolateral membrane, implicating a different transport mechanism. Genetic analyses suggest that activation of the other light-activated TRP channel and eye-protein-kinase C (eye-PKC) are both required for the second stage of TRPL translocation in R1 to R6 photoreceptor cells, whereas only phospholipase C (PLC) is required for the first stage. Finally, we show that arrestin2 is required for the rhabdomeric localization and stability of TRPL channels.",Excluded

All but one (chloramphenicol) of these bioactive reagents substantially retarded the recovery and increased the death rate of such ""dark"" neurons. As concerns the dehydrating drugs and ion channel modulators, these effects are considered to be consequences of the fact that relatively large volumes (more than half of the original cell volume) of cytoplasmic fluid (water molecules, inorganic ions and metabolites) leave the affected cells through passive pores within a few minutes. The effects of the mitochondrial enzyme inhibitors appear to indicate that restoration of the original cell volume (recovery) demands metabolic (enzyme-mediated) energy. All these features support our previous assumption that the exogenous circumstances existing acutely after the formation of ""dark"" neurons in neurological diseases decide whether they will recover or die.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate autonomic control in groups of European and Chinese astronauts and to identify similarities and differences.METHODS: Beat-to-beat heart rate and finger blood pressure, brachial blood pressure, and respiratory frequency were measured from 10 astronauts (five European taking part in three different space missions and five Chinese astronauts taking part in two different space missions). Data recording was performed in the supine and standing positions at least 10 days before launch, and 1, 3, and 10 days after return. Cross-correlation analysis of heart rate and systolic pressure was used to assess cardiac baroreflex modulation. A fixed breathing protocol was performed to measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency power of systolic blood pressure variability.RESULTS: Although baseline cardiovascular parameters before spaceflight were similar in all astronauts in the supine position, a significant increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in vagal modulation occurred in the European astronauts when standing; spaceflight resulted in a remarkable vagal decrease in European astronauts only. Similar baseline supine and standing values for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory frequency were shown in both groups. Standing autonomic control was based on a balance of higher vagal and sympathetic modulation in European astronauts.CONCLUSION: Post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was observed in all European astronauts, whereas post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was significantly reduced in Chinese astronauts.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to maternal stress in utero has long-term implications for the developing brain and has been linked with a higher risk of depression. The amygdala, which develops during the early embryonic stage and is critical for emotion processing, might be particularly sensitive.METHODS: Using data from a neuroimaging follow-up of the ELSPAC prenatal birth cohort (n=129, 47% men, 23-24 years old), we studied the impact of prenatal stress during the first and second half of pregnancy on the volume of the amygdala and its nuclei in young adult offspring. We further evaluated the relationship between amygdala anatomy and offspring depressive symptomatology. Amygdala nuclei were parcellated using FreeSurfer's automated segmentation pipeline. Depressive symptoms were measured via self-report using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).RESULTS: Exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy was associated with smaller accessory basal (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.27, p(FDR)=0.03) and cortical (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.29, p(FDR)=0.03) nuclei volumes. This effect remained significant after correcting for sex, stress during the second half of pregnancy, as well as maternal age at birth, birth weight, maternal education, and offspring's age at MRI. These two nuclei showed a quadratic relationship with BDI scores in young adulthood, where both smaller and larger volume was associated with more depressive symptoms (Accessory basal nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.05. p(FDR)=0.015; Cortical nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.04, p(FDR)=0.015).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy might have long-term implications for amygdala anatomy, which may in turn predict the experience of depressive symptoms in young adulthood.",Excluded

3323,"Defining the mechanisms that underlie cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons, heralded by the development of cortical hyperexcitability. Reduction of short interval intracortical inhibition [SICI] in ALS, a feature linked to the development of cortical hyperexcitability, may be mediated by degeneration of inhibitory circuits or alternatively activation of high threshold excitatory circuits. As such, determining the mechanisms of SICI reduction in ALS has clear diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Consequently, the present study utilized a novel threshold tracking paired-pulse paradigm to determine whether SICI reduction in ALS represented reduced inhibition or excessive excitation. Using a 90 mm circular coil, SICI was assessed at three different conditioning stimulus intensities: 40%, 70% and 90% of resting motor threshold [RMT]. Motor evoked potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Short interval intracortical inhibition was uniformly reduced across all three levels of conditioning intensities in ALS [40% RMT, ALS -0.6+/-0.7%, controls 2.0+/-0.6%, P<0.01; 70% RMT, ALS 0.6+/-2.7%, controls 12.8+/-2%, P<0.001; 90% RMT, ALS -15.9+/-1.3%, controls 2.2+/-4.1%, P<0.01]. In addition, the resting motor threshold was reduced, while the motor evoked potential amplitude was increased in ALS patients, in keeping with cortical hyperexcitability. These findings establish that SICI reduction in ALS represents degeneration of inhibitory cortical circuits, combined with excessive excitation of high threshold excitatory pathways. Neuroprotective strategies aimed at preserving the integrity of intracortical inhibitory circuits, in addition to antagonizing excitatory cortical circuits, may provide novel therapeutic targets in ALS.",Excluded
1300,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated pathway of leptin to regulate feeding, adiposity, and uncoupling protein expression in mice. To examine the functional role of CRH in the regulation of energy homeostasis by leptin, we measured the effects of the CRH antagonist, alpha-helical CRH 8-41 (alphaCRH) on a number of factors affected by leptin activity. These included food intake, body weight, hypothalamic c-fos-like immunoreactivity (c-FLI), weight and histological characterization of white adipose tissue, and mRNA expressions of uncoupling protein (UCP) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in C57Bl/6 mice. Central infusion of leptin into the lateral cerebroventricle (icv) caused significant induction of c-FLI in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and arcuate nucleus. In all these nuclei, the effect of leptin on expression of cFLI in the PVN and VMH was decreased by treatment with alphaCRH. Administration of leptin markedly decreased cumulative food intake and body weight with this effect being attenuated by pretreatment with alphaCRH. In peripheral tissue, leptin up-regulated BAT UCP1 mRNA expression and reduced fat depositions in this tissue. Those changes in BAT were also decreased by treatment with alphaCRH. As a consequence of the effects on food intake or energy expenditure, treatment with alphaCRH attenuated the leptin-induced reduction of body adiposity, fat cell size, triglyceride contents, and ob mRNA expression in white adipose tissue. Taken together, these results indicate that CRH neurons in the PVN and VMH may be an important mediator for leptin that contribute to regulation of feeding, adiposity, and UCP expression.",Excluded
2603,"2.45 GHz microwave radiation impairs learning, memory, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the rat. Microwave (MW) radiation has a close relationship with neurobehavioral disorders. Due to the widespread usage of MW radiation, especially in our homes, it is essential to investigate the direct effect of MW radiation on the central nervous system. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the effect of MW radiation on memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The rats were exposed to 2.45 GHz MW radiation (continuous wave with overall average power density of 0.016 mW/cm2 and overall average whole-body specific absorption rate value of 0.017 W/kg) for 2 h/day over a period of 40 days. Spatial learning and memory were tested by radial maze and passive avoidance tests. We evaluated the synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neuronal cells number by field potential recording and Giemsa staining, respectively. Our results showed that MW radiation exposure decreased the learning and memory performance that was associated with decrement of long-term potentiation induction and excitability of CA1 neurons. However, MW radiation did not have any effects on short-term plasticity and paired-pulse ratio as a good indirect index for measurement of glutamate release probability. The evaluation of hippocampal morphology indicated that the neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 area was significantly decreased by MW.",Excluded
522,"Health-related quality of life and rates of toxicity after high-dose-rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer. Purpose: High-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a common treatment option for locally advanced prostate cancer. Quality of life is an important factor when discussing therapy options for high-risk prostate cancer. This study evaluated adverse effects and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).Materials and Methods: Ninety male patients (median age, 71 years; range, 50 to 79 years) with high-risk prostate cancer underwent HDR-BT after EBRT between December 2009 and January 2017 with a median follow-up of 43 months. A total of 57 patients (69.5%) answered the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life of Cancer Patients questionnaire (QLQ-C30; ver. 3.0), and 8 patients died during follow-up. In order to put the results of this study in context, we compared the results with reference data from the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Correlations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, International Prostate Symptom Score, and HRQOL measures were calculated.Results: The study participants reported better physical functioning and better global health compared with the reference data, but worse social, role, and cognitive functioning. We found negative statistically significant correlations between the last-measured PSA value and social functioning (p>0.01), cognitive functioning, pain, and constipation (all p<0.05). Toxicity rates were 10.0% for gastrointestinal and 12.2% for genitourinary adverse effects. All reported complications for toxicity were Grade I.Conclusions: The described therapy results in high biochemical control rates with minimal adverse effects. Compared with reference groups, the HRQOL of this study cohort was acceptable. PSA values during follow-up seem to be a possible indicator to influence HRQOL.",Excluded

1977,"Proton beam radiotherapy: Report of the first patient treated at the Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO). Proton beam radiotherapy, an innovative treatment modality, allows delivery of high radiation doses to the target while sparing surrounding healthy structures. The Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO), equipped with a synchrotron and capable of using both protons and ions, initiated its clinical activity in September 2011. The first treatment of a skull base tumor with protons is reported here. The case of a 26-year-old man with an intracranial low-grade chondrosarcoma of the right petroclival junction is discussed with emphasis on technical and clinical details. Two previous surgical interventions had achieved partial removal of the tumor and the patient was treated with protons for residual disease. The prescribed dose was 70 GyE in 35 fractions of 2 GyE. Treatment was completed with minimal acute toxicity consisting of grade 1 alopecia and nausea. Nine months after treatment the disease is locally controlled. Use of high-energy protons at CNAO is a safe and effective means of treating a tumor located near critical normal structures. © - Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore downloaded by ELSEVIER BV IP.",Excluded
865,"Non-linear, high-gain and sustained-to-transient signal transmission from rods to amacrine cells in dark-adapted retina of Ambystoma. In darkness, On-Off amacrine cells (ACs) of the tiger salamander retina exhibited large spontaneous transient depolarizing potentials (sTDPs) with average peak amplitude of 5.05 +/- 2.5 mV and average frequency of 0.42 +/- 0.25 s(-1). Under voltage-clamp conditions the cell displayed large spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) with average peak amplitude of 98 +/- 39 pA and average frequency of 0.45 +/- 0.22 s(-1). To a light step, ACs gave rise to a transient 'On' response at the light onset and a transient 'Off' response at light offset, followed by a train of TDPs ('After' response). Near the response threshold (0.3 activated rhodopsin molecules per rod per second), light-evoked TDPs (leTDPs) of similar amplitude and kinetics as the large sTDPs observed in darkness were seen, and about half of these leTDPs elicited a regenerative potential (RP). Brighter light steps gave rise to more leTDPs and higher rates of RPs in the On, Off and After responses. Within the linear response range of the rods, the AC response was non-linear, with the highest gain (676 +/- 429) near the dark potential. The amplitude of Off responses increased with the duration of the light step, and ACs may use this to encode speeds of moving stimuli: the faster the light object moves, the smaller the AC Off response. Moreover, the number of leTDPs in the AC After response increased with light intensity, and the onset of the After response coincides with bipolar cell tail response recovery. One possible origin of the large sTDPs and leTDPs is the spontaneous and depolarization-induced regenerative calcium potentials (RCaPs) in bipolar cell synaptic terminals. RCaPs in bipolar cell synaptic terminals cause transient glutamate release that results in the sTDPs in darkness, and leTDPs in On, Off and After responses in ACs.",Excluded
23,"Local control of high-grade gliomas with limited volume irradiation versus whole brain irradiation. INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the role of limited field radiation therapy in the management of high-grade gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).MATERIAL AND METHODS: From July '96 to January '98, 50 newly diagnosed patients of high-grade gliomas (Grade III and IV) and glioblastoma multiforme who underwent surgery in the form of partial, sub-total or near-total excision as the primary treatment were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized to receive two different postoperative external radiation protocols, Study Group A: Localized field external radiotherapy 50 Gy/25#/5 wks followed by Boost 10 Gy/5#/1 wk, Control Group B: Whole brain external radiotherapy 40 Gy/20#/4 wks followed by Boost 20 Gy/10#/2 wks by localized field.RESULTS: 20/25 (80%) patients in the study group and 14/25 (56%) patients in the control group showed improvement in their Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Thus a significant difference in the performance status was noted in favor of limited field irradiation. No significant difference in the local response was seen between the two groups after radiotherapy. Six months progression-free survival of the study group was 44% as compared to 26% in the control group. Six months overall survival was 66.67% in the study group and 50.72% in the control group (P<0.01). Maximum recurrences were noticed within 2 cm of the original tumor margin in both the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Although local control and survival of the patient in both the groups were same, performance status definitely improved in patients treated with localized field irradiation only.",Excluded
82,"Acute vagus nerve stimulation using different pulse widths produces varying brain effects. BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and has been investigated in clinical trials of depression. Little is known about the relationship of VNS parameters to brain function. Using the interleaved VNS /functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we tested whether variations of VNS pulse width (PW) would produce different immediate brain activation in a manner consistent with single neuron PW studies.METHODS: Twelve adult patients with major depression, treated with VNS, underwent three consecutive VNS/fMRI scans, each randomly using one of three PWs (130 micros, 250 micros, or 500 micros). The data were analyzed with SPM2.RESULTS: Global activations induced by PWs 250 and 500 were both significantly greater than that induced by PW 130 but not significantly different from each other. For global deactivation, PWs 130 and 250 were both significantly greater than PW 500 but not significantly different from each other. Regional similarities and differences were also seen with the various PWs.CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm our hypothesis that VNS at PW 500 globally produces no more activation than does PW 250, and PW 130 is insufficient for activation of some regions. These data suggest that PW is an important variable in producing VNS brain effects.",Excluded

1850,"Melatonin: A Potential Anti-Oxidant Therapeutic Agent for Mitochondrial Dysfunctions and Related Disorders. Mitochondria play a central role in cellular physiology. Besides their classic function of energy metabolism, mitochondria are involved in multiple cell functions, including energy distribution through the cell, energy/heat modulation, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium homeostasis, and control of apoptosis. Simultaneously, mitochondria are the main producer and target of ROS with the result that multiple mitochondrial diseases are related to ROS-induced mitochondrial injuries. Increased free radical generation, enhanced mitochondrial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production, decreased respiratory complex activity, impaired electron transport system, and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores have all been suggested as factors responsible for impaired mitochondrial function. Because of these, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and aging, are caused by ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Melatonin, the major hormone of the pineal gland, also acts as an anti-oxidant and as a regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetic function. Melatonin is selectively taken up by mitochondrial membranes, a function not shared by other anti-oxidants, and thus has emerged as a major potential therapeutic tool for treating neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown the protective role of melatonin for preventing oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction seen in experimental models of PD, AD, and HD. With these functions in mind, this article reviews the protective role of melatonin with mechanistic insights against mitochondrial diseases and suggests new avenues for safe and effective treatment modalities against these devastating neurodegenerative diseases. Future insights are also discussed. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",Excluded

2789,"Human glycine alpha1 receptor inhibition by quercetin is abolished or inversed by alpha267 mutations in transmembrane domain 2. Quercetin, one of the flavonoids, is a compound of low molecular weight found in fruits and vegetables. Besides its antioxidative effect, quercetin also shows a wide range of diverse neuropharmacological actions. However, the cellular mechanisms of quercetin's actions, especially on ligand-gated ion channels and synaptic transmissions, are not well studied. We investigated the effect of quercetin on the human glycine alpha1 receptor channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Application of quercetin reversibly inhibited glycine-induced current (I(Gly)). Quercetin's inhibition depends on its dose, with an IC(50) of 21.5+/-.2 microM. The inhibition was sensitive to membrane voltages. Site-directed mutations of S267 to S267Y but not S267A, S267F, S267G, S267K, S267L and S267T at transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) nearly abolished quercetin-induced inhibition of I(Gly). In contrast, in site-directed mutant receptors such as S267 to S267I, S267R and S267V, quercetin enhanced I(Gly) compared to the wild-type receptor. The EC(50) was 22.6+/-1.4, 25.5+/-4.2, and 14.5+/-3.1 microM for S267I, S267R and S267V, respectively.

329,"Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for central neurocytoma. Purpose/Objective(s): Central neurocytomas are intraventricular neoplasms of the central nervous system that comprise 0.25- 0.5% of brain tumors and their optimal management remains controversial due to their rarity. We assessed clinical outcome for a historical cohort of neurocytoma patients and evaluated effects of tumor atypia, tumor size, extent of resection (EOR), and adjuvant radiation (RT). Materials/Methods: Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from date of first surgical resection. Differences in PFS were measured by Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard ratio methods. Tumor atypia was defined as MIB-1 index >2%, focal necrosis, or microvascular proliferation, as previously established. Result(s): A total of 22 patients (14 males, 8 females) were treated between 1995 and 2009, with a median age at diagnosis of 24 years (range 11-62). A total of 8 patients experienced recurrent/progressive disease. Median follow-up by MRI was 38 month (range 0.1-183) for those who have not progressed. Overall 3-yr PFS was 70% (CI 41-86%). Only three patients died and all had atypical tumors. For the remaining patients, median follow-up for survival was 51 month (range 0.1-183). We examined effects of tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling. Ten of 22 tumors had atypical features. There was near 100% concordance between tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling: only 1 tumor was atypical based on microvascular proliferation but had MIB-1 <= 2%. Three-year PFS was 78% for MIB labeling <= 2% and 39% for MIB labeling >2% (HR 7.7, CI 2 - 40, p = 0.016). Median tumor diameter was 4.3 cm (range 0.8-8.6 cm). Three-yr PFS was 48% (CI 21-77%) for tumor >4.3 cm and 74.1% (CI 29-93%) for tumor <=4.3 cm (HR 1.6, CI 0.5 - 6.6, p = 0.49). We examined influence of EOR and adjuvant RT. Five patients had gross total resection (GTR), and 17 had subtotal resection (STR). No patient had a biopsy only. Seven patients progressed after STR, and one patient recurred after GTR. None of the GTR patients received adjuvant RT and four of the STR patients received adjuvant RT. Three-year PFS rates by extent of resection and adjuvant RT are shown (in table below). Conclusion(s): For patients with central neurocytoma, MIB-1 labeling index >2% significantly predicts worse outcome. The additional criteria for tumor atypia did not add useful prognostic information.

729,"Normal intima-media thickness on carotid ultrasound reliably excludes an ischemic cause of cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Patients with ischemia as the cause of LVSD may warrant revascularization. Angiography is the most accurate method of CAD diagnosis but is invasive, expensive, and associated with some risk. Noninvasive imaging for CAD often involves expensive equipment, radiation exposure, medication, and/or contrast administration. Carotid ultrasound with measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) is safe and inexpensive. Carotid IMT is well correlated with the presence of CAD. We assessed the accuracy of carotid ultrasound for identification of CAD as a potential etiology of LVSD.METHODS: Patients with LVSD (ejection fraction < or =40%) of uncertain etiology referred for angiography underwent carotid ultrasound. Patients with history of myocardial infarction were excluded. Two experienced cardiologists blinded to CAD status determined common carotid artery (CCA) IMT and plaque. Significant CAD was defined as > or =50% stenosis of any major artery. Ischemic LVSD was defined as (1) left main and/or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery > or =75% or (2) > or =2 major arteries with > or =75% stenosis.RESULTS: Mean ejection fraction was 27% +/- 10% in 150 patients. Significant CAD was found in 64 (42.7%) and ischemic LVSD in 40 (26.7%). Carotid plaque was seen in 95 (63.3%). Mean CCA IMT was > or =0.9 mm in 69 (46.0%).

2774,"Electromagnetic interference in intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials and a wireless solution. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is utilized to minimize neurological morbidity during spine surgery. Transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) are principal IONM signals in which the motor cortex of the subject is stimulated with electrical pulses and the evoked potentials are recorded from the muscles of interest. Currently available monitoring systems require the connection of 40-60 lengthy lead wires to the patient. These wires contribute to a crowded and cluttered surgical environment, and limit the maneuverability of the surgical team. In this work, it was demonstrated that the cumbersome wired system is vulnerable to electromagnetic interference (EMI) produced by operating room (OR) equipment. It was hypothesized that eliminating the lengthy recording wires can remove the EMI induced in the IONM signals. Hence, a wireless system to acquire TcMEPs was developed and validated through bench-top and animal experiments. Side-by-side TcMEPs acquisition from the wired and wireless systems in animal experiments under controlled conditions (absence of EMI from OR equipment) showed comparable magnitudes and waveforms, thus demonstrating the fidelity in the signal acquisition of the wireless solution. The robustness of the wireless system to minimize EMI was compared with a wired-system under identical conditions. Unlike the wired-system, the wireless system was not influenced by the electromagnetic waves from the C-Arm X-ray machine and temperature management system in the OR.

903,"Long-term depression is not modulated by ATP receptors in the rat CA1 hippocampal region. ATP is an important extracellular messenger in the CNS. In the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for learning and memory processes, it acts both as a modulator and as a mediator of synaptic transmission, with implications for synaptic plasticity phenomena. Recent evidence suggests that ATP modulates activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, it remains unclear if ATP also modulates LTP counterpart's phenomenon, long-term depression (LTD), in the rat hippocampus. This study investigated the effect of ATP analogues on homosynaptic LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (1 Hz; 900 pulses) in the CA1 region of young rat hippocampal slices. The metabolically stable ATP analogues beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM), a P2 receptor agonist, and alpha,beta-MeATP (20 microM), a preferential P2X(1,3) receptor agonist, did not modify LTD (LTD values of 14.7+/-0.5% and 14.1+/-3% for aCSF controls and of 15.1+/-4% and 19.0+/-5.2% for beta,gamma-ImATP and alpha,beta-MeATP, respectively).

Objective: To report a rare case of glioblastoma arising from trigeminal nerve with leptomeningeal spread of disease, and discuss the origin of this tumor. Background(s): Glioblastoma (GB) is a WHO Grade IV tumor typically arising in the supratentorial compartment of the brain. Gliomas arising from cranial nerves (CN) are extremely rare. Design/Methods: A 77 year old gentleman presented with four month history of numbness over the right side of his face and progressive bilateral hearing loss. One week prior to presentation, he also developed left facial weakness, left eye ptosis, diplopia and lower back pain. On examination, he was found to have loss of sensation in a V1-V3 distribution on the right, a left pupil sparing third nerve palsy, bilateral sensironeural hearing loss, and a left peripheral VII CN palsy Results: MRI brain showed a cisternal mass infiltrating the right CN V with extensive enhancement and thickening of bilateral CN including III, V, VII, and VIII. MRI of the spine showed nodular enhancement at the level of the cauda equina. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Biopsy of the right CN V mass showed this to be glioblastoma. Conclusion(s): Leptomeningeal dissemination of glioblastoma is rare, occurring in about 4% of cases. In most of these cases, a parenchymal component is present that eventually disseminates along the ependymal lining of the brain to involve the leptomeninges. We here describe a unique presentation of a GB most likely arising from a CN followed by widespread leptomeningeal dissemination. The root entry zone (either the glial segment or the transition segment) of the cranial nerve is thought to be the anatomical point of origin for gliomas arising from CNs. Unfortunately despite being treated with radiation and chemotherapy, the patient passed away 3 months after presentation denoting the very poor prognosis associated with leptomeningeal spread of GB.",Excluded
388,"A bayesian adaptive randomized phase ii trial of bevacizumab versus bevacizumab plus vorinostat in adults with recurrent glioblastoma final results. BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab improves outcome and reduces symptoms in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). However, GBMs develop adaptive resistance to bevacizumab- mediated angiogenesis inhibition resulting in tumor recurrence. We hypothesized that vorinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, with pleotropic antiangiogenic effects, would delay emergence of resistance to bevacizumab therapy and improve clinical outcome. METHOD(S): In this multicenter phase II trial utilizing a novel Bayesian design, patients with recurrent glioblastoma were adaptively randomized to bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab+vorinostat based on a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) such that patients had a higher likelihood of receiving the more efficacious treatment. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and quality of life assessment (MDASI-BT). Eligible patients were adults (>= 18 yrs) with histologically confirmed GBMs recurrent after prior radiation and temozolomide therapy, adequate organ function, KPS>= 60, and no prior bevacizumab/HDAC inhibitors. RESULT(S): Ninety patients (bevacizumab+vorinostat:49, bevacizumab:41) were enrolled and 74 were evaluable for PFS (bevacizumab+vorinostat:44, bevacizumab:30). Grade 3 or greater toxicities in 85 evaluable patients included hypertension (n=37), neurological changes (n=2), anorexia (n=2), infections (n=9), wound dehiscence (n=2), DVT/PE (n=2), and colonic perforation (n=1). There was one treatment-related death due to pulmonary embolism. Upon multivariate analysis for bevacizumab+vorinostat vs bevacizumab, median PFS (3.7 vs. 3.9 months, p=0.94, HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.38, 1.06, p=0.08]) or median OS (7.8 vs. 9.3 months, p=0.64, HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.5, 1.6, p=0.79]) were not significantly different between the two arms. Ongoing analyses of patient reported outcomes (MDASI-BT) and plasma biomarkers will be reported. CONCLUSION(S): Combining bevacizumab with vorinostat did not result in improved PFS or OS compared with bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent GBM.

PURPOSE: Although gene expression profiling provides critical information, knowledge remains limited regarding the differential effects of molecular subtype on clinical course. This study evaluated the impact of molecular status on long-term patterns of failure in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We analyzed data from 1181 individuals with invasive breast cancer undergoing surgery plus PORT from 2003 to 2011. Molecular subtypes were defined as luminal A (LA), luminal B (LB)-HER2(-), LB-HER2(+), HER2, and triple-negative (TN) based on the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus criteria. Competing risks analysis and baseline hazard rate function plots were used to explore subtype-specific recurrence patterns.RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival rates of LA, LB-HER2(-), LB-HER2(+), HER2, and TN groups were 96, 93, 94, 84, and 85%, respectively (P < 0.001). Distant metastatic events differed significantly according to molecular subtype (P < 0.001). In competing risks regression analysis, initial development of distant metastasis was the highest with TN tumors, followed by HER2, LB-HER2(-), and LB-HER2(+) subtypes (P = 0.005). Regarding preferential sites of distant metastasis, the risk of initial brain metastasis was significantly higher with HER2 tumors, followed by TN tumors (P = 0.001). A low-level but sustained metastatic risk increment was observed in luminal tumors, whereas TN and HER2 subtypes showed a short-term risk surge within 5 years.CONCLUSION: From the significant impact of molecular profile on distant metastasis, subtype-specific individualization of systemic treatment and close surveillance are suggested. The preferential and long-term risk of brain metastasis in the HER2 subtype underlines the importance of alternative anti-HER2 therapies.",Excluded

However, little is known about the quantitative effects on motor behavior of unilateral STN DBS.METHODS: In 52 PD subjects with STN DBS, we quantified in a double-blinded manner rigidity (n=42), bradykinesia (n=38), and gait speed (n=45). Subjects were tested in four DBS conditions: both on, left on, right on and both off. A force transducer was used to measure rigidity across the elbow, and gyroscopes were used to measure angular velocity of hand rotations for bradykinesia. About half of the subjects were rated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (part III) motor scores for arm rigidity and repetitive hand rotation simultaneously during the kinematic measurements. Subjects were timed walking 25 feet.RESULTS: All subjects had significant improvement with bilateral STN DBS. Contralateral, ipsilateral and bilateral stimulation significantly reduced rigidity and bradykinesia. Bilateral stimulation improved rigidity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, but there was no significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. Although bilateral stimulation also increased hand rotation velocity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, contralateral stimulation increased hand rotation significantly more than ipsilateral stimulation. All stimulation conditions improved walking time but bilateral stimulation provided the greatest improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral STN DBS decreased rigidity and bradykinesia contralaterally as well ipsilaterally. As expected, bilateral DBS improved gait more than unilateral DBS.",Excluded
2314,"[Effect of scattering and spatial resolution on SPECT quantification values: experimental study using phantoms and clinical application]. The relative SPECT values are often inaccurate by the scattering and limited spatial resolution of single photon emission CT (SPECT). These effects were studied using phantoms and some attentions on clinical application were investigated. Using cylindrical phantom divided into six compartments filled with various radioactivities, the linear correlation between SPECT value and radioactivity, and also correlation with partial reduction of radioactivity were identified. But the SPECT value was relatively increased in proportion to the reduction of radioactivity due to the increase of scattering contribution. The SPECT value represented lower radioactivity when the cortical thickness was smaller than two times of FWHM and represented half radioactivity when the cortical thickness was equal to FWHM. Excellent correlation between SPECT value and radioactive partial volume averaging of brain with CSF was recognized using our hand made phantom simulating various degree of atrophic brain. It is very important to compare SPECT image with X-CT or MR image to avoid misreading taking the above mentioned effects due to scattering and limited spatial resolution.",Excluded
3052,"The effect of ultraviolet B irradiation on nitric oxide synthase expression in murine keratinocytes. Nitric oxide (NO), which has several physiological functions in skin, is generated by NO synthase (NOS). NOS has at least three isoforms; endothelial NOS (eNOS), brain NOS (bNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation has been reported to stimulate NO production in skin via induction or activation of NOS, however, the exact mechanism of NOS induction by UVB irradiation remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the direct effect of UVB on the expression of NOS isoforms in murine keratinocytes, and found a significant increase in NO production within 48 h. mRNA and protein expressions of bNOS were both enhanced by UVB irradiation in murine keratinocytes, whereas iNOS mRNA expression was suppressed at 4 and 12 h after UVB irradiation. These results suggest that the enhancement of NO production observed after UVB irradiation in murine keratinocytes may be explained in part by the upregulation of bNOS expression, but not iNOS expression.",Excluded
2260,"Nitric oxide transiently converts synaptic inhibition to excitation in retinal amacrine cells. Nitric oxide (NO) is generated by multiple cell types in the vertebrate retina, including amacrine cells. We investigate the role of NO in the modulation of synaptic function using a culture system containing identified retinal amacrine cells. We find that moderate concentrations of NO alter GABA(A) receptor function to produce an enhancement of the GABA-gated current. Higher concentrations of NO also enhance GABA-gated currents, but this enhancement is primarily due to a substantial positive shift in the reversal potential of the current. Several pieces of evidence, including a similar effect on glycine-gated currents, indicate that the positive shift is due to an increase in cytosolic Cl-. This change in the chloride distribution is especially significant because it can invert the sign of GABA- and glycine-gated voltage responses. Furthermore, current- and voltage-clamp recordings from synaptic pairs of GABAergic amacrine cells demonstrate that NO transiently converts signaling at GABAergic synapses from inhibition to excitation. Persistence of the NO-induced shift in E(Cl-) in the absence of extracellular Cl- indicates that the increase in cytosolic Cl- is due to release of Cl- from an internal store. An NO-dependent release of Cl- from an internal store is also demonstrated for rat hippocampal neurons indicating that this mechanism is not restricted to the avian retina. Thus signaling in the CNS can be fundamentally altered by an NO-dependent mobilization of an internal Cl- store.",Excluded
1138,"Patient dosimetric evaluation in angiography practice: Application in interventional neuroradiology. Purpose: To evaluate the risk of a deterministic skin injury from Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures, the Peak Skin Dose (PSD) and the skin dose mapping should be estimate. Dose metrics commonly available such as cumulative air kerma at the interventional reference point (Ka,irp) are usually employed. However, as the PSD may be substantially different from Ka,irp, it is necessary to estimate the PSD and skin dose mapping more accurately. Material(s) and Method(s): A custom made MatLab code has been developed; its output is the PSD and a visual display of the surface dose mapped onto a spherical or cylindrical phantom modeling the head or the trunk of the patient respectively. The code works by translating the Ka,irp (corrected by back-scatter factor) to the location of the patient's skin, represented by a surface of the geometrical model and using dosimetric and geometric parameters (primary and secondary angles of the two tubes, longitudinal displacement of the bed) for each radiation event stored in the radiation dose structured report (RDSR). The setting of the dimension of the geometrical phantom depends on the anatomical size of the patient measured from images stored during IR procedures. To validate the code, arrays of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were placed on the phantom surface and on the skin of 9 patients undergoing neuroendovascular treatments, both cerebral and spinal (Artis zee biplane, Siemens). Result(s): The Ka,irp provided by the Angiography System overestimates the measured PSD by more than 50% for head treatments. The percent difference between the PSD calculated and measured by TLD is within 35%. The skin dose mapped on the surface of the geometrical model is in agreement with the dose distribution measured by TLD. Conclusion(s): In Neuro-IR, the use of more detailed information from RDSR can improve the accuracy of the calculated PSD. The implemented algorithm can be applied to evaluate the PSD and skin dose mapping without direct dosimetry. Copyright © 2016",Excluded

We aimed to evaluate the effect of 2100MHz radiofrequency radiation emitted by a generator, simulating a 3G-mobile phone on the brain of rats during 10 and 40 days of exposure. The female rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group I; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group II; control 10 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group III; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks and group IV; control 40 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks. After the genomic DNA content of brain was extracted, oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine, pg/mL) and malondialdehyde (MDA, nmoL/g tissue) levels were determined. Our main finding was the increased oxidative DNA damage to brain after 10 days of exposure with the decreased oxidative DNA damage following 40 days of exposure compared to their control groups. Besides decreased lipid peroxidation end product, MDA, was observed after 40 days of exposure. The measured decreased quantities of damage during the 40 days of exposure could be the means of adapted and increased DNA repair mechanisms.",Excluded

OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) is an effective treatment for intractable trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The authors compared results using two major GKS target points, the dorsal root entry zone and the retrogasserian portion, in a series of patients with intractable TN.METHODS: One hundred patients with medically refractory TN underwent GKS between August 1998 and December 2007. Thirty-seven were men, and 63 were women. The median age at GKS was 74 years. With a single isocenter and use of a 4mm collimator, 51 patients received 80 Gy at the proximal trigeminal nerve (posterior group) and 7 patients received 80 Gy, 1 patient received 85 Gy, and 41 patients received 90 Gy at the retrogasserian portion (anterior group). Follow-up was obtained by clinic visits every 3-6 months after GKS. Data on pain control, complications, and pain recurrence were recorded. The relationships between pain control status, complications, recurrence, and the target portions (anterior vs posterior) were analyzed.RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 3-88 months). Initially, 87 patients achieved pain-free status and 64 achieved complete remission. At the final follow-up visit, 68 patients were still in pain-free status and 42 were in complete remission. Recurrence of facial pain occurred in 15 patients. Forty-one patients developed some degree of trigeminal dysfunction. The rate of initial complete remission was higher in the posterior group than in the anterior group (p = 0.003). More complications were observed in the anterior group than in the posterior group (p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: The posterior targeting group had better pain control and a lower complication rate.

Background: In nuclear medicine, some recent studies have continuously reported that 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) amyloid PET obtained early after intravenous injection (eFBB) reflects blood perfusion and neuronal function to detect Alzheimeras Disease (AD). If eFBB can be used for AD diagnosis, it can help to reduce radiation exposure and increase patient convinnience by discriminating between amyloid nagative AD and positive NC and replacing 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Method(s): We retrospectively collected 264 cases of eFBB, which included amyloid positive NC (25.42%) and negative AD (16.82%). In order to obtain SUVr for analysis, eFBB and dFBB images of each case were spatially registered though CT template and eFBB template, and count normalization was applied to cerebellum, brainstem, and whole brain regions, respectively to identify the best pre-processing step. We evaluated the explanatory power and classification performance of the data according to the intervention of eFBB through logistic regression analysis (LRA) and stratified 4-fold cross validation. For visual observation of the image, we observed the intensity distribution of the image through the t-contrast embedded in the SPM. Result(s): As a result of LRA, the highest explanatory power and classification performance (Nagelkerke R2=0.648, Accuracy=89.4%) were observed when using eFBB template and whole brain region as a reference region. Regardless, when both eFBB and dFBB were known to the model, the explanatory power and classification performance were improved. In evaluating the generalization performance of the selected model, it was also shown that classification performance improved when eFBB was involved in general. When count normalization was performed with Brainstem, It showed the highest performance (84.545%). Conclusion(s): We could confirm the possibility that the early amyloid imaging can help discriminate AD from NC with only single modality of amyloid imaging imaged at early and late phase.",Excluded

Objective This study aims to evaluate dynamic morphological changes of intracranial aneurysms to predict intraoperative aneurysm rupture (IAR) during clipping. Methods Included in this study were 153 patients, who had ruptured and microsurgical-clipped aneurysms. All patients underwent dual-source computed tomography examination of electrocardiography-gated dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography before clipping. Original scanning data were reconstructed to produce 20 data sets of cardiac cycles with 5% time intervals. The aneurysm neck, transverse and longitudinal diameters, and volume from the 20 groups of images were measured to calculate their respective change rates. In addition, other data and clinical characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed by logistic regression to identify factors associated with IAR. Results Of the 153 patients, 24 patients experienced IAR. Multivariable analysis revealed that the aneurysm neck change rate (P = 0.0001; odds ratio, 1.276) and aspect ratio (height/neck ratio, P = 0.025; odds ratio, 2.387) are predictors for IAR. When the change rate was greater than or equal to 60%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 76.7%, respectively. Conclusions Aneurysm neck change rate is independent predictor of IAR.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbon ion radiotherapy is a promising therapeutic option for glioblastoma patients due to its high physical dose conformity and greater biological effectiveness than photons. However, the biological effects of carbon ion radiation are still incompletely understood. Here, we systematically compared the biological effects of clinically used carbon ion radiation to photon radiation with emphasis on DNA repair.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two human glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and LN229) were irradiated with carbon ions or photons and DNA damage response was systematically analyzed, including clonogenic survival, induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), cell cycle arrest and apoptosis or autophagy. gammaH2AX foci were analyzed by flow cytometry, conventional light microscopy and 3D superresolution microscopy.RESULTS: DSBs were repaired delayed and with slower kinetics after carbon ions versus photons. Carbon ions caused stronger and longer-lasting cell cycle delays, predominantly in G2 phase, and a higher rate of apoptosis. Compared to photons, the effectiveness of carbon ions was less cell cycle-dependent. Homologous recombination (HR) appeared to be more important for DSB repair after carbon ions versus photons in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient U87 cells, as opposed to PTEN-proficient LN229 cells.CONCLUSION: Carbon ions induced more severe DSB damage than photons, which was repaired less efficiently in both cell lines. Thus, carbon ion radiotherapy may help to overcome resistance mechanisms of glioblastoma associated with DNA repair for example in combination with repair pathway-specific drugs in the context of personalized radiotherapy.",Excluded
151,"Colored lenses suppress blue light-emitting diode light-induced damage in photoreceptor-derived cells. Blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in liquid crystal displays emit high levels of blue light, exposure to which is harmful to the retina. Here, we investigated the protective effects of colored lenses in blue LED light-induced damage to 661W photoreceptor-derived cells. We used eight kinds of colored lenses and one lens that reflects blue light. Moreover, we evaluated the relationship between the protective effects of the lens and the transmittance of lens at 464 nm. Lenses of six colors, except for the SY, PN, and reflective coating lenses, strongly decreased the reduction in cell damage induced by blue LED light exposure. The deep yellow lens showed the most protective effect from all the lenses, but the reflective coating lens and pink lens did not show any effects on photoreceptor-derived cell damage. Moreover, these results were correlated with the lens transmittance of blue LED light (464 nm). These results suggest that lenses of various colors, especially deep yellow lenses, may protect retinal photoreceptor cells from blue LED light in proportion to the transmittance for the wavelength of blue LED and the suppression of reactive oxygen species production and cell damage.",Excluded

TRH deficiency leads to abnormal glycosylation of TSH alpha and beta subunits and loss of the normal circadian pattern of TSH secretion (low in the afternoon, a surge in the evening, higher at night). This disruption results in either mixed hypothyroidism (raised TSH with abnormal secretory kinetics) or central hypothyroidism (abnormal secretory kinetics without raised TSH). Although primary hypothyroidism is more common in the general population and cancer survivors, the cumulative incidence of central and mixed hypothyroidism is high during the ten years after cranial irradiation. Monitoring for decline in free thyroxine (FT(4)) and rise in serum TSH, and early recognition using TSH surge and TRH tests, are clinically valuable. Early thyroid hormone replacement therapy to achieve serum FT(4) in the upper half of the normal range is crucial for maintaining optimal health and growth in cancer survivors.

Of these, 143 underwent LD-CT with IR and 117 underwent ULD-CT with IR. The patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI) into BMI1 (<22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), BMI2 (23.0-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and BMI3 (>=25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) groups. Two blinded radiologists independently evaluated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), qualitative image quality, and final diagnoses (lumbar disc disease and facet joint osteoarthritis). L-spine MRIs interpreted by consensus were used as the reference standard. All data were statistically analyzed.RESULTS: ULD protocol showed significantly lower SNR for all patients (p < 0.001) except the vertebral bodies and lower qualitative image quality for BMI3 patients (p <= 0.033). There was no statistically significant difference between ULD (sensitivity, 95.1-98.1%; specificity, 92.5-98.7%; accuracy, 94.6-98.0%) and LD protocols (sensitivity, 95.6-100%; specificity, 95.5-98.9%; accuracy, 97.4-98.1%), (all p>=0.1) in the BMI1 and BMI2; while dose was 60-68% lower with the ULD protocol. Interobserver agreements were excellent or good with regard to image quality and final diagnoses.CONCLUSIONS: For the BM1 and BMI2 groups, ULD-CT provided an acceptable image quality and exhibited a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of LD-CT.

Experimental results are presented which describe induction and pathogenesis of the hydro-micrencephaly in NMRI-mice after single X-irradiation with 0.9 Gy or 1.9 Gy on gestation day (gd) 12. The ultrastructural alterations in the ventricular walls are sequentially investigated up to gross developmental damage. The ventricular zone is the most sensitive region in the developing brain. Its constituting undifferentiated and proliferating cells lose their palisade like orientation and fail subsequently to differentiate into primitive neurons, glia cells, or ependymal cells. Structurally this results in the thinning of ventricular walls by more than 50% associated with periventricular oedema and a dilation of the brain ventricles by 20-60%. Damage is clearly more pronounced with the higher dose. Repair processes originate from regions with intact Zonulae adherents which give also rise to typical globular or cylindrical heterotopic structures; these are known as rosettes and made up from undifferentiated proliferating ventricular cells. Perinatally in these rosettes cell replication persists, at a time when cell production in the ventricular zone has ceased. Histological changes are most prominent in and around the telencephalic roof consisting in replacement of the ependymal lining by a felt of glial fibers, faulty myelinisation, and periventricular oedema; postnatally these structural alterations lead to hydro-micrencephaly.

We aimed to confirm the photic and circadian responsiveness of its close relative-the Mozambique tilapia O. mossambicus. Melatonin production in cannulated or ophthalmectomized fish and its secretion from cultured pineal glands were examined under several light regimes. Melatonin production in the cannulated tilapias was measured at 3-h intervals; it fluctuated daily, with a nocturnal increase and a diurnal decrease. Exposing the cannulated fish to several light intensities (1500-0.1 lx) and to natural light (0.1 and 0.3 lx) suppressed melatonin levels within 30 min. Static pineal gland culture under light-dark and reverse light-dark cycles revealed that melatonin synthesis increased during the dark periods. Rhythmic melatonin synthesis disappeared on pineal gland culture under constant dark and light conditions. After ophthalmectomy, plasma melatonin levels did not vary with light-dark cycles. These results suggest that (1) Mozambique tilapias possess strong photic responsiveness, (2) their pineal glands are sensitive to light but lack circadian pacemaker activity, and (3) they require lateral eyes for rhythmic melatonin secretion from the pineal gland.",Excluded

Ganglioside lipids are abundant in neuronal membranes and have been found to accelerate fibril formation [1] and to accumulate in PD brains. We address the effects of ganglioside-phospholipid (GM3-POPC) model membranes on the dynamics (regarding the order parameter and the correlation time of C-H bond reorientation) and structure of co-aggregates with alpha-synuclein using polarization-transfer 13C solid-state NMR [2], wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and cryogenic electron microscopy. 31P NMR powder patterns were recorded to monitor the lipid phase behavior and the spinning sidebands at 1250 Hz MAS were used to fit the chemical shift anisotropy before and after coaggregation. It was found that both lipids are co-assembled with alpha-synuclein with reduced headgroup and acyl chain mobility, and that the mobility of alpha-synuclein is modulated by the lipid-to-protein ratio and membrane composition. As the ganglioside content of membranes was increased the mobility of alanine residues is affected, implying a modulation of the fibril core which could impact the fibrillation propensity. These effects of co-aggregation on alpha-synuclein fibril mobility are currently being further investigated by us and raises questions on the specific lipid-protein interactions and the organization of lipids inside coaggregates.",Excluded

These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts. We conclude that broadly distributed, adult pluripotent stem cells underlie the remarkable regenerative abilities of planarians.",Excluded
2199,"Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish. Larval zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating the mechanisms involved in generating rhythmic patterns of behavior, such as swimming, due to the array of techniques available including genetics, optical imaging, and conventional electrophysiology. Because electrophysiological and imaging studies of rhythmic motor behaviors in paralyzed preparations depend on the ability to monitor the central motor pattern, we developed a fictive preparation in which the activity of axial motor neurons was monitored using extracellular recordings from peripheral nerves. We examined spontaneous and light induced fictive motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish (4-6 days post-fertilization) paralyzed with curare. All spontaneous and light-induced preparations produced alternation of motor activity from side-to-side (mean contralateral phase = 50.7 +/- 7.0%; mean burst frequency = 35.6 +/- 4.7 Hz) and a progression of activity from head-to-tail (mean ipsilateral rostrocaudal delay = 0.8 +/- 0.5 ms per segment), consistent with lateral undulation and forward propulsion during swimming, respectively. The basic properties of the motor pattern were similar in spontaneous and light-induced swimming. This fictive preparation can be used in combination with conventional electrophysiological and imaging methods to investigate normal circuit function as well as to elucidate functional deficits in mutant lines. Toward this end, we show that two accordion class mutants, accordion and bandoneon, have alternating activity on opposite sides of the body, contradicting the hypothesis that their deficit results from the absence of the reciprocal glycinergic inhibition that is typically found in the spinal cord of swimming vertebrates.",Excluded
1740,"Evaluation of reduced-dose CT for acute non-traumatic abdominal pain: evaluation of diagnostic accuracy in comparison to standard-dose CT. Background Patients with acute non-traumatic abdominal pain often undergo abdominal computed tomography (CT). However, abdominal CT is associated with high radiation exposure. Purpose To evaluate diagnostic performance of a reduced-dose 100 kVp CT protocol with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction as compared to a linearly blended 120 kVp protocol for assessment of acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain. Material and Methods Two radiologists assessed 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series of 112 consecutive patients with acute non-traumatic pain (onset < 48 h) regarding image quality, noise, and artifacts on a five-point Likert scale. Both radiologists assessed both series for abdominal pathologies and for diagnostic confidence. Both 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series were quantitatively evaluated regarding radiation dose and image noise. Comparative statistics and diagnostic accuracy was calculated using receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics, with final clinical diagnosis/clinical follow-up as reference standard. Results Image quality was high for both series without detectable significant differences ( P = 0.157). Image noise and artifacts were rated low for both series but significantly higher for 100 kVp ( P <= 0.021). Diagnostic accuracy was high for both series (120 kVp: area under the curve [AUC] = 0.950, sensitivity = 0.958, specificity = 0.941; 100 kVp: AUC >= 0.910, sensitivity >= 0.937, specificity = 0.882; P >= 0.516) with almost perfect inter-rater agreement (Kappa = 0.939). Diagnostic confidence was high for both dose levels without significant differences (100 kVp 5, range 4-5; 120 kVp 5, range 3-5; P = 0.134). The 100 kVp series yielded 26.1% lower radiation dose compared with the 120 kVp series (5.72 +/- 2.23 mSv versus 7.75 +/- 3.02 mSv, P < 0.001). Image noise was significantly higher in reduced-dose CT (13.3 +/- 2.4 HU versus 10.6 +/- 2.1 HU; P < 0.001). Conclusion Reduced-dose abdominal CT using 100 kVp yields excellent image quality and high diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of acute non-traumatic abdominal pain.",Excluded
620,"Potential role for LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of 5 or more radioresistant melanoma brain metastases. OBJECT: Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for patients with melanoma in whom brain metastases have developed. Very limited data are available on treating patients with >=5 lesions. The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of SRS in patients with >=5 melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma treated with SRS in a single treatment session for >=5 lesions was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were reviewed post-SRS to evaluate local control (LC). Disease progression on imaging was defined using the 2009 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Survival curves were calculated from the date of brain metastases diagnosis or the date of SRS by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate and multivariate analysis (UVA and MVA, respectively) were performed using the Cox proportional-hazards model.RESULTS: The authors identified 149 metastatic brain lesions treated in 28 patients. The median patient age was 60.5 years (range 38-83 years), and the majority of patients (24 [85.7%]) had extracranial metastases. Four patients (14.3%) had received previous whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and 11 (39.3%) had undergone previous SRS. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 0.34 cm3 (range 0.01-12.5 cm3). Median follow-up was 6.3 months (range 1-46 months). At the time of treatment, 7% of patients were categorized as recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I, 89% as RPA Class II, and 4% as RPA Class III. The rate of local failure was 11.4%. Kaplan-Meier LC estimates at 6 and 12 months were 91.3% and 82.2%, respectively. A PTV volume>=0.34 cm3 was a significant predictor of local failure on UVA (HR 16.1, 95% CI 3.2-292.6, p<0.0001) and MVA (HR 14.8, 95% CI 3.0-268.5, p=0.0002). Sixteen patients (57.1%) were noted to have distant failure in the brain with a median time to failure of 3 months (range 1-15 months). Nine patients with distant failures received WBRT, and 7 received additional SRS. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.4 and 7.6 months from the date of brain metastases diagnosis and the date of SRS, respectively. The KM OS estimates at 6 and 12 months were 57.8% and 28.2%, respectively, from the time of SRS treatment. The RPA class was a significant predictor of KM OS estimates from the date of treatment (p=0.02). Patients who did not receive WBRT after SRS treatment had decreased OS on MVA (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-12.0, p=0.03), and patients who did not receive WBRT prior to SRS had improved OS (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.53, p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery for >=5 lesions appears to be effective for selected patients with metastatic melanoma, offering excellent LC. This is particularly important for patients as new targeted systemic agents are improving outcomes but still have limited efficacy within the central nervous system.",Excluded
2977,"Effect of proton pump inhibitors in hospitalization on mortality of patients with hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis but no active gastrointestinal bleeding. BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric complication of decompensated cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), used as potent acid suppressants, are associated with HE occurrence in cirrhotic patients. However, it is still unknown if PPIs contribute to mortality in cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastrointestinal bleeding.METHODS: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to identify 1004 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding, who received oral PPIs between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. On the basis of comorbid disorder data, we used propensity score matching at a 1:4 ratio to select 4016 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding who did not receive PPIs as a comparison group. All patients were followed up for one year from the index time.RESULTS: The overall 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were 36.1%, 52.6%, and 70.1% in PPI group, and 27.5%, 41.7%, and 62.4% in non-PPI group. Using Cox regression model analysis with adjustment for age, gender, and other comorbid disorders, we obtained hazard ratios of 1.360 (95% CI: 1.208-1.532, P<0.001), 1.563 (95% CI: 1.314-1.859; P<0.001), and 1.187 (95% CI: 1.008-1.398; P=0.040) for, respectively, 30-day, 30-day to 90-day, and 90-day to 1-year mortality in patients taking PPIs.CONCLUSION: PPIs increase short-term and long-term mortality of cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastrointestinal bleeding.",Excluded

In December 2006, the Radiation Research Program of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of the National Cancer Institute hosted a workshop intended to address current issues related to advanced radiation therapy technologies, with an eye toward (1) defining the specific toxicities that have limited the success of ""conventional"" radiation therapy, (2) examining the evidence from phase III studies for the improvements attributed to the advanced technologies in the treatment of several cancers commonly treated with radiation therapy, and (3) determining the opportunities and priorities for further technologic development and clinical trials. The new technologies offer substantial theoretical advantage in radiation dose distributions that, if realized in clinical practice, may help many cancer patients live longer and/or better. The precision of the advanced technologies may allow us to reduce the volume of normal tissue irradiated in the vicinity of the clinical target volume. Part 1 of this two-part article, which appeared in the March issue of ONCOLOGY, provided a general overview of the workshop discussion, focusing on the challenges posed by the new technologies and resources available or in development for meeting those challenges.

1294,"Targeting glioma stem cells with Car-T immunotherapy in xenograft animal models. Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors often arise from glioma-initiating cells or glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are usually resistant to the standard therapeutic regiment of radiation and chemotherapy and hence have been an attractive target for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies to treating recurrent GBMs. Chimeric antigen receptor expressing engineered T (CAR-T) cells are redirected to detect and destroy rare tumor cells that express specific tumor antigens. CAR-T cells have been successful in treating hematological cancers, and moderately effective in remission of primary GBM tumors, but not yet been successful in the immunotherapeutic targeting of GSCs or recurrent GBMs. In this study, we have treated two patient-derived GSCs and tumor cell line derived neurospheres, as well as GSC/neurosphere-derived secondary tumor cells with CAR-T cells that specifically target IL13Ralpha2 tumor antigens on GBMs. These GSCs and neurospheres were resistant to radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy but were successful in activating antigen-specific CAR-T cells- as observed by increased proliferation as well as secretion of cytokines. In vitro co-culture of CAR-T cells with GSCs, neurospheres, and secondary tumors resulted in the effective cytotoxic killing of tumor cells. In experimental animals bearing xenograft implantation of GSCs or redefined secondary tumor cells, tumors went into remission when treated with CAR-T cells, in comparison to treatment with T cells that did not express specific CAR molecule. Together, we conclude that CAR-T cell immunotherapy can be an effective approach to targeting GSCs and treating secondary or recurrent GBM tumors.",Excluded

1880,"Radiosensitivity and differentiation of ganglion cells within fetal mouse retinal explants in vitro. Fetal mouse retinas were explanted at 13-14 days of gestation, and exposed to gamma radiation in vitro. Not all regions of the retina were equally susceptible to radiation-induced necrosis; when exposed to 5000 rads soon after explanation, each explant had a single small radioresistant nubbin of apparently intact tissue, located near the optic nerve-head. This region of radioresistant tissue was larger when the dose of radiation was reduced and when the explants were exposed at later times in vitro, indicating the existence of a gradient of radioresistance across retinal explants which spread outward through at least the first week in vitro, the period examined. Based upon the extensive in situ literature which has correlated the emergence of radioresistance with the differentiation of retinal neurons, we conclude that the in situ central-to-peripheral sequence of cellular differentiation continues in vitro within our retinal explants. Whereas the ganglion cell axonal outgrowth from control retinas grown in isolation on collagen substrates underwent a gradual disintegration over 3 weeks in vitro, the sparse axonal outgrowth from explants exposed to 5000 rads disintegrated abruptly at 5-7 days in vitro. This did not appear to be due to direct damage from radiation, but instead reflected the fact that axons in irradiated cultures arose from central retinal regions only, while many axons in control cultures emerged from later-differentiating peripheral regions. We suggest that disintegration of individual axons in the outgrowth may occur rapidly and in a central-to-peripheral sequence. These findings should be useful in designing assays for trophic factors which may prevent ganglion cell axon disintegration in this in vitro model system.",Excluded

Our ocular transmission photometric measurements revealed that the distribution of light intensity across the rat retina was not as simple as had been thought and, furthermore, that the local concentration of rhodopsin had a high negative correlation with the light intensity. 3. The reciprocity between these two parameters leads to nearly uniform rates of photon absorption in rods across the retina.",Excluded
1894,"Intra-operative radiation therapy for malignant brain tumours: Rationale, method, and treatment results of cerebral glioblastomas. In radiation therapy for malignant brain tumours, the dose of radiation that can be safely delivered to a tumour is limited by the radiation tolerance of the adjacent normal brain tissue. Among various radiation modalities to produce local tumour eradication without unacceptable complications, we chose a large, single irradiation dose during the operation (intra-operative radiation therapy, IORT). In contrast to X-ray or Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiation, IORT with a high-energy electron beam delivered by the Shimadzu 20MeV betatron provides acceptable dose homogeneity with rapid fall-off of the radiation dose beyond the treatment volume. Thus, IORT has the advantage of precise demarcation of the target volume, minimum damage to surrounding normal tissues, and a high absorbed target dose (15-25Gy in 5-10min). On the basis of our experience with 170 patients treated by IORT, we established the treatment indications and method in patients with malignant brain tumours. IORT with a dose of 15-25 Gy was delivered to widely resected tumours followed by external radiation therapy. No acute or subacute complications were observed. Treatment results of 30 patients with glioblastoma treated by IORT (mean 18.3 Gy) combined with external radiation therapy (mean 58.5 Gy) resulted in a median survival of 119 weeks and a 2-year survival rate of 61%.",Excluded

Sympathomimetic agents are frequent components in antimotion-sickness drug combinations because of their usefulness in counteracting the sedation caused by stressful motion or resulting from the administration of other antimotion-sickness drugs. The noradrenergic neurochemistry of the brain's arousal-attentional systems prompted us to evaluate the efficacy of five new sympathomimetic drugs and to further define the role of arousal in susceptibility to motion. Subjects were orally administered methamphetamine (20 mg), phenmetrazine (25 mg), phentermine (37.5 mg), methylphenidate (20 mg), or pemoline (75 mg) 2 h prior to taking a Staircase Profile Test. All of the drugs increased resistance to stressful coriolis stimulation by 80-120%. Methylphenidate and pemoline showed fewer side effects. These findings, interpreted in conjunction with the documented inefficacy of most anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs tested to date, suggest that sympathomimetic drugs or a generalized state of arousal can inhibit the development of motion sickness.",Excluded
1345,"Genetic and firefly metaheuristic algorithms for an optimized neuro-fuzzy prediction modeling of wildfire probability. In the terrestrial ecosystems, perennial challenges of increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are exacerbated by climate change and unplanned human activities. Development of robust management and suppression plans requires accurate estimates of future burn probabilities. This study describes the development and validation of two hybrid intelligence predictive models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA), for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.92; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.89; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.82; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolkits to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies.

927,"Targeting MYCN IRES in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma with miR-375 inhibits tumor growth and sensitizes tumor cells to radiation. The MYCN oncogene is amplified in 20% of neuroblastomas, leading to its overexpression at both the mRNA and protein levels. MYCN overexpression is strongly associated with advanced disease stage, rapid tumor progression and a worse prognosis. In the present study, we identified microRNA-375 (miR-375) as a negative regulator of MYCN: enforced expression of miR-375 inhibited MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Upon searching the website miRbase for possible miR-375 binding sites within the whole MYCN mRNA, we found that the MYCN 5'-UTR had significant sequence complementarity to miR-375, yet no complementary sequences existed within the MYCN 3'-UTR and coding regions. Enforced overexpression of miR-375 efficiently inhibited MYCN mRNA translation and protein synthesis, via an IRES-dependent mechanism. In athymic nude mouse model with human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, MYCN downregulation by miR-375 led to inhibition of tumor cell growth and tumorigenicity. In particular, miR-375-regulated inhibition of MYCN translation was enhanced when MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells were exposed to stress stimulation, such as ionizing irradiation (IR), resulting in a remarkable increase in the neuroblastoma's sensitivity to IR-induced cell death. Our results identified a novel mechanism by which IRES-dependent translation of MYCN is repressed by miR-375, particularly during cellular stress, highlighting a potential anticancer strategy: the development of miR-375 as a novel therapeutic agent to treat MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.",Excluded
674,"Precision dosimetry for narrow photon beams used in radiosurgery-determination of Gamma Knife output factors. Treatment units for radiosurgery, like Leksell Gamma Knife and adapted, or dedicated, linear accelerators use small circular beams of ionizing radiation down to 4 mm in diameter at the isocenter. By cross-firing, these beams generate a high dose region at the isocenter together with steep dose gradients of up to 30% per mm. These units are used to treat small complex shaped lesions, often located close to critical structures within the brain, by superimposing several single high dose regions. In order to commission such treatment units for stereotactic irradiations, to carry out quality assurance and to simulate treatment conditions, as well as to collect input data for treatment planning, a precise dosimetric system is necessary. Commercially available radiation dosimeters only partially meet the requirements for narrow photon beams and small field sizes as used in stereotactic treatment modalities.

Light exposure elicits numerous effects on human physiology and behavior, such as better cognitive performance and mood. Here we investigated the role of morning light exposure as a countermeasure for impaired cognitive performance and mood under sleep restriction (SR). Seventeen participants took part of a 48h laboratory protocol, during which three different light settings (separated by 2 wks) were administered each morning after two 6-h sleep restriction nights: a blue monochromatic LED (light-emitting diode) light condition (BL; 100 lux at 470 nm for 20 min) starting 2 h after scheduled wake-up time, a dawn-simulating light (DsL) starting 30 min before and ending 20 min after scheduled wake-up time (polychromatic light gradually increasing from 0 to 250 lux), and a dim light (DL) condition for 2 h beginning upon scheduled wake time (<8 lux). Cognitive tasks were performed every 2 h during scheduled wakefulness, and questionnaires were administered hourly to assess subjective sleepiness, mood, and well-being. Salivary melatonin and cortisol were collected throughout scheduled wakefulness in regular intervals, and the effects on melatonin were measured after only one light pulse. Following the first SR, analysis of the time course of cognitive performance during scheduled wakefulness indicated a decrease following DL, whereas it remained stable following BL and significantly improved after DsL. Cognitive performance levels during the second day after SR were not significantly affected by the different light conditions. However, after both SR nights, mood and well-being were significantly enhanced after exposure to morning DsL compared with DL and BL. Melatonin onset occurred earlier after morning BL exposure, than after morning DsL and DL, whereas salivary cortisol levels were higher at wake-up time after DsL compared with BL and DL. Our data indicate that exposure to an artificial morning dawn simulation light improves subjective well-being, mood, and cognitive performance, as compared with DL and BL, with minimal impact on circadian phase. Thus, DsL may provide an effective strategy for enhancing cognitive performance, well-being, and mood under mild sleep restriction.",Excluded

Aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility of radioguided surgical nodal staging using <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC(TEKTROTYD) in GEP-NETs. Subjects and methods: Patients with histologically proven GEP-NET eligible to radical or palliative surgery showing avid tumor uptake on <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy and SPECT/CT were prospectively enrolled. Approximately 4h before surgery, 185 MBq of <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC were i.v. administered. Intraoperative localization of primary tumor and radioactive lymph nodes was performed using a hand-held gamma-probe set on <sup>99M</sup>Tc energy peak. Radioactive lymph nodes were localized and excised before proceeding to regional lymphadenectomy. Extra-regional lymphatic basins were also investigated. Resected specimens were re-evaluated ex vivo with the gamma-probe after macroscopic lymph node isolation. Result(s): Since February 2017, fve GEP-NET patients were enrolled (3 pts had G1-G2 ileal NET, 1 pt G2 rectal NET and 1 pt gastric NEC). All primary lesions seen on pre-operative scin-tigraphy were successfully localized with gamma-probe and completely excised. Mean in-vivo tumor count-rate was 399 counts-per-second/cps (range 80-496). Histological examination confrmed pre-operative diagnosis in all cases. A total of 107 lymph nodes was resected (mean number per patient 21, range 14-40), including 35 radioactive lymph nodes (mean number 7, range 3-12). Mean in-vivo nodal count-rate was 185 cps (range 14-722). 20/35 radioactive lymph nodes were meta-static at histologic examination (mean number 4, range 1-11). No metastatic involvement of ""cold"" lymph nodes was reported. Notably, ex-vivo count-rate of metastatic lymph nodes showed no significant variation from in-vivo gamma-probe evaluation, whereas non-involved nodes showed generally a sharp decrease in ex-vivo count-rate. In one patient, radioguided nodal evaluation determined the localization of a metastatic node in a extra-regional district. Median follow-up after surgery was 11 months (range 5-13). Clinical and instrumental follow-up evaluation showed stable disease in every patient, with no evidence of nodal disease recurrence.

1074,"Radiotherapy in older patients with GBM. The incidence of glioblastoma in the elderly population has increased over the last few decades. Current treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy, but the optimal management of disease remains a matter of debate. RT remains an effective treatment in elderly patients with GBM and either standard RT or hypofractionated RT are associated with longer survival than supportive care only. Randomized studies comparing standard RT versus hypofractionated radiation schedules show similar survival benefits, although short-courses RT are associated with a better safety profile. Hypofractionated RT should be chosen in older patients with newly diagnosed GBM, especially in those with poor performance status or older than 70 years old. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a safe and effective treatment option alternative to RT. Recent randomized studies indicates that chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide is a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients of 60 years or older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Decisions regarding the choice between RT and TMZ chemotherapy should be based on the assessment of O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter gene. Patients with MGMT methylated tumors receive the most significant survival benefit from treatment with TMZ; by contrast, chemotherapy produces no benefit in patients with MGMT unmethylated tumors, suggesting that RT is a better option in these patients. Few studies have reported survival benefit in elderly patients treated with a combination of standard RT with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ. Although this may represent a feasible therapeutic approach in selected patients of 60-70 years old with good performance status, the potential toxicity of standard RT and chemotherapy for large irradiated brain volumes, and the modest survival advantages in this age group as compared with younger patients, do not support the use of aggressive treatments in the majority of elderly patients. An abbreviated course of RT plus TMZ may represent a feasible treatment associated with similar survival benefit and improved quality of life. Results from an EORTC large randomized study comparing a short course of RT (40 Gy in 15 daily fractions) with or without concomitant and adjuvant TMZ in elderly patients older than 65 years old with newly diagnosed GBM indicate that RT+TMZ is a safe and effective treatment in older GBM patients. Currently, several questions regarding the risks and benefit of combined chemoradiation remains unanswered.",Excluded

1357,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a patient receiving anticonvulsant therapy during cranial irradiation. A 28-year-old female patient with a recent history of breast carcinoma was referred to our clinic with generalized necrotic skin eruptions and severe mucosal erosions, which developed right after the completion of cranial radiotherapy for brain metastases. She had been receiving prophylactic diphenylhydantoin treatment 100 mg three times daily during radiation therapy. The extensive involvement of the oral mucosa with conjunctivitis and synechiae of the eyelids, facial swelling, and extension of the rash over the trunk and shoulders with bullous detachment of less than 10% of the total body surface strongly suggested Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by phenytoin treatment in our patient. There has been conflicting evidence on the role of radiotherapy in the increased risk of severe drug reactions. Although various authors have emphasized the augmented rate of severe mucocutaneous reactions caused by anticonvulsants given during radiotherapy and suggested discontinuing the prophylactic use of such drugs in patients with no history of seizures, others have argued in favor of prophylactic anticonvulsants. Given the high risk of seizures, reaching 20% in patients with brain tumors, and the low incidence of drug reactions, the suggestion of refraining from prophylactic anticonvulsants in the setting of primary or metastatic brain tumors is controversial.",Excluded
382,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: a planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).METHODS: Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.RESULTS: The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p < 0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p < 0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.",Excluded
2434,"Seizure suppression by EEG-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat. OBJECTIVE: To test the anticonvulsive potential of a range of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies by novel methods for simultaneous EEG and rTMS in a rat seizure model.METHODS: Seizures were triggered by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA; 10mg/kg). Rats (n=21) were divided into three groups in which individual seizures were treated with rTMS trains at one of three frequencies: 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 Hz. EEG was continuously viewed by an operator who identified each seizure onset. Consecutive seizures in each animal were (1) treated with active rTMS, (2) treated with sham rTMS, or (3) were untreated. EEG was re-analyzed post hoc by visual inspection, and seizure durations were compared within and between treatment groups.RESULTS: KA-induced seizures were abbreviated by 0.75 Hz (P=0.019) and 0.5 Hz (P=0.033) active EEG-guided rTMS. In contrast, neither active 0.25 Hz rTMS nor the control conditions affected seizure duration (P>0.2).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that EEG-guided rTMS can suppress seizures in the rat KA epilepsy model, and that the effect is frequency dependent, with 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS being superior to 0.25 Hz rTMS.SIGNIFICANCE: These data support the use of rat seizure models in translational research aimed at evaluation and development of effective rTMS anticonvulsive protocols. We also offer a proof of principle that real-time analysis of EEG can be used to guide rTMS to suppress individual seizures.",Excluded
2136,"Deliberate practice in medical sciences education. The role of deliberate practice (DP) theory in the development of skill has been widely studied. Emerging evidence in the healthcare literature shows the potential role of DP theory-driven approaches to skill acquisition in educational settings. While it has been extensively reviewed in other health professions, there is a lack of empirical evidence of its value within the medical radiation science (MRS) professions. Professional capabilities and accreditation standards highlight the minimum level of competence for graduates to safely practise the profession. Many of these defined competencies and standards involve observable complex psychomotor and cognitive skills. In this paper, the authors review the concept of deliberate practice, clarify the guiding principles and offer some examples of successful DP implementations within educational contexts. The authors draw on specific examples from the sonography and radiation therapy educational contexts and provide strategies for isolating and improving various domain-specific skills. While the concept of DP may appear relevant to the development of different MRS skills, a lack of development of evidence-based DP frameworks for MRS is evident. It will require extensive research and collaboration, with the primary aim of accelerating student and practitioner confidence, ultimately improving the quality of patient care and safety with the medical radiation practices.",Excluded

Background: Patients with malignant glioma are usually managed in neurosurgical tertiary referral centres, however 30% return to their regional/ rural location for ongoing care. This study explored levels of communication, education and the needs of patients and doctors. Method(s): A survey was designed, targeting regional/rural oncologists, general practitioners (GPs) and patients with malignant glioma. The survey was funded by a Western and Central Melbourne Integrated Cancer Service (WCMICS) grant. Questions to doctors included: adequacy of referral information, access to services and areas they would like to improve knowledge skills. Patient questions included: information provided at diagnosis, ability to access medical services and improved clinical support. Result(s): The overall response rate was 49% (8 oncologists, 30 GPs, 9 patients). 70% of GPs felt the information received from the hospital was 'adequate' or 'excellent'. Doctors sought: improved communication and support regarding clinical decision making (multi-disciplinary care), education regarding the use of dexamethasone, antiepileptics, novel therapies and recommendations regarding driving. 37% of GPs had 'low': confidence in managing patients with malignant gliomas. 78% of patients felt they were provided 'enough' information at diagnosis. The three most comprehensive information sources for patients were their surgeon, medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. 56% of patients requested improved carer support and 67% would seek initial assistance from their GP for any issue related to their brain tumour. Conclusion(s): While communication between the tertiary hospital and regional/rural centres is occurring consistently, we have identified a number of areas where clinical care can be improved. An action plan is being developed to address educational needs for regional/rural doctors, and additional information provision for patients and their carers.",Excluded

3460,"Genetic and physiological regulation of non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells. Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. To investigate the process in NHEJ, we have established an in vitro system to clarify the measurement and analysis of the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining of DSBs, and applied the method to investigate NHEJ in human cells derived from patients suffering from cancer-prone hereditary diseases. A DSB was introduced in plasmid pZErO-2 at a specific site within the ccdB gene that is lethal to E. coli cells, and treated with nuclear extracts from human cells. The efficiency of rejoining in the nuclear extract from an A-T cell line was comparable to that from a control cell line. However, the accuracy of rejoining was much lower for the A-T cell extract than for the control cell extract. All mutations were deletions, most of which contained short direct repeats at the breakpoint junctions. The deletion spectrum caused by the A-T nuclear extract was distinct from that by the control extract. These results indicate that A-T cells have certain deficiencies in end-joining of double-strand breaks in DNA. The extract from BS cells also showed the similar activity and the lower fidelity of rejoing compared to that from normal cells. From the sequencing analysis of the junction of DSBs, it is speculated that the defect in the BLM helicase might cause irregular rejoining of DSBs. Radioadaptive response is the acquirement of cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by prior exposure to low dose. We investigated the in vitro end-joining activity of DNA ends in radioadaptive cells. Both the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining in the cells pre-exposed to low dose are increased comparing to those without pre-exposure. We also investigated the joining activity of DNA ends in p53-deficient cells. Pre-irradiation caused no apparent alteration in both the efficiency and fidelity of end-joining. These results suggest that the exposure to low dose activates a cellular function to repair DSBs efficiently, which is dependent on p53. These results indicate that NHEJ pathway is regulated by many factors; genetic regulation by ATM and BLM, and physiological conditions such as irradiation with ionizing radiation. The observations also suggest that in some occasions p53 might play a key role in NHEJ. [References: 103]",Excluded

Recent studies have suggested that regeneration of non-haematopoietic cell lineages can occur through heterotypic cell fusion with haematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. Here we show that lymphocytes also form heterotypic-fusion hybrids with cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, hepatocytes and Purkinje neurons. However, through lineage fate-mapping we demonstrate that such in vivo fusion of lymphoid and myeloid blood cells does not occur to an appreciable extent in steady-state adult tissues or during normal development. Rather, fusion of blood cells with different non-haematopoietic cell types is induced by organ-specific injuries or whole-body irradiation, which has been used in previous studies to condition recipients of bone marrow transplants. Our findings demonstrate that blood cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages contribute to various non-haematopoietic tissues by forming rare fusion hybrids, but almost exclusively in response to injuries or inflammation.",Excluded
2354,"Diffusion measured white matter disintegration in cluster headache. Objectives: In our former study we showed altered microstructure of the white matter in migraineurs. It is not known yet if these changes of MRI diffusion parameters were specific for migraine, or related to the repeated pain attacks. Method(s): 11 patients with cluster headache and 11 agematched healthy control subjects were recruited. Diffusion weighted MRI images with 60 diffusion directions were acquired on a 1.5 T GE Signa Excite scanner. Tract based spatial statistics were used to detect the integrity of white matter tracts in a skeleton representing the core of the fibre bundles. Result(s): Reduced fractional anisotropy was found in a right corticospinal tract, in the corpus callosum and in the anterior thalamic radiation bilaterally. The axial diffusivity was bilaterally increased in the anterior thalamic radiation, in the anterior corona radiate and in the inferior part of the fronto-occipital fasciculus. The mean and perpendicular diffusivity was increased almost over the whole brain with left sided dominance. Discussion(s): Since the above described white matter microstructural alterations, however more extensive, are similar to those found in migraine, this points to the assumption that these findings might reflect pain related alterations that are not specific to either of the diseases.",Excluded
1743,"A new UV-sensitive mutant that suggests a second excision repair pathway in Neurospora crassa. In an attempt to understand the relationship between photorepair and dark repair in Neurospora crassa, a new mutant was isolated, which showed defects in both repair processes. The new mutant, mus-38, is moderately sensitive to UV and shows imperfect photoreactivation following UV irradiation. DNA was purified from this mutant and the other UV-sensitive mutants, and analyzed for the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). UV-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites (ESS) completely disappeared with 1 h of photoreactivation in mus-38 DNA, although the survival recovery with photoreactivation was greatly reduced in this mutant. This suggests that the insufficient survival recovery with photoreactivation in mus-38 does not result from a failure of photo-reversal of CPDs. Removal of ESS during liquid holding (dark repair) was slower in mus-38 compared to wild type. To test the possibility that this mutant was involved in excision repair, the double mutant was made between mus-38 and mus-18, which encodes a UV-damage-specific endonuclease. CPD excision in the mus-18 null mutant was severely affected but not completely inhibited. The double mutant showed a complete loss of the excision activity and was super sensitive to UV. These results indicate that mus-38 participates in an excision pathway that is different from the mus-18 pathway. The mus-38 mutant was sensitive not only to UV but also to some chemical mutagens which make adducts on DNA. Thus, mus-38 is possibly involved in an excision-repair pathway that is related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 pathway. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
2079,"Targeting the NF-E2-related factor 2 pathway: A novel strategy for glioblastoma (Review). Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant subtype among all brain tumors. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an essential component of cellular defense against a variety of endogenous and exogenous stresses. A marked increase in research over the past few decades focusing on Nrf2 and its role in regulating glioblastoma has revealed the potential value of Nrf2 in the treatment of glioblastoma. In the present review, we discuss a novel framework of Nrf2 in the regulation of glioblastoma and the mechanisms regarding the downregulation of Nrf2 in treating glioblastoma. The candidate mechanisms include direct and indirect means. Direct mechanisms target tumor molecular pathways in order to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to inhibit proliferation, to block invasion and migration, to induce apoptosis, to promote differentiation, to enhance autophagy and to target glioblastoma stem cells. Indirect mechanisms target the reaction between glioblastoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, the value of the Nrf2 pathway in glioblastoma provides a promising opportunity for new approaches by which to treat glioblastoma.",Excluded
1350,"Repeated cocaine administration increases voltage-sensitive calcium currents in response to membrane depolarization in medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in cocaine addiction. However, evidence to elucidate how the mPFC is functionally involved in cocaine addiction remains incomplete. Recent studies have revealed that repeated cocaine administration induces various neuroadaptations in pyramidal mPFC neurons, including a reduction in voltage-gated K+ currents (VGKCs) and a possible increase in voltage-sensitive Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)). Here, we performed both current-clamp recordings in brain slices and voltage-clamp recordings in freshly dissociated cells to determine whether I(Ca) is altered in mPFC pyramidal neurons after chronic cocaine treatment with a short-term or long-term withdrawal. In addition, a critical role of VGKCs in regulating the generation of Ca2+ plateau potential was also studied in mPFC neurons. Repeated cocaine administration significantly prolonged the duration of evoked Ca2+ plateau potentials and increased the whole-cell I(Ca) in mPFC neurons after a 3 d withdrawal. Selective blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine not only significantly increased the threshold but also reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca2+ plateau potentials in both saline- and cocaine-withdrawn mPFC neurons. However, there was no significant difference in the increased threshold, reduced duration, and decreased amplitude of Ca2+ potentials between saline- and cocaine-withdrawn neurons after blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels. Moreover, an increase in amplitude was also observed, whereas the prolonged duration persisted, in Ca2+ potentials after 2-3 weeks of withdrawal. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to cocaine facilitates the responsiveness of I(Ca), particularly via the activated L-type Ca2+ channels, to excitatory stimuli in rat mPFC pyramidal neurons.",Excluded
72,"Isolated Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the infundibulum presenting with fulminant diabetes insipidus. Introduction: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (histiocytosis X) is a rare disorder that can manifest with solitary bony lesions or disseminated disease in various tissues. A common manifestation of the disease is diabetes insipidus even in the absence of neural involvement. Disseminated disease often involves the central nervous system, but only six isolated lesions in the infundibulum have been reported. Case report: An 18-year-old male had failed to develop secondary sexual characteristics. He also had diabetes insipidus for more than 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 1-cm homogeneously enhancing mass in the region of the infundibulum. No other lesions were found in other organ systems. The patient underwent an orbitozygomatic osteotomy and pterional craniotomy. The lesion, which was adherent to the infundibulum, was partially resected. Microscopic analysis showed multiple lymphocytes and eosinophils with Langerhans cells that stained positive for S-100. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was diagnosed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 with no neurological deficits. His diabetes insipidus persisted, and he underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy to the sellar region. Conclusion(s): Isolated Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the infundibulum is rare. The usual presentation is hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and diabetes insipidus. Patients with diabetes insipidus of unknown origin should undergo MRI of the sellar region to rule out infundibular abnormalities. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",Excluded

Giant synapses between layer 5B (L5B) neurons of somatosensory (barrel) cortex and neurons of the posteromedial nucleus (POm) of thalamus reside in a key position of the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop, yet their synaptic properties and contribution to CTC information processing remain poorly understood. Fluorescence-guided local stimulation of terminals were combined with postsynaptic whole-cell recordings in thalamus to study synaptic transmission at an identified giant synapse. We found large EPSCs mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors. A single presynaptic electrical stimulus evoked a train of postsynaptic action potentials, indicating that a single L5B input can effectively drive the thalamic neuron. Repetitive stimulation caused strong short-term depression (STD) with fast recovery. To examine how these synaptic properties affect information transfer, spontaneous and evoked activity of L5B neurons was recorded in vivo and played back to giant terminals in vitro. We found that suprathreshold synaptic transmission was suppressed because of spontaneous activity causing strong STD of the L5B-POm giant synapse. Thalamic neurons only spiked after intervals of presynaptic silence or when costimulating two giant terminals. Therefore, STD caused by spontaneous activity of L5B neurons can switch the synapse from a ""driver mode"" to a ""coincidence mode."" Mechanisms decreasing spontaneous activity in L5B neurons and inputs synchronized by a sensory stimulus may thus gate the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate hippocampal doses and target volume coverage with and without hippocampal sparing when treating multiple brain metastases using various stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) platforms.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We selected 10 consecutive patients with 14 separate treatments who had been treated in our department for 3 to 10 brain metastases and added hippocampal avoidance contours. All 14 treatments were planned with GammaPlan for Gamma Knife, Eclipse for single isocenter volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), TomoTherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS) for TomoTherapy, and MultiPlan for CyberKnife. Initial planning was performed with the goal of planning target volume coverage of V100 >=95% without hippocampal avoidance. If the maximum hippocampal point dose (Dmax) was <6.6 Gy in a single fraction and <40% of the hippocampi received <=4.5 Gy, no second plan was performed. If either constraint was not met, replanning was performed with these constraints.RESULTS: There was a median of 6 metastases per plan, with an average total tumor volume of 7.32 mL per plan. The median hippocampal Dmax (in Gy) without sparing averaged 1.65, 9.81, 4.38, and 5.46, respectively (P < .0001). Of 14 plans, 3 Gamma Knife and CyberKnife plans required replanning, whereas 13 VMAT and 8 TomoTherapy plans required replanning. The hippocampal constraints were not achievable in 1 plan on any platform when the tumor was bordering the hippocampus. The mean volume of brain receiving 12 Gy (in mL), which has been associated with symptomatic radionecrosis, was 23.57 with Gamma Knife, 76.77 with VMAT, 40.86 with CyberKnife, and 104.06 with TomoTherapy (P = .01). The overall average conformity indices for all plans ranged from 0.36 to 0.52.CONCLUSIONS: Even with SRS, the hippocampi can receive a considerable dose; however, if the hippocampi are outlined as organs of risk, sparing these structures is feasible in nearly all situations with all 4 platforms, without detriment to target coverage, and should be considered in all patients undergoing SRS for multiple brain metastases.SUMMARY: Hippocampi play an important role in memory, and sparing of these structures in whole brain radiation can improve neurocognitive outcomes. The hippocampi are not routinely spared when using stereotactic radiosurgery. We evaluated the incidental dose to the hippocampi when treating multiple brain metastases and sought to examine if hippocampal sparing is feasible without detriment to target coverage. We found that hippocampal sparing is possible without affecting coverage or conformality in most cases across treatment platforms.",Excluded

For intracranial lesions, however, early evidence suggests that focal radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy may achieve high local control rates and limit radiation toxicity. This study examines the efficacy of treatment approaches in the management of CNS germinoma patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Methods. Seventy-nine patients who received primary treatment for germinoma between 1980 and 2010 at UCSF were identified and their charts reviewed. Primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results. 29 patients were treated with XRT alone and 50 with XRT and chemotherapy. 22 patients received focal XRT, 32 received whole brain irradiation (WBI) and 9 received CSI. Field data was unrecoverable for 16 patients. 14 patients progressed and 8 died from disease. PFS rate at 5 years was 87.7% and OS rate at 5 years was 93.0%. Overall, focal XRT had significantly higher rates of disease progression compared to WBI or CSI (p - 0.047 and p - 0.008 respectively) and among patients who had solitary lesions, focal XRT and chemotherapy had significantly higher rates of disease progression (p - 0 .024) than WBI and chemotherapy. Conclusion. Among all CNS germinoma patients, CSI or WBI achieve better control rates than focal XRT. specifically for solitary intracranial lesions, WBI and chemotherapy is superior to focal XRT and chemotherapy as it is associated with significantly lower rates of progression.",Excluded

Here we demonstrate that a tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive persistent current also contributes to the graded depolarization. This current was isolated in amacrine cells of the goldfish retinal slice preparations by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The activation threshold of the persistent current was about -50 mV, approximately 10 mV more positive than the membrane potential in the dark.

1909,"Depleted and natural uranium: chemistry and toxicological effects. Depleted uranium (DU) is a by-product from the chemical enrichment of naturally occurring uranium. Natural uranium is comprised of three radioactive isotopes: (238)U, (235)U, and (234)U. This enrichment process reduces the radioactivity of DU to roughly 30% of that of natural uranium. Nonmilitary uses of DU include counterweights in airplanes, shields against radiation in medical radiotherapy units and transport of radioactive isotopes. DU has also been used during wartime in heavy tank armor, armor-piercing bullets, and missiles, due to its desirable chemical properties coupled with its decreased radioactivity. DU weapons are used unreservedly by the armed forces. Chemically and toxicologically, DU behaves similarly to natural uranium metal. Although the effects of DU on human health are not easily discerned, they may be produced by both its chemical and radiological properties. DU can be toxic to many bodily systems, as presented in this review. Most importantly, normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, and heart can be affected by DU exposure. Numerous other systems can also be affected by DU exposure, and these are also reviewed. Despite the prevalence of DU usage in many applications, limited data exist regarding the toxicological consequences on human health.

1057,"Role of immediate-release morphine (MIR) in the treatment of predictable pain in radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is crucial in the management of cancer patients in both the curative and palliative settings. However, patients often report pain both during positioning for, and execution of, radiotherapy and this may be a reason for interrupting the radiotherapy session. This observation is common even if the patient is undergoing baseline drug therapy for cancer pain. Recent data suggest that orally administrated immediate-release morphine (MIR) is able to reduce pain in patients with predictable pain. The authors tested a rescue dose of MIR 10 or 20 mg, 20 to 60 minutes before radiotherapy, to verify the effectiveness of MIR in this setting and also to assess the patient's ability to receive the full course of radiotherapy. One hundred forty consecutive patients were evaluated during radiotherapy treatment and visual analogue scale (VAS) and positioning VAS scores were assessed. All patients completed the course of scheduled radiotherapy and pain was well controlled, despite the fact that previous pharmacological treatment had not been able to completely control chronic cancer pain. These data strongly suggest a role for MIR pretreatment in patients with pain due to positioning during radiotherapy.",Excluded
488,"Atm knock-in mice harboring an in-frame deletion corresponding to the human ATM 7636del9 common mutation exhibit a variant phenotype. ATM, the gene mutated in the human immunodeficiency disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), plays a central role in recognizing ionizing radiation damage in DNA and in controlling several cell cycle checkpoints. We describe here a murine model in which a nine-nucleotide in-frame deletion has been introduced into the Atm gene by homologous recombination followed by removal of the selectable marker cassette by Cre-loxP site-specific, recombination-mediated excision. This mouse, Atm-DeltaSRI, was designed as a model of one of the most common deletion mutations (7636del9) found in A-T patients. The murine Atm deletion results in the loss of three amino acid residues (SRI; 2556-2558) but produces near full-length detectable Atm protein that lacks protein kinase activity. Radiosensitivity was observed in Atm-DeltaSRI mice, whereas the immunological profile of these mice showed greater heterogeneity of T-cell subsets than observed in Atm(-/-) mice. The life span of Atm-DeltaSRI mice was significantly longer than that of Atm(-/-) mice when maintained under nonspecific pathogen-free conditions. This can be accounted for by a lower incidence of thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice up to 40 weeks, after which time the animals died of other causes. The thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice were characterized by extensive apoptosis, which appears to be attributable to an increased number of cells expressing Fas ligand. A variety of other tumors including B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas not seen in Atm(-/-) mice were observed in older Atm-DeltaSRI animals. Thus, expression of mutant protein in Atm-DeltaSRI knock-in mice gives rise to a discernibly different phenotype to Atm(-/-) mice, which may account for the heterogeneity seen in A-T patients with different mutations.",Excluded

Analyses were performed for correlations between changes in 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET (metabolism), (15)O-PET (relative blood flow), regional radiation dose, follow-up time, and neuropsychological test scores.RESULTS: Eleven subjects were enrolled and 6 completed follow-up studies. The PET data showed reduced FDG uptake, with average decreases of 2-6% in regions of the brain receiving greater than 40 Gy at 3 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The (15)O-H(2)O PET showed increases (<10%) at 3 weeks in relative regional blood flow in brain receiving greater than 30 Gy, but less at the 6-month follow-up studies. There were significant correlations between decreases in FDG uptake and increased scores from the Symptom Checklist-90-R, with an average increase in T score of 2 (p < 0.0001). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed a significant correlation of decreased FDG uptake with increased errors and perseveration in test performance, with an average decrease in T score of 11 (p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent response of CNS tissue was detected using FDG PET in this small number of patients. Decreases in CNS metabolism correlated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests for problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and global measures of psychopathology. Additional research is needed to verify and define these findings.",Excluded
2415,"Radiation dose reduction using real-time image processing in interventional radiology. Purpose: To characterize changes in radiation dose after introducing a new real-time image processing technology in interventional radiology systems. Method(s): Interventional radiology (IR) procedures are increasingly complex, at times requiring substantial time and radiation dose. The risk of inducing tissue reactions as well as long-term stochastic effects such as radiation-induced cancer is not trivial. To reduce this risk, IR systems are increasingly equipped with dose reduction technologies. Recently, ClarityIQ (Philips Healthcare) technology was installed in our existing neuroradiology IR (NIR) and vascular IR (VIR) suites respectively. ClarityIQ includes realtime image processing that reduces noise/artifacts, enhances images, and sharpens edges while also reducing radiation dose rates. We reviewed 412 NIR (175 pre-and 237 post-ClarityIQ) procedures and 329 VIR (156 preand 173 post-ClarityIQ) procedures performed at our institution pre-and post-ClarityIQ implementation. NIR procedures were primarily classified as interventional or diagnostic. VIR procedures included drain port, drain placement, tube change, mesenteric, and implanted venous procedures. Air Kerma (AK in units of mGy) was documented for all the cases using a commercial radiation exposure management system. Result(s): When considering all NIR procedures, median AK decreased from 1194 mGy to 561 mGy. When considering all VIR procedures, median AK decreased from 49 to 14 mGy. Both NIR and VIR exhibited a decrease in AK exceeding 50% after ClarityIQ implementation, a statistically significant (p<0.05) difference. Of the 5 most common VIR procedures, all median AK values decreased, but significance (p<0.05) was only reached in venous access (N=53), angio mesenteric (N=41), and drain placement procedures (N=31). Conclusion(s): ClarityIQ can reduce dose significantly for both NIR and VIR procedures. Image quality was not assessed in conjunction with the dose reduction.",Excluded
2930,"Time resolved dosimetry of human brain exposed to low frequency pulsed magnetic fields. An accurate dosimetry is a key issue to understanding brain stimulation and related interaction mechanisms with neuronal tissues at the basis of the increasing amount of literature revealing the effects on human brain induced by low-level, low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs). Most literature on brain dosimetry estimates the maximum E field value reached inside the tissue without considering its time pattern or tissue dispersivity. Nevertheless a time-resolved dosimetry, accounting for dispersive tissues behavior, becomes necessary considering that the threshold for an effect onset may vary depending on the pulse waveform and that tissues may filter the applied stimulatory fields altering the predicted stimulatory waveform's size and shape. In this paper a time-resolved dosimetry has been applied on a realistic brain model exposed to the signal presented in Capone et al (2009 J. Neural Transm. 116 257-65), accounting for the broadband dispersivity of brain tissues up to several kHz, to accurately reconstruct electric field and current density waveforms inside different brain tissues. The results obtained by exposing the Duke's brain model to this PMF signal show that the E peak in the brain is considerably underestimated if a simple monochromatic dosimetry is carried out at the pulse repetition frequency of 75 Hz.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Quantitative imaging and dosimetry are crucial for individualized treatment during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). (177)Lu-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC/(68)Ga-DOTATATE are used, respectively, for PRRT and PET examinations targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of the study was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the performance of (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE in the context of subsequent PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE under standardized conditions in the same patient as well as to investigate the sufficiency of standardized uptake value (SUV) for estimation of SSTR expression.METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors underwent one 45-min dynamic and 3 whole-body PET/CT examinations at 1, 2, and 3 h after injection with both tracers. The number of detected lesions, SUVs in lesions and normal tissue, total functional tumor volume, and SSTR volume (functional tumor volume multiplied by mean SUV) were investigated for each time point. Net uptake rate (Ki) was calculated according to the Patlak method for 3 tumors per patient.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in lesion count, lesion SUV, Ki, functional tumor volume, or SSTR volume between (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE at any time point. The detection rate was similar, although with differences for single lesions in occasional patients. For healthy organs, marginally higher uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE was observed in kidneys, bone marrow, and liver at 1 h. (68)Ga-DOTATOC uptake was higher in mediastinal blood pool at the 1-h time point (P = 0.018). The tumor-to-liver ratio was marginally higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC at the 3-h time point (P = 0.037). Blood clearance was fast and similar for both tracers. SUV did not correlate with Ki linearly and achieved saturation for a Ki of greater than 0.2 mL/cm(3)/min, corresponding to an SUV of more than 25.CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE are suited equally well for staging and patient selection for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE. However, the slight difference in the healthy organ distribution and excretion may render (68)Ga-DOTATATE preferable. SUV did not correlate linearly with Ki and thus may not reflect the SSTR density accurately at its higher values, whereas Ki might be the outcome measure of choice for quantification of SSTR density and assessment of treatment outcome.",Excluded
1388,"The effect of a 50 Hz magnetic field on cognitive function in humans. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the power frequency magnetic field of 0.6mT applied to humans has an effect on cognitive function as has been suggested by animal studies. These fields are less than the suggested intervention level in the UK of 1.6mT and are similar to those found close to some domestic appliances.METHOD AND MATERIALS: A randomized three-way cross-over design using a battery of computerized cognitive function tests were used in the presence or absence of a 50Hz or static magnetic field. Sixteen healthy volunteers undertook two training and three test sessions with a 50Hz or static 0.6 mT magnetic field from a set of coils centred on the head.RESULTS: In response to the 50 Hz field, disruptions of accuracy were seen from an attentional task (the ability to correctly recognize words shown 20min previously and the ability to maintain a string of digits in working memory). There was no similar response to comparable levels of static magnetic field.CONCLUSIONS: These tests indicated at least temporary deterioration in attention, and working and secondary memory performance while a 50 Hz field is applied. There were no adverse effects on speed from any of the tasks. It was not possible in this study to be sure if these effects were persistent.",Excluded
949,"[Orthostatic hypotension after space flight]. Cardiovascular changes occur during spaceflight. Because of the loss of hydrostatic pressure there is, during weightlessness, a fluid shift of extra- and intra-vascular volumes to the upper part of the body. This provokes objective and subjective symptoms, especially in the first days of spaceflight. The fluid shift is perceived by baroreceptors as a relative central hypervolaemia and induces neuro-hormonal mechanisms which provoke a real hypovolaemia. Cardiovascular deconditioning exists during spaceflight with the following symptoms when astronauts return to earth: decreased orthostatic tolerance with possible tendency towards spontaneous syncope and decreased effort capacity. The mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance are not well known. Several factors are probably involved, including hypovolaemia, modifications of the venous system, baroreflex changes, etc. Various countermeasures have been tested in microgravity simulations on the ground, then in flight.

2820,"Space flight and neurovestibular adaptation. Space flight represents a form of sensory stimulus rearrangement requiring modification of established terrestrial response patterns through central reinterpretation. Evidence of sensory reinterpretation is manifested as postflight modifications of eye/head coordination, locomotor patterns, postural control strategies, and illusory perceptions of self or surround motion in conjunction with head movements. Under normal preflight conditions, the head is stabilized during locomotion, but immediately postflight reduced head stability, coupled with inappropriate eye/head coordination, results in modifications of gait. Postflight postural control exhibits increased dependence on vision which compensates for inappropriate interpretation of otolith and proprioceptive inputs. Eye movements compensatory for perceived self motion, rather than actual head movements have been observed postflight. Overall, the in-flight adaptive modification of head stabilization strategies, changes in head/eye coordination, illusionary motion, and postural control are maladaptive for a return to the terrestrial environment.

181,"Autofluorescence spectroscopy as a proxy for chronic white matter pathology. Background: The balance of tissue injury and repair ultimately determines outcomes of chronic neurological disorders, such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the extent of pathology can be difficult to detect, particularly when it is insidious and/or offset by tissue regeneration. Objective(s): The objective of this research is to evaluate whether tissue autofluorescence-typically a source of contamination-provides a surrogate marker of white matter injury. Method(s): Tissue autofluorescence in autopsied specimens both experimental and clinical was characterized by spectral confocal microscopy and correlated to severity and chronicity as determined by standard histopathology. Result(s): Months after cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination, despite robust remyelination, autofluorescent deposits progressively accumulated in regions of prior pathology. Autofluorescent deposits (likely reflecting myelin debris remnants) were conspicuously localized to white matter, proportional to lesion severity, and displayed differential fluorescence over time. Strikingly, similar features were apparent also in autopsied MS tissue. Conclusion(s): Autofluorescence spectroscopy illuminates prior and ongoing white matter injury. The accumulation of autofluorescence in proportion to the extent of progressive atrophy, despite robust remyelination in the CPZ brain, provides important proof-of-concept of a phenomenon (insidious ongoing damage masked by mechanisms of tissue repair) that we hypothesize is highly relevant to the progressive phase of MS.

1664,"Schizophrenia-like behavioral changes after partial hippocampal kindling. The effect of hippocampal kindling on behavioral changes following 10 and 21 hippocampal afterdischarges (ADs) or electrographic seizures was examined in behaving rats. As compared to control, non-stimulated rats, 21 but not 10 hippocampal ADs resulted in a decrease in social contact, an increase in social isolation, and an increase in climbing and chasing behavior tested in an open field 3 days after cessation of kindling. Porsolt forced swimming test was not different among the control, 10- or 21-AD groups of rats. A deficit in sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition of an acoustic startle, was observed in kindled as compared to control rats at 2 weeks after 21 ADs, but not after 10 ADs. Similarly, methamphetamine (1 mg/kg i.p.) induced higher locomotor activity in kindled rats, as compared to controls, after 21 ADs but not after 10 ADs. Spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel cage, without drug administration, was not different between kindled and control rats. These findings suggest that behavioral alterations after repeated hippocampal electrographic seizures may be mediated by increased dopaminergic functions, which may also mediate the psychiatric symptoms in human epileptic patients.",Excluded

2170,"Airborne isolation: Public health infringes on palliative care. Introduction: Development of cavitary lung lesions in a palliative care patient with metastatic lung cancer necessitated invasive diagnostic studies to rule out contagious tuberculosis. Case report: This 63 year old African American man was initially treated with chemotherapy and radiation of an inoperable right upper lobe squamous cell lung carcinoma. He subsequently developed brain metastases which were treated with radiation. Six weeks afterwards he developed progressive weakness and dyspnea on exertion. Computerized tomography of the chest showed two large cavitary lesions. He was transferred from the palliative care unit to a respiratory isolation room. Bronchoalveloar lavage was performed yielding negative smears x 5 for M. tuberculosis. Cultures grew Pneumocystis jiroveci. Smears also demonstrated Candida species and Aspergilla. Antibiotic coverage was broadened for these agents with improvement in his symptoms. Discussion(s): Treatment in palliative care is directed towards symptom management. In this care, however, the possibility of a highly contagious illness necessitated a more aggressive diagnostic approach. In ethical terms the protection of the health of those persons attending this patient (distributive justice) superseded the patient's choice for palliative measures (autonomy). This tension between distributive justice and autonomy is unusual in palliative care.",Excluded
861,"Development of the gravity sensing system. The utricle and saccule contain hair cells, which are the peripheral sensors of change in gravity that transmit signals regarding these changes to the neural components of the vestibular system. Although the fundamental neural pathways, especially the vestibular reflex pathways, have been investigated extensively, the principals underlying the functional development of this system are under study at present. The objective of this review is to identify the gravity-sensing components of the vestibular system and to present an overview of the research performed on their development. The second part of this review is focused on one important aspect of development, the emergence of electrical excitability using the chick tangential vestibular nucleus as a model. The importance of this research to understanding vestibular compensation and vestibular disturbance during spaceflight is considered. Because there is a conservation of the fundamental pathways and function in vertebrate phylogeny from birds through mammals, findings from studies on avians should contribute significantly to understanding the mechanisms operating in mammals. Also, we expect that as the events and basic mechanisms underlying normal vestibular development are revealed, these will provide practical tools to investigate the pattern of recovery from dysfunction of the vestibular system. This is related to the evidence suggesting that recovery of function in different systems and cell lines, including neurons, involves repeating certain patterns established during development. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
806,"Monte Carlo simulation of the spatial resolution and depth sensitivity of two-dimensional optical imaging of the brain. Absorption or fluorescence-based two-dimensional (2-D) optical imaging is widely employed in functional brain imaging. The image is a weighted sum of the real signal from the tissue at different depths. This weighting function is defined as ""depth sensitivity."" Characterizing depth sensitivity and spatial resolution is important to better interpret the functional imaging data. However, due to light scattering and absorption in biological tissues, our knowledge of these is incomplete. We use Monte Carlo simulations to carry out a systematic study of spatial resolution and depth sensitivity for 2-D optical imaging methods with configurations typically encountered in functional brain imaging. We found the following: (i) the spatial resolution is <200 mum for NA<=0.2 or focal plane depth<=300 mum. (ii) More than 97% of the signal comes from the top 500 mum of the tissue. (iii) For activated columns with lateral size larger than spatial resolution, changing numerical aperature (NA) and focal plane depth does not affect depth sensitivity. (iv) For either smaller columns or large columns covered by surface vessels, increasing NA and/or focal plane depth may improve depth sensitivity at deeper layers. Our results provide valuable guidance for the optimization of optical imaging systems and data interpretation.",Excluded
2685,"Association of Radioactive Iodine Treatment with Cancer Mortality in Patients with Hyperthyroidism. Importance: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used extensively to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1940s. Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hyperthyroidism. Objective(s): To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR = 1 + ERR). The current analyses were conducted from April 28, 2017, to January 30, 2019. Exposures: Mean total administered activity of sodium iodide I 131 was 375 MBq for patients with Graves disease and 653 MBq for patients with toxic nodular goiter. Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Result(s): A total of 18805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n = 1984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P =.002), including female breast cancer (n = 291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P =.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n = 1693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P =.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. Copyright © 2019 American Medical Association.

3517,"Spatial buffering of light-evoked potassium increases by retinal Muller (glial) cells. Activity-dependent variations in extracellular potassium concentration in the central nervous system may be regulated, in part, by potassium spatial buffering currents in glial cells. The role of spatial buffering in the retina was assessed by measuring light-evoked potassium changes in amphibian eyecups. The amplitude of potassium increases in the vitreous humor was reduced to approximately 10 percent by 50 micromolar barium, while potassium increases in the inner plexiform layer were largely unchanged. The decrease in the vitreal potassium response was accurately simulated with a numerical model of potassium current flow through Muller cells, the principal glial cells of the retina. Barium also substantially increased the input resistance of Muller cells and blocked the Muller cell-generated M-wave, indicating that barium blocks the potassium channels of Muller cells. Thus, after a light-evoked potassium increase within the retina, there is a substantial transfer of potassium from the retina to the vitreous humor by potassium current flow through Muller cells.",Excluded

In this study, the effect of the ischemic neurodegeneration of the thoracic sympathetic nuclei (TSN) on the heart rate (HR) was examined following a spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SSAH).METHODS: This study was conducted on 22 rabbits. Five rabbits were used as a control group, five as SHAM, and twelve as a study group. The animals' HRs were recorded via monitoring devices on the first day, and those results were accepted as baseline values. The HRs were remeasured after injecting 0.5 cc of isotonic saline for SHAM and 0.5 cc of autolog arterial blood into the thoracic spinal subarachnoid space at T4-T5 for the study group. After a three-week follow-up with continuous monitoring of their HRs, the rabbit's thoracic spinal cords and stellate ganglia were extracted. The specimens were evaluated by histopathological methods. The densities of degenerated neurons in the TSN and stellate ganglia were compared with the HRs.RESULTS: The mean HRs and mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia in control group were 251+/-18/min, 5+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 3+/-1/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The mean HRs and the mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia were detected as 242+/-13/min, 6+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 4+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup> in SHAM (P>0.05 vs. control); 176+/-19/min, 94+/-12/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 28+/-6/mm<sup>3</sup> in the study group (P<0.0001 vs. control and P<0.005 vs. SHAM), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: SAH induced TSN neurodegeneration may have been responsible for low HRs following SSAH.

Background: Former National Football League (NFL) players have higher rates of delayed neurological, cognitive and affective impairments. Those impairments have been attributed to pathologic effects of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI), characterized by shearing of neuronal axons and inflammatory response. We recently showed that [11C]DPA-713 PET-based neuroimaging (DPA-PET) is a promising tool to quantify increased expression of translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of brain injury and repair, in former NFL players. Here we sought to use DPA-PET in active and recently retired NFL players to test for changes in binding to TSPO. Method(s): We quantified regional distribution (VT) of TSPO using DPA-PET in the brains of a novel set of nine active and recently retired NFL players and eight age-matched, athletic, healthy controls. Diffusion tensor imaging was also completed to evaluate white matter changes in the brains of these individuals. Result(s): Using two-way ANOVA with cohort (NFL players, controls) and TSPO genotype as fixed factors, DPA-PET VT values were signiflcantly increased in several brain regions in NFL players compared to controls, particularly in thalamus and brainstem. We also found signiflcantly diminished fractional anisotrophy in the right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) and signiflcantly increased mean diffusivity (MD) in bilateral PTRs. Conclusion(s): Findings from this pilot study of young NFL players support a model wherein microglial activation is an early, persistent response in select brain structures after rmTBI. DPA-PET in NFL athletes may prove useful in further characterizing the inflammatory response after rmTBI and in probing the mechanistic link to onset of cognitive and affective disease.",Excluded

Background: Since radiation exposure in interventional radiology is of growing interest and the number of performed endovascular stroke treatments (EST), i. e. mechanical thrombectomy (MT)-is increasing, the demand of dose reference levels (DRL) is growing. This study was performed to quantify the additional radiation exposure (RE) and fluoroscopy time (FT) needed in patients treated for a tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation compared to patients without a preceding carotid artery occlusion or stenosis receiving EST. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained stroke database of a comprehensive stroke center focusing on the RE (as per dose area product in muGy*m2, median [IQR]), procedure and FT (in minutes, median [IQR]) in patients receiving carotid artery stenting (CAS) and MT in the anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Patients who received CAS and MT were matched with patients needing only MT according to number of thrombectomy maneuvers, location of intracranial occlusion, mode of anesthesia, gender and age (order of decreasing priority). Ergebnisse: Overall 236 patients (n = 118 in each group) have been included in this analysis. Additionally to matching criteria, there was no significant difference in patient's pre-morbid degree of disability (as per modified Rankin Scale), initial severity of stroke symptoms (as per National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), and administration of i. v. rtPA or time from stroke onset to groin puncture in patients with known symptom onset. Procedure times (CAS+: 121 [80-176]; CAS-: 66 [45-106]), fluoroscopy times (CAS+: 57 [37-88]; CAS-: 3 2 [20-53]) as well as radiation exposure (CAS+: 19042 [13603-28722]; CAS-: 12379 [9307-18969]) were significantly higher in patients receiving CAS (all p-values: <0.0001). This is a relative median increase of radiation exposure of 53.8% and a relative increase of 78.2% of fluoroscopy time.

Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV matching in 556/581 patients (95.7%). The procedure was aborted due to pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2 patients, <0.5%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5%). There were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1 patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation.

We have previously shown that oxidation of fALS-associated mutant SODs produces aggregates that have the same morphological, structural, and tinctorial features as those found in SOD1 inclusion bodies in ALS. Here, we show that oxidative damage of wild type SOD at physiological concentrations ( approximately 40 microm) results in destabilization and aggregation in vitro. Oxidation of either mutant or wild type SOD1 causes the enzyme to dissociate to monomers prior to aggregation. Only small changes in secondary and tertiary structure are associated with monomer formation.

Of 2,583 metastases treated, 36 were excised due to symptomatic enlargement. Only TRIC, without residual evidence of tumor, was seen in 36 % (13/36) of specimens. Resection of these lesions resulted in 100 % local control in follow-up. Of the remaining 23 lesions that contained any viable-appearing tumor within the resected specimen, 8 recurred after resection. Lesions that enlarged in the first 6 months were more likely to contain higher amounts of residual tumor cells. Patients with even <2 % tumors cells on excision had significantly worse local control (75 vs. 100 %, p = 0.024) and survival (HR 0.27, p = 0.029) compared with those patients with exclusively TRIC. In summary, our findings underscore the importance of surgically obtaining tissue in a method that facilitates complete lesional interpretive histology in order to accurately guide ongoing patient management.",Excluded
3292,"Rhenium-188(Sn)HEDP for treatment of osseous metastases. UNLABELLED: Rhenium-188 (tin) hydroxyethylidine diphosphonate [188Re(Sn)HEDP] is a new radiopharmaceutical that localizes in skeletal metastases and emits beta particles that may be therapeutically beneficial.METHODS: It was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo testing in the laboratory, in animals and in humans using 188Re from a variety of sources. It may be produced by a desk-top method developed previously for 186Re(Sn)HEDP using 188Re produced through neutron irradiation of either enriched 187Re or naturally occurring rhenium targets or the use of a 188W/188Re generator.RESULTS: So long as the mass of rhenium in the 188Re-perrhenate to be processed into 188Re(Sn)HEDP is at least 100 microg, satisfactory radiochemical yields and purity may be obtained by all methods. The 188Re(Sn)HEDP has biodistribution and radiation dosimetry characteristics that are similar to those noted previously for 186Re(Sn)HEDP and appears to result in similar benefits and toxicities in patients with skeletal metastases. External radiation exposure monitoring indicates that, only 4 hr after a therapeutic administration of 1110 MBq (30 mCi) of 188Re(Sn)HEDP, average exposure rates at 1 meter from the patient would be only 0.5 mR/hr.CONCLUSION: Same-day, on-demand, outpatient therapy of disseminated skeletal metastases appears to be feasible with 188Re(Sn)HEDP.",Excluded
1512,"Regulation of the DNA damage kinase ATM in the immune system. ATM is the protein kinase that is mutated in the hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). A-T patients display immune deficiencies, cancer predisposition, neuronal degeneration and radiosensitivity. The molecular role of ATM is to respond to DNA double-strand breaks and alterations in chromatin structure by phosphorylating its substrates, thereby promoting repair of damage or arresting the cell cycle. ATM is activated by two known co-factors in a stimulus dependent manner. Following the induction of double-strand breaks by ionising radiation, NBS1 (mutated in Nijmegen breakage syndrome) is required for activation of ATM. ATM can also be activated in the absence of DNA damage by agents that induce changes in chromatin structure. We have recently described ATMIN, for ATM INteractor, to be required for ATM activation under these conditions. How ATM is regulated within the context of the immune system is unclear. We are using genetic mouse models to dissect the contribution of the ATM co-factors, ATMIN and NBS, to its function within the immune system. We will present data on how ATM is regulated within lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, in order to maintain a functional immune system and suppress tumorigenesis.",Excluded
358,"Comparison of 3 Tesla proton MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion and MR diffusion for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects. Purpose: To compare 3 Tesla (3T) multi-voxel and single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (MRS), dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI (DSC), and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for distinguishing recurrent glioma from postradiation injury. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed all 3T MRS, DSC and DWI studies performed for suspicion of malignant glioma recurrence between October 2006 and December 2008. Maximum Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr peak-area and peak-height ratios were recorded for both multi-voxel and single-voxel MRS. Maximum cerebral blood volume (CBV) and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were normalized to white matter. Histopathology and clinical-radiologic follow-up served as reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves for each parameter were compared. Result(s): Forty lesions were classified as glioma recurrence (n = 30) or posttreatment effect (n = 10). Diagnostic performance was similar for CBV ratio (AUC = 0.917, P < 0.001), multi-voxel Cho/Cr peak-area (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), and multi-voxel Cho/NAA peak-height (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), while ADC ratio (AUC = 0.726, P = 0.035) did not appear to perform as well. Single-voxel MRS parameters did not reliably distinguish tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Conclusion(s): A 3T DSC and multi-voxel MRS Cho/Cr peak-area and Cho/NAA peak-height appear to outperform DWI for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects. Single-voxel MRS parameters do not appear to distinguish glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects reliably, and therefore should not be used in place of multi-voxel MRS. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

1073,"Arterial Spin-Labeling Perfusion MR Imaging Demonstrates Regional CBF Decrease in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Regional cerebral blood flow has previously been studied in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus with imaging methods that require an intravenous contrast agent or expose the patient to ionizing radiation. The purpose of this study was to assess regional CBF in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus compared with healthy controls using the noninvasive quantitative arterial spin-labeling MR imaging technique. A secondary aim was to compare the correlation between symptom severity and CBF.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differences in regional cerebral perfusion between patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and healthy controls were investigated with pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling perfusion MR imaging. Twenty-one consecutive patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and 21 age- and sex-matched randomly selected healthy controls from the population registry were prospectively included. The controls did not differ from patients with respect to selected vascular risk factors. Twelve different anatomic ROIs were manually drawn on coregistered FLAIR images. The Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied to statistical analyses.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, perfusion was reduced in the periventricular white matter (P < .001), lentiform nucleus (P < .001), and thalamus (P < .001) compared with controls. Cognitive function in patients correlated with CBF in the periventricular white matter (r = 0.60, P < .01), cerebellum (r = 0.63, P < .01), and pons (r = 0.71, P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Using pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling, we could confirm findings of a reduced perfusion in the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus previously observed with other imaging techniques.",Excluded

2369,"The white 'matter' in obsessive compulsive disorder: Effect of pharmacological treatment and symptom dimensions models. Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is highly heterogeneous in its manifestations, both across patients and within the same patient over time. The disorder is probably best described by a multidimensional model involving several symptom dimensions, whose precise number and phenotypes are debated. This heterogeneity partly explains, beyond methodological discrepancies, the inconsistency of results in current brain imaging research in the disorder, particularly in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Purpose(s): We aimed at investigating white matter (WM) alterations associated with OCD, controlling for the impact of variables known to affect WM structure, and specifically for the effect of current and lifetime pharmacological treatment. Then, we tested two different symptom dimensions models [1,2] within OCD patients, analysing theirWMcorrelates, for both prevailing current symptom dimension and symptom dimension at onset. Method(s): We compared 58 adult pure-OCD patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC), with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics on diffusion tensor images, using TFCE correction (p = 0.05). With respect to symptom dimensions, separate analyses were carried on the sole OCD sample. The diffusion measures Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were used as parameters of WM organisation. Result(s): The observed differences between OCD patients and HC were totally carried by the effect of previous and current medications. No differences were in fact observed between drugna ive patients and HC. Current medication was associated with a widespread decrease of FA and increase of RD throughout the whole brain. Lifetime treatment was associated with a decrease in FA in the tracts surrounding the thalami, site of major neurotransmitter alteration in OCD. In the analysis of symptom dimensions, only a finer-grained five-factors model [2] allowed for the identification of specific neural correlates. Patients having current Symmetry/Perfectionism dimension show a reduction in RD and MD in the body of corpus callosum and in left higher-order visual association tracts, including: left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and/or inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, patients having Doubt/Checking dimension at onset show a widespread reduction of AD, encompassing corpus callosum, and bilaterally the thalamic radiations, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Finally, patients having Rituals/Superstition dimension at onset show an increase in FA in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits: genu of corpus callosum, bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations and left external capsule. Conclusion(s): Present results confirm the effect of medications on WM in OCD [3], showing a large effect of current treatment on myelination and a site-specific, disorder-specific, effect of medications on brain systems. Furthermore, our findings provide support to a multidimensional model of OCD, and indicate that the distinction of clinically homogeneous dimensions is essential for the identification of reliable neural correlates. Finally, we evidence, to our knowledge for the first time, that onset symptom dimensions are associated with enduring alterations of WM structure. Onset symptom dimensions may reflect underlying endophenotypes, and our results suggest their relevance for future investigations on OCD neuroanatomy and aetiopathology.",Excluded
2871,"Pulmonary tissue volume, cardiac output, and diffusing capacity in sustained microgravity. In microgravity (microG) humans have marked changes in body fluids, with a combination of an overall fluid loss and a redistribution of fluids in the cranial direction. We investigated whether interstitial pulmonary edema develops as a result of a headward fluid shift or whether pulmonary tissue fluid volume is reduced as a result of the overall loss of body fluid. We measured pulmonary tissue volume (Vti), capillary blood flow, and diffusing capacity in four subjects before, during, and after 10 days of exposure to microG during spaceflight. Measurements were made by rebreathing a gas mixture containing small amounts of acetylene, carbon monoxide, and argon. Measurements made early in flight in two subjects showed no change in Vti despite large increases in stroke volume (40%) and diffusing capacity (13%) consistent with increased pulmonary capillary blood volume. Late in-flight measurements in four subjects showed a 25% reduction in Vti compared with preflight controls (P < 0.001). There was a concomittant reduction in stroke volume, to the extent that it was no longer significantly different from preflight control. Diffusing capacity remained elevated (11%; P < 0.05) late in flight. These findings suggest that, despite increased pulmonary perfusion and pulmonary capillary blood volume, interstitial pulmonary edema does not result from exposure to microG.",Excluded

378,"Dual role of MRK in glioblastoma invasion and radio-resistance. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, has poor prognosis both because of diffuse infiltration of tumor cells in the normal parenchyma and resistance to radiation treatment and chemotherapy. We found that MRK, a stress-activated MAP3K protein kinase, is overexpressed in GBM compared with normal brain tissue, evident in microarray expression data and confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. We have shown that MRK can be activated by at least two distinct signaling inputs: MRK kinase activity is stimulated by ionizing radiation (IR) downstream of NBS1 and ATM in a pathway that leads to activation of Chk2 and cell-cycle arrest. We also showed that downregulation of MRK by RNA interference sensitizes SNB19 and U87 GBM cells to IR. In addition, MRK functions as an effector of RhoC in a pathway that is initiated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a motogenic factor that is overproduced in GBM tumors. We also showed that MRK depletion impairs LPA-stimulated invasion in GBM cells. To examine the role of MRK in GBM in vivo, we used an orthotopic xenograft model. Human GBM explant cells (GBM6) were maintained in nude mice as flank tumors, transduced in vitro with lentiviruses expressing control or MRK shRNA, and subsequently implanted into the brains of nude mice. Control mice had a median survival of 47 days, whereas downregulation of MRK increased survival by 14 days. In a parallel experiment, mice were treated with 20-Gy radiation in 10 fractions over 5 days. This radiation treatment on its own increased survival by only 7 days; in contrast, downregulation of MRK had a strongly synergistic effect, extending survival by more than 35 days. In conclusion, these data validate MRK as a novel target for GBM therapy.",Excluded

Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of four-field box whole brain radiotherapy (FB-WBRT) with tilting baseplate by comparing bilateral WBRT (B-WBRT). Methods and Materials: Between March 2016 and September 2018, 20 patients with brain metastases underwent WBRT using the four-field box technique. WBRT is performed with a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions daily. Two computed tomography simulations per person were performed. One was in the traditional supine position for B-WBRT and the other by applying the tilting acrylic supine baseplate to elevate the head by 40degree for FB-WBRT. The B-WBRT used the field-in-field technique, which is the most commonly used method in our institution. The FB-WBRT comprised anterior, posterior, and bilateral beams. A wedge was applied in anterior and posterior fields to compensate for skull convexity. Result(s): The average of Dmean of both parotid glands was 10.2 Gy (range, 3.8 to 17.8 Gy) in B-WBRT and 5.4 Gy (range, 2.0 to 11.7 Gy) in FB-WBRT (p < 0.05). Compared to B-WBRT, FB-WBRT reduced the mean dose of the right and left parotid glands from 10.1 Gy to 4.9 Gy and from 10.4 Gy to 5.8 Gy, respectively (p < 0.05). Further, V<inf>5</inf>, V<inf>10</inf>, V<inf>15</inf>, V<inf>20</inf>, and V<inf>25</inf> for the parotid gland decreased significantly in FB-WBRT (p < 0.05). The Dmax and Dmean of lens decreased according to the dose-volume histogram.

2560,"Abnormal white matter integrity in elderly patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: A tract-based spatial statistics study. Objectives: We investigated white matter integrity utilizing diffusion tensor imaging in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) patients who had a positive response to the cerebrospinal fluid tap test and age- and gender-matched Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Method(s): We enrolled 28 patients with INPH, 28 patients with AD, and 20 healthy controls. Tract-based spatial statistics demonstrated that INPH patients had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the anterior corona radiata, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation, external capsule, and middle cerebellar peduncle in comparison with the AD and control groups. Result(s): In these regions showing lower FA in the INPH group, volume-ofinterest analysis revealed that INPH patients, when compared to the AD and control groups, showed higher mean diffusivity in the anterior corona radiata, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and middle cerebellar peduncle. And gait dysfunction was significantly correlated with decreased FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum and right external capsule in INPH patients. Conclusion(s): Our findings may suggest a possibility for considering microstructural changes in white matter integrity in elderly patients as potential imaging markers for differentiation between INPH and AD, and may help us understand the potential pathophysiology of gait disturbances associated with INPH.",Excluded
3497,"Accurate event-driven motion compensation in high-resolution PET incorporating scattered and random events. With continuing improvements in spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, small patient movements during PET imaging become a significant source of resolution degradation. This work develops and investigates a comprehensive formalism for accurate motion-compensated reconstruction which at the same time is very feasible in the context of high-resolution PET. In particular, this paper proposes an effective method to incorporate presence of scattered and random coincidences in the context of motion (which is similarly applicable to various other motion correction schemes). The overall reconstruction framework takes into consideration missing projection data which are not detected due to motion, and additionally, incorporates information from all detected events, including those which fall outside the field-of-view following motion correction. The proposed approach has been extensively validated using phantom experiments as well as realistic simulations of a new mathematical brain phantom developed in this work, and the results for a dynamic patient study are also presented.",Excluded
2650,"The dual-peak light response of ganglion cells in chicken retina. In the present study, a particular temporal pattern of the ganglion cells' light response specified as ""dual-peak"" was observed. In the chicken retina (N=15), about 37.5% (174 out of 464) of the ganglion cells showed such special temporal property in response to the onset of light flash. These neurons responded to light stimulus with two successive components: a transient increase of firing rate which lasted for less than 100 ms, and another prolonged light response appeared in about 100 ms after the first transient response. Moreover, our data demonstrated a temporal adaptation process in the later phase of firing activities when repeated flashes were applied. Meanwhile, the earlier phase had a more stable latency in response to the stimulus. Application of picrotoxin could evoke the dual-peak responses in transient ganglion cells. These results suggest that the origination of the two response components might be distinct and the later one is likely related to GABAergic pathways.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) effects of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) are studied in long-term small cell lung cancer (SCLC) survivors. The exact significance and pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity is still unknown, as studies on this subject lack sufficient patient numbers and are performed in an extremely varied manner.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-nine survivors (> 2 years from diagnosis) were examined neurologically and neuropsychologically, and underwent a cranial computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR). Eight patients were excluded from further analysis for various reasons (not SCLC-related CNS disease, n = 6; no chemotherapy nor PCI treatment, n = 2). The remaining 51 patients were divided into three groups; group 1 = chemotherapy alone (n = 21), group 2 = sequential PCI (n = 19), and group 3 = concurrent or sandwiched PCI (n = 11). Groups were neuropsychologically compared in matched controls.RESULTS: Performance status did not differ significantly between various treatment groups; all patients remained ambulatory and capable of self-care. Mental impairment (n = 20), motor abnormalities (n = 9), and visual complaints (n = 1), were found in five patients in group 1 (24%), eight patients in group 2 (42%), and eight patients in group 3 (73%). Analysis of brain atrophy revealed no significant results; however, white matter abnormalities were found more frequently in group 3. Neuropsychologically no significant group differences existed, although interference sensitivity and difficulties with divided attention tended to occur more frequently in patients treated with PCI. Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition.",Excluded

AIM: To investigate the effects of glutamate microinjection into hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats and to explore the relevant mechanisms.METHODS: 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (100 mg/kg in 50% ethanol) was instilled into the colon of adult male SD rats to induce UC. A colonic damage score (CDS) was used to indicate the severity of the colonic mucosal damage. The pathological changes in the colonic mucosa were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, biochemical analyses or ELISA. Ten minutes before UC induction, drugs were microinjected into the relevant nuclei in rat brain to produce chemical stimulation or chemical lesion.RESULTS: Microinjection of glutamate (3, 6 and 12 mug) into the PVN dose-dependently decreased the CDS in UC rats. This protective effect was eliminated after kainic acid (0.3 mug) was microinjected into PVN or into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that caused chemical lesion of these nuclei. This protective effect was also prevented when the AVP-V1 receptor antagonist DPVDAV (200 ng) was microinjected into the NTS. The discharge frequency of the vagus was markedly decreased following microinjection of glutamate into the PVN. Microinjection of glutamate into the PVN in UC rats significantly increased the cell proliferation and anti-oxidant levels, and decreased the apoptosis and Bax and caspase 3 expression levels and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors in the colonic mucosa.CONCLUSION: The activation of hypothalamic PVN exerts protective effects against UC, which is mediated by the NTS and vagus. The effects may be achieved via anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory factors.",Excluded

At Austin Health, we decided to perform a CT dose audit to review the CT dose trend and the effect NDRL has had at this practice. Method Retrospective data collection of CTDIvol and DLP values of procedures for 2 years prior to NDRL and 3 years post NDRL were taken. The following non-contrast procedures were audited, CT brain, CT chest, CT abdomen/pelvis and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis scans. Data was collected across 4 CT scanners and their median of the spread per year was taken as the facility reference level (FRL) as defined in the Arpansa National Diagnostic Reference Level Service Fact Sheet. The FRL was then compared with the NDRL values. Results Preliminary results indicate a dose reduction over time since 2009 for most procedures, which may be attributed to dose optimisation, CT technology and the establishment of NDRL as a benchmark for CT dose comparison. Conclusion Regular CT dose audits are useful in managing dose trends and dose optimisation. It can be seen that since the implementation of the NDRL in 2011, there has been a positive trend towards lowering radiation dose associated with CT at this facility.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Brain metastasis (BM) is the main sign of failure of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The lymph node (LN) status is a major determinant of outcome in patients with NSCLC, but whether or not the LN status is a major determinant of BM remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on completely resected staged IIIA (N2) LA-NSCLC to explore the correlation between LN status and BM. We also aimed to identify the risk factors of BM as the initial site of failure, as well as the potential highest-risk candidates who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Materials/Methods: The medical records of 357 consecutive patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who underwent complete surgery were reviewed between January 2005 and June 2012. Time to BM as the initial site of failure was measured from the date of surgery to the date of BM in the patients who developed distant metastases or both local and distant recurrence as the initial failure, with BM defined as an event. The cumulative incidence of BM as the initial site of failure and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. To assess the risk factors of BM, the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis. Result(s): A total of 73 (20.4%) patients developed BM, and 60 patients had BM as their initial site of failure. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year risks for patients developing BM as the initial site of failure were 9.1%, 27.4%, and 35.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.000), positive extra-capsular extension of LN metastasis (P=0.041), number of metastatic LN > 4 (P = 0.018), multiple N2 stations (P = 0.027), and multiple regions of mediastinal LN (MLN) involvement (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing BM as the initial site of failure. Multivariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.002; HR = 5.148; 95% CI = 1.863-14.222) and multiple regions of MLN involvement (P = 0.015; HR = 0.556; 95% CI = 0.326-0.948) were significantly associated with the high risk of BM as the initial site of failure. In patients with nonsquamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement, the fiveyear actuarial risk of BM as the initial failure was 47.6%. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement were independent risk factors for BM as the initial failure in completely resected IIIA (N2) NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement are at the highest risk of developing BM as the initial failure, and may receive a greater benefit from PCI.

Background: Both Gamma-Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and BRAF-inhibitors (BRAF-I) have been shown to be useful in melanoma patients with brain metastases (BM), thus suggesting that it could be interesting to combine their respective advantages. However cases of radiosensitization following conventional radiation therapy in BRAF-I treated patients have raised serious concerns about the real feasibility and risk/benefit ratio of this combination. Method(s): Blind review by 2 independent observers of brain MRI follow-up pictures and survival assessment in all patients who had been treated by GKRS and BRAF-I at a single institution. Result(s): Among53 GKRS performed in 30 patients who ever received BRAF-I and GKRS, 33 GKRS were performed in 24 patients while under BRAF-I treatment, from which only 4 with an interruption of BRAF-I. The 20 other GKRS were performed in 15 patients (including 9 of the 24) before initiation of BRAF-I treatment. Out of the 263 BM treated, only 3 edemas and 3 hemorrhages were detected within 2 months after GKRS and 4 edemas and 7 hemorrhages were detected later. No case of BM radiation necrosis and no scalp radiation dermatitis occurred. Neither the MRI features nor the incidence of the rare adverse events were deemed unexpected in such a population of melanoma BM. Median survival from first GKRS and first dose of BRAF-I was 24.7, and 48.8 weeks, respectively. Conclusion(s): This series does not show immediate radiotoxicity nor radiation-recall, in melanoma patients with BRAF-I whose BM are treated by GKRS. Interrupting BRAF-I for stereotactic radiosurgery of BM seems useless, although it is still advised for other radiation therapies. Overall very favorable survival figures suggest to test the potential benefit of combining stereotactic radiosurgery and BRAF-I.",Excluded

2859,"Risk of Hippocampal Metastases in Small Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for Hippocampal Sparing Cranial Irradiation. Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) decreases the incidence of brain metastases (BMs) and can improve overall survival. However whole brain radiation therapy is associated with a decline in neurocognitive function. Hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) aims to minimise damage to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) within the hippocampus and reduce the toxicity of PCI, although there may be an increased risk of treatment failure in the hippocampal region. The incidence of hippocampal metastases was investigated in patients with BMs from SCLC to evaluate the feasibility of HS-WBRT in this population. Method(s): Patients with SCLC presenting between 2000 and 2016 with BMs at presentation or during their disease course without previous cranial irradiation were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Hippocampal metastases (HMs) were defined as metastases within the hippocampus and a 5-mm radial expansion (hippocampus avoidance zone, according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0933 atlas). The rate of hippocampal metastases and associated clinical features were analysed. Result(s): One hundred and twenty eligible patients with a total of 754 brain metastases were identified. In 67 (55.8%) patients BMs were detected at diagnosis of SCLC and in 53 (44.2%) patients BMs developed later without previous PCI. The median number of metastases was 3, and 27 (22.5%) patients had a single BM. There were 22 (18.3%) patients with hippocampal metastases. A total of 23 (3.1%) metastases involved the hippocampal avoidance area. On logistic regression analysis, the number of brain metastases was an independent risk factor for HMs. Conclusion(s): The overall incidence of hippocampal metastases in our cohort of SCLC patients is high. As HS-WBRT may increase the risk of treatment failure in the spared region, prospective randomised trials are encouraged.

1424,"Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Management of Liver Metastases from Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Preliminary Study. INTRODUCTION: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms. The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is not well understood in this population. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SABR in treating well-differentiated neuroendocrine liver metastases (WD-NELM). METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients with WD-NELM treated with SABR between January 2015-July 2019. Demographic, treatment and clinical/radiographic follow-up data were abstracted. RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied to each individual target to evaluate the response to treatment. Local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE v5.0. RESULT(S): Twenty-five patients with a total of 53 liver metastases treated with SABR were identified. Most patients (68%) had midgut tumors, were Grade II (80%) and had high volume intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic disease (76%). Median number of liver metastases treated was 2 with a median size of 2.5 cm. Median radiation dose delivered was 50Gy/5 fractions. Median follow-up was 14 months; 24 of the 25 patients were alive at time of analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 32%, with improvement or stability in 96% of lesions treated. The median time to best response was 9 months. The 1-year LC and PFS were 92% and 44% respectively. No Grade III/IV acute or late toxicity was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Liver SABR is a safe and promising means of providing local control for WD-NELM. This treatment modality should be evaluated in select patients in concert with strategies to manage systemic disease. Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
717,"Effects of low intensity radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on electrical activity in rat hippocampal slices. Slices of rat hippocampus were exposed to 700 MHz continuous wave radiofrequency (RF) fields (25.2-71.0 V m(-1), 5-15 min exposure) in a stripline waveguide. At low field intensities, the predominant effect on the electrically evoked field potential in CA1 was a potentiation of the amplitude of the population spike by up to 20%, but higher intensity fields could produce either increases or decreases of up to 120 and 80%, respectively, in the amplitude of the population spike. To eliminate the possibility of RF-induced artefacts due to the metal stimulating electrode, the effect of RF exposure on spontaneous epileptiform activity induced in CA3 by 4-aminopyridine (50-100 microM) was investigated. Exposure to RF fields (50.0 V m(-1)) reduced or abolished epileptiform bursting in 36% of slices tested. The maximum field intensity used in these experiments, 71.0 V m(-1), was calculated to produce a specific absorption rate (SAR) of between 0.0016 and 0.0044 W kg(-1) in the slices. Measurements with a Luxtron fibreoptic probe confirmed that there was no detectable temperature change (+/- 0.1 degrees C) during a 15 min exposure to this field intensity. Furthermore, imposed temperature changes of up to 1 degrees C failed to mimic the effects of RF exposure. These results suggest that low-intensity RF fields can modulate the excitability of hippocampal tissue in vitro in the absence of gross thermal effects. The changes in excitability may be consistent with reported behavioural effects of RF fields.",Excluded
2288,"Improvement of dose distribution with irregular surface compensator in whole brain radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dosimetries of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) using irregular surface compensator (ISC) compare with conventional radiotherapy. The ISC involves modulation of the beam with the multileaf collimator (MLC), and increases the dose homogeneity to the target volume while decrease the absorbed dose in irradiated tissues outside the targeted tissue. Treatment plans were produced for 10 patients. All treatments were carried out with 10 MV photon energy from a Clinac iX with 120 MLC (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The prescription dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions at the isocenter. With Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems), the anisotropic analytical algorithm was used for the dose calculation. The tissue heterogeneity correction was used in all the treatment plans. For ISC, the skin flash tool application was used to extend the optimal fluence. These two treatment plans were compared in terms of does in the planning target volume (PTV), the dose homogeneity index (DHI), the maximum doses, eye and lens doses and the monitor unit (MU) counts required for treatment. Average values were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Compared with the conventional WBRT, the ISC significantly reduced the DHI, the maximum dose, the volumes received at 105% of the prescription dose, as well as reducing both eye and lens doses (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). By contrast, the monitor unit counts were increased for ISC technique compared to the conventional WBRT (819 vs. 327, p < 0.01). The ISC technique for WBRT enables significantly better dose distribution in the PTV. As patients who receive WBRT have improved survival, the long-term side effects of radiotherapy become of increasing important. It is expected that with this technique, the risk of late radiotherapy- associated complication will be reduced. The ISC technique has been used in select patients with a long life expectancy at our institution.",Excluded
2955,"Post-radiation gliomas. AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is important in the treatment of neoplasm of the central nervous system, but various side effects, particularly neoplastic, have been described. Recently, post-radiation gliomas have been reported.METHODS: The authors review 88 cases of cerebral glioma following radiotherapy in patients operated for neoplasms of the nervous system, including 6 personal cases of post-radiation gliomas treated in the Neurosurgical Division of the Department of Neurological Sciences, ""La Sapienza"" University, Rome. The criteria used to define this unusual pathologic association are discussed.RESULTS: There was a male predominance. Post-radiation gliomas were particularly malignant, the average dose was 33 Gy, and average free latency was 9.6 years. The first disease was most frequently acute lymphatic leukemia.CONCLUSIONS: Post-radiation gliomas have particular features but do not present a histologic or clinical behavior different from analogous spontaneous gliomas. The fact that 88 cases have been reported in recent years suggests that a thorough biological, clinical studies be carried out on this association. [References: 56]",Excluded
3476,"Diffuse optical imaging of the whole head. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse optical imaging (DOI) are increasingly used to detect hemodynamic changes in the cerebral cortex induced by brain activity. Until recently, the small number of optodes in NIRS instruments has hampered measurement of optical signals from diverse brain regions. Our new DOI system has 32 detectors and 32 sources; by arranging them in a specific pattern, we can cover most of the adult head. With the increased number of optodes, we can collect optical data from prefrontal, sensorimotor, and visual cortices in both hemispheres simultaneously. We describe the system and report system characterization measurements on phantoms as well as on human subjects at rest and during visual, motor, and cognitive stimulation. Taking advantage of the system's larger number of sources and detectors, we explored the spatiotemporal patterns of physiological signals during rest. These physiological signals, arising from cardiac, respiratory, and blood-pressure modulations, interfere with measurement of the hemodynamic response to brain stimulation. Whole-head optical measurements, in addition to providing maps of multiple brain regions' responses to brain activation, will enable better understandings of the physiological signals, ultimately leading to better signal processing algorithms to distinguish physiological signal clutter from brain activation signals.",Excluded
389,"External beam radiotherapy for painful bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma: multiple fractions compared with an 8-Gy single fraction. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) bone metastases has not been popular in palliative therapy, and optimum dose schedules have not been decided because of limited published reports. We here evaluated the palliative effect of EBRT for HCC bone metastases and compared the dose-response relationship between multiple fractions (MFs) and an 8-Gy single fraction (SF). Twenty-eight patients (42 sites) with painful bone metastases who received EBRT and were analyzed retrospectively. Eight patients (12 sites) received SF. Of the remaining 20 patients (30 sites), 10 received MFs at moderate doses (20-30 Gy; 17 sites) and 10 received MFs at high doses (36-52 Gy; 13 sites). Overall response was achieved at 83% (35) of all sites; 75% (9) and 87% (26) for the SF and MF patients (88%, moderate dose; 85%, high dose), respectively. No significant differences in overall response were observed between each fraction schedule. Response duration was significantly longer for the high-dose MF patients than for the SF patients and moderate-dose MF patients (P < 0.05). SF was as effective as MF radiotherapy in terms of pain relief, but high-dose MF delivery relieved pain for a significantly longer duration.",Excluded
3174,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients. Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

Result(s): Between January 2005-August 2009 136 pts were accrued, 129 (75 males, 54 females) were evaluable. Median age was 49 years, 91% had a Zubrod score 0-1 and 69%, 25% and 6% of pts had 3,4 and 5 high risk factors respectively. With a median follow-up time of 4.1 yrs, minimum follow-up of 3 yrs, MST has not yet been reached. Three year OS rate was 73.1% (95%CI:65.3-80.8%), significantly improved from historical control with a p-value <0.0001. No difference in OS rates for pts with 3, 4 or 5 high risk factors was seen. 3 year PFS was 59.2% (95% CI:50.7-67.8%).

2507,"Slice accelerated diffusion-weighted imaging at ultra-high field strength. Purpose Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data with very high isotropic resolution can be obtained at 7T. However, for extensive brain coverage, a large number of slices is required, resulting in long acquisition times (TAs). Recording multiple slices simultaneously (SMS) promises to reduce the TA. Methods A combination of zoomed and parallel imaging is used to achieve high isotropic resolution dMRI data with a low level of distortions at 7T. The blipped-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) approach is used to acquire several slices simultaneously. Due to their high radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and ensuing specific absorption rate (SAR) constraints, the commonly used multiband (MB) RF pulses for SMS imaging are inefficient at 7T and entail long repetition times, counteracting the usefulness of SMS acquisitions. To address this issue, low SAR multislice Power Independent of Number of Slices RF pulses are employed. Results In vivo dMRI results with and without SMS acceleration are presented at different isotropic spatial resolutions at ultra high field strength. The datasets are recorded at a high angular resolution to detect fiber crossings. Conclusion From the results and compared with earlier studies at these resolutions, it can be seen that scan time is significantly reduced, while image quality is preserved. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
881,"Endovascular treatment of superior vena cava syndrome: What you need to know before you start. Background: Malignancy is the major etiologic factor of SVCS. Medical treatment, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are dependent on the histological type and provide clinical relief for a short duration with high recurrence rate. Revascularization by EVT comprising angioplasty and stent placement is the first-line treatment. Clinical Findings/Procedure: Pictorial review of 200 treated patients. Orthopnea and edema of the upper body are the main symptoms but respiratory distress, convulsions, or coma due to cerebral edema are also described. Main causes are tumor invasion (60%-97%) with bronchopulmonary cancers being the most common (60%-90%) followed by lymphomas (6%-25%) and metastases. The tumor may be treated with radiation or chemotherapy, with efficacy rates up to 94% and 77%, respectively, but this varies with histologic types. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and femoral venous access alone is used when possible. Brachial or jugular approaches can be used if dual venous access is required. From our experience, self-expandable stents outperform balloonexpandable stents and thrombolysis may be used before or after stent placement in cases of severe obstruction or stent thrombosis. Relief of symptoms after stenting is usually complete or partial and recurrences may be treated by reintervention. Conclusion(s): EVT for malignancy-related SVCS has a satisfactory level of clinical success with relatively low morbidity and mortality in the context of neoplasm. It also allows the possibility of reintervention in cases of recurrence.",Excluded
2226,"Bidirectional regulation of fragile X mental retardation protein phosphorylation controls rhodopsin homoeostasis. Homoeostatic regulation of the light sensor, rhodopsin, is critical for the maintenance of light sensitivity and survival of photoreceptors. The major fly rhodopsin, Rh1, undergoes light-induced endocytosis and degradation, but its protein and mRNA levels remain constant during light/dark cycles. It is not clear how translation of Rh1 is regulated. Here, we show that adult photoreceptors maintain a constant, abundant quantity of ninaE mRNA, which encodes Rh1. We demonstrate that the Fmr1 protein associates with ninaE mRNA and represses its translation. Further, light exposure triggers a calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of Fmr1, which relieves suppression of Rh1 translation. We demonstrate that Mts, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mediates light-induced Fmr1 dephosphorylation in a regulatory B subunit of PP2A (CKa)-dependent manner. Finally, we show that blocking light-induced Rh1 translation results in reduced light sensitivity. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism of Rh1 homoeostasis and physiological consequence of Rh1 dysregulation.",Excluded
2908,"Feasibility of setting up generic alert levels for maximum skin dose in fluoroscopically guided procedures. Purpose: The feasibility of setting-up generic, hospital-independent dose alert levels to initiate vigilance on possible skin injuries in interventional procedures was studied for three high-dose procedures (chemoembolization (TACE) of the liver, neuro-embolization (NE) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) in 9 European countries. Method(s): Gafchromic films and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the Maximum Skin Dose (MSD). Correlation of the online dose indicators (fluoroscopy time, kerma- or dose-area product (KAP or DAP) and cumulative air kerma at interventional reference point (K<inf>a,r</inf>)) with MSD was evaluated and used to establish the alert levels corresponding to a MSD of 2 Gy and 5 Gy. The uncertainties of alert levels in terms of DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf>, and uncertainty of MSD were calculated. Result(s): About 20-30% of all MSD values exceeded 2 Gy while only 2-6% exceeded 5 Gy. The correlations suggest that both DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf> can be used as a dose indicator for alert levels (Pearson correlation coefficient p mostly >0.8), while fluoroscopy time is not suitable (p mostly <0.6). Generic alert levels based on DAP (Gy cm<sup>2</sup>) were suggested for MSD of both 2 Gy and 5 Gy (for 5 Gy: TACE 750, PCI 250 and NE 400). The suggested levels are close to the lowest values published in several other studies. The uncertainty of the MSD was estimated to be around 10-15% and of hospital-specific skin dose alert levels about 20-30% (with coverage factor k = 1). Conclusion(s): The generic alert levels are feasible for some cases but should be used with caution, only as the first approximation, while hospital-specific alert levels are preferred as the final approach.

The aim of this study was to estimate a plausible alpha/beta ratio for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) based on reported clinical data, and to design possible fractionation regimens suitable for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) for large AVMs based on the newly obtained alpha/beta ratio. The commonly used obliteration rate (OR) for AVMs with a three year angiographic follow-up from many institutes was fitted to linear-quadratic (LQ) formalism and the Poisson OR model. The determined parameters were then used to calculate possible fractionation regimens for IG-IMRT based on the concept of a biologically effective dose (BED) and an equivalent uniform dose (EUD). The radiobiological analysis yields a alpha/beta ratio of 2.2 +/- 1.6 Gy for AVMs. Three sets of possible fractionated schemes were designed to achieve equal or better biological effectiveness than the single-fraction treatments while maintaining the same probability of normal brain complications. A plausible alpha/beta ratio was derived for AVMs and possible fractionation regimens that may be suitable for IG-IMRT for large AVM treatment are proposed. The sensitivity of parameters on the calculation was also studied.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to prospectively characterize toxicity and cosmesis after accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (CRT) or single-entry, multilumen, intracavitary brachytherapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 281 patients with pTis, pT1N0, or pT2N0 (<=3.0 cm) breast cancer treated with segmental mastectomy were prospectively enrolled from December 2008 through August 2014. APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template.RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) <=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance <=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT. Rates of radiation oncologist-reported fair or poor cosmetic outcomes are higher with brachytherapy. We identified dosimetric parameters that predict reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy-based APBI.

163,"Changes in olfactory inputs modify the energy balance response to short days in male gray mouse lemurs. The role of olfaction/olfactory cues on photoperiodic responses was assessed in Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur. When exposed to short photoperiod (SP), this primate demonstrates rapid changes in energy balance as adaptive anticipatory response for winter survival. To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls. These results suggest that olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy balance.",Excluded
2558,"Rod visual pigment optimizes active state to achieve efficient G protein activation as compared with cone visual pigments. Most vertebrate retinas contain two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which show different photoresponses to mediate scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. These cells contain different types of visual pigments, rhodopsin and cone visual pigments, respectively, but little is known about the molecular properties of cone visual pigments under physiological conditions, making it difficult to link the molecular properties of rhodopsin and cone visual pigments with the differences in photoresponse between rods and cones. Here we prepared bovine and mouse rhodopsin (bvRh and mRh) and chicken and mouse green-sensitive cone visual pigments (cG and mG) embedded in nanodiscs and applied time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to compare their Gt activation efficiencies. Rhodopsin exhibited greater Gt activation efficiencies than cone visual pigments. Especially, the Gt activation efficiency of mRh was about 2.5-fold greater than that of mG at 37 degreeC, which is consistent with our previous electrophysiological data of knock-in mice. Although the active state (Meta-II) was in equilibrium with inactive states (Meta-I and Meta-III), quantitative determination of Meta-II in the equilibrium showed that the Gt activation efficiency per Meta-II of bvRh was also greater than those of cG and mG. These results indicated that efficient Gt activation by rhodopsin, resulting from an optimized active state of rhodopsin, is one of the causes of the high amplification efficiency of rods.",Excluded

In this Review, familial and sporadic neurological disorders reported to have an etiological link with DNA repair defects are discussed, with special emphasis placed on the molecular link between the disease phenotype and the precise DNA repair defect. Of the 15 neurological disorders listed, some of which have symptoms of progeria, six - spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this induces. Five of the conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) display a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, four (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) exhibit an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, and four (ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) exhibit defects in genes involved in repairing double-strand breaks.

212,"Morphometric analysis of hypothalamic cells showing c-Fos proteins after movement restriction and EHF-irradiation. A morphometric analysis of hypothalamic cells containing c-Fos-like protein detected by an indirect immunoperoxidase method was carried out to clarify the responses to movement restriction and skin electromagnetic high frequency (EHF) irradiation (7.1 mm, 42.2 GHz, 20 mW output power) simultaneously to three acupuncture projection areas. The morphometry of c-Fos-protein positive neurons by their number and type was analyzed. Movement restriction (40 min) induced c-Fos protein expression primarily in cells with 10-50 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (associative type neurons) only in anterior hypothalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area; while additional EHF-irradiation of acupuncture projection areas (under movement restriction) induced c-Fos expression in all hypothalamic structures and mostly in cells with 70-150 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (relay type neurons), i.e. changed the pattern of activated cell type distribution. In conclusion, the findings show that modest stress under which experimental animals often are exposed increase c-Fos protein expression in hypothalamic centers and skin EHF-irradiation of acupuncture projection areas seem to increase that. © 2008.",Excluded

New generations of multi-detector row CT (MDCT) scanners offer previously unsurpassed options in neurovascular imaging especially for the emergency diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Comprehensive stroke imaging now typically includes CT angiography and CT perfusion in addition to non-contrast-enhanced CT (NECT). Moreover, modern techniques also enable the retrieval of dynamic CT-angiographic data from the perfusion CT. CT angiography of the cervicocranial arteries allows the assessment of the location and degree of supraaortic extra- and intracranial stenoses as well as of occlusions of the basilar artery. In addition, intracranial aneurysms can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity. Cerebrovenous thromboses can be diagnosed with a venous CT angiography of the brain. Even thromboses of small bridging and internal cerebral veins can usually be readily discerned. Copyright © Springer International Publishing AG.",Excluded
3448,"Bevacizumab: radiation combination produces restricted diffusion on brain MRI. AIMS: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of bevacizumab (BEV) on the diffusion properties of irradiated brain gliomas.MATERIALS & METHODS: Neuroimaging studies and medical records of 44 patients undergoing treatment for cerebral gliomas were reviewed. MRIs were analyzed for presence of restricted diffusion, time to onset, pattern/location, duration of restriction, and persistence of restriction post-treatment with BEV.RESULTS: Patchy confluent areas of diffusion restriction on MRI were found in 12 patients. All 12 patients received radiation therapy followed by BEV therapy. Diffusion restriction appeared 3 to 21 months after onset of radiation and 1 to 6 months after starting BEV therapy, increased in size over time, and persisted up to 23 months while on BEV. Restricted diffusion was observed in areas that received 60 Gy or more of radiation. Areas of restricted diffusion showed low T1 and increased T2 signal intensity, minimal or no contrast enhancement, and low cerebral blood volume. A thin perimeter of susceptibility outlined the restricted areas on susceptibility-weighted images in nine patients (75%). Small focal areas of tumor recurrence within larger regions of restricted diffusion were evident in only four patients (33%). In seven patients (58%) the area of restricted diffusion showed necrosis or radiation change on histology or no metabolic activity on MR spectroscopy or PET.CONCLUSION: Restricted diffusion associated with BEV-treated cerebral gliomas occurs in regions of high-dose radiation and does not indicate high-cellularity of tumor recurrence.",Excluded
3069,"Effect of experimental glaucoma on the non-image forming visual system. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, characterized by retinal ganglion cell degeneration and damage to the optic nerve. We investigated the non-image forming visual system in an experimental model of glaucoma in rats induced by weekly injections of chondroitin sulphate (CS) in the eye anterior chamber. Animals were unilaterally or bilaterally injected with CS or vehicle for 6 or 10 weeks. In the retinas from eyes injected with CS, a similar decrease in melanopsin and Thy-1 levels was observed. CS injections induced a similar decrease in the number of melanopsin-containing cells and superior collicular retinal ganglion cells. Experimental glaucoma induced a significant decrease in the afferent pupil light reflex. White light significantly decreased nocturnal pineal melatonin content in control and glaucomatous animals, whereas blue light decreased this parameter in vehicle- but not in CS-injected animals. A significant decrease in light-induced c-Fos expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was observed in glaucomatous animals. General rhythmicity and gross entrainment appear to be conserved, but glaucomatous animals exhibited a delayed phase angle with respect to lights off and a significant increase in the percentage of diurnal activity.

2601,"A histology-based atlas of the C57BL/6J mouse brain deformably registered to in vivo MRI for localized radiation and surgical targeting. The C57BL/6J laboratory mouse is commonly used in neurobiological research. Digital atlases of the C57BL/6J brain have been used for visualization, genetic phenotyping and morphometry, but currently lack the ability to accurately calculate deviations between individual mice. We developed a fully three-dimensional digital atlas of the C57BL/6J brain based on the histology atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001 The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates 2nd edn (San Diego, CA: Academic)). The atlas uses triangular meshes to represent the various structures. The atlas structures can be overlaid and deformed to individual mouse MR images. For this study, we selected 18 structures from the histological atlas. Average atlases can be created for any group of mice of interest by calculating the mean three-dimensional positions of corresponding individual mesh vertices. As a validation of the atlas' accuracy, we performed deformable registration of the lateral ventricles to 13 MR brain scans of mice in three age groups: 5, 8 and 9 weeks old. Lateral ventricle structures from individual mice were compared to the corresponding average structures and the original histology structures. We found that the average structures created using our method more accurately represent individual anatomy than histology-based atlases alone, with mean vertex deviations of 0.044 mm versus 0.082 mm for the left lateral ventricle and 0.045 mm versus 0.068 mm for the right lateral ventricle. Our atlas representation gives direct spatial deviations for structures of interest. Our results indicate that MR-deformable histology-based atlases represent an accurate method to obtain accurate morphometric measurements of a population of mice, and that this method may be applied to phenotyping experiments in the future as well as precision targeting of surgical procedures or radiation treatment. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded

2555,"Rapid enzymatic response to compensate UV radiation in copepods. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes physical damage to DNA, carboxylation of proteins and peroxidation of lipids in copepod crustaceans, ubiquitous and abundant secondary producers in most aquatic ecosystems. Copepod adaptations for long duration exposures include changes in behaviour, changes in pigmentation and ultimately changes in morphology. Adaptations to short-term exposures are little studied. Here we show that short-duration exposure to UVR causes the freshwater calanoid copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, to rapidly activate production of enzymes that prevent widespread collateral peroxidation (glutathione S-transferase, GST), that regulate apoptosis cell death (Caspase-3, Casp-3), and that facilitate neurotransmissions (cholinesterase-ChE). None of these enzyme systems is alone sufficient, but they act in concert to reduce the stress level of the organism. The interplay among enzymatic responses provides useful information on how organisms respond to environmental stressors acting on short time scales. © 2012 Souza et al.",Excluded

GKS (20 Gy single dose) alone and/or drugs (for 3 days) were delivered 14 or 18 days after stereotactic implantation of C6/LacZ glioma cells into the brains of Sprague-Dawley rats. A group of animals treated with or without drugs for 3 days was irradiated on day 18 and sacrificed at 24 h after GKS to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis and microvessel density. The other group of animals was irradiated on day 14 and sacrificed at day 5 after GKS for the measurement of tumor volume. Apoptosis of endothelial cells in the tumor beds was only observed in the early period after GKS. Decreased cell proliferation and increased tumor cell apoptosis were observed in rat gliomas treated with GKS and THD or TMZ. The combination treatments with GKS and THD or GKS and TMZ also decreased microvessel density, i.e. angiogenesis, more effectively compared with GKS treatment alone. The combination of GKS and THD was the most effective regimen, resulting in a significant decrease of tumor volume. We suggest that the antitumor effect of GKS on glioma is enhanced by the addition of THD. Therefore, combined therapy with GKS and THD might be a favorable treatment for gliomas.",Excluded

1047,"Effects of ion channel blocks on electrical activity of stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neural network under electromagnetic induction. The effects of channel blocks on the spontaneous spiking activity and neuron networks pattern selection are investigated by using an improved Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model in which the electromagnetic induction is considered and the magnetic flux is used to describe the influence of electromagnetic field. The discharge behavior of neurons induced by potassium ion and sodium ion channel blocks was analyzed by numerical simulation in the improved HH model. The results suggest that changes in the maximum conductance of potassium channels can cause spontaneous discharge behavior of neurons. The poisoning of potassium ion can be weakened by the electromagnetic radiation in the neural network, and the neural network presents a state of spatial order in the case of spiral waves. It is interesting that the ordered waveform is generated by no-flux boundary condition when the initial states are selected as wedge-shaped type in the network. In addition, potassium channel blocks can promote the discharge of neurons and facilitate the formation of spiral waves in the neural network. By contrast, the electrical activity of neurons is inhibited by sodium channel blocks. The influence of membrane patch size on the electrical activity of single neuron is greater than that on the collective behavior of neural network. This research will enhance understanding of the role of toxins in neuronal firing and collective behavior of real neural systems. Copyright © 2017",Excluded
2548,"""Low-intensity laser therapy effect on the recovery of traumatic spinal cord injury"". Scientific advances have been made to optimize the healing process in spinal cord injury. Studies have been developed to obtain effective treatments in controlling the secondary injury that occurs after spinal cord injury, which substantially changes the prognosis. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been applied in neuroscience due to its anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissue in the repairing process. Few studies have been made associating LILT to the spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the LILT (GaAlAs laser-780 nm) on the locomotor functional recovery, histomorphometric, and histopathological changes of the spinal cord after moderate traumatic injury in rats (spinal cord injury at T9 and T10). Thirty-one adult Wistar rats were used, which were divided into seven groups: control without surgery (n = 3), control surgery (n = 3), laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5), medullar lesion (n = 5) without phototherapy, medullar lesion + laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), and medullar lesion + laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5). The assessment of the motor function was performed using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and adapted Sciatic Functional Index (aSFI). The assessment of urinary dysfunction was clinically performed. After 21 days postoperative, the animals were euthanized for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the spinal cord. The results showed faster motor evolution in rats with spinal contusion treated with LILT, maintenance of the effectiveness of the urinary system, and preservation of nerve tissue in the lesion area, with a notorious inflammation control and increased number of nerve cells and connections. In conclusion, positive effects on spinal cord recovery after moderate traumatic spinal cord injury were shown after LILT.",Excluded

Objective: Computerized Tomography Perfusion (CTP) is used to assess physiological brain tissue parameters in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Its utility for patients presenting within the 3 hrs time window is unknown and questionable given possible delay of thrombolytic administration and additional exposure to radiation. We addressed whether parameters on CTP for AIS patients treated with IV t-PA within 3 hrs of onset are predictive of good or bad outcome. Method(s): We retrospectively identified patients from our stroke registry (7/07 to 2/10) who presented with AIS and underwent CTP and then received tPA within 3 hrs of symptom onset. Patients that underwent intra-arterial therapy were excluded. A neuroradiologist blinded to outcome performed CTP measurements on a commercially available Siemens Neuro PCT workstation. Total perfusion deficit was defined as the area of infarct territory with a relative time to peak greater than 4s compared to the contralateral side (TTP). Nonviable tissue (NVT) was defined as the area of infarct territory with absolute cerebral blood volume (CBV) less than 2ml/100g. Penumbra was defined as the area of TTP minus the area of CBV. Good clinical outcome (GCO) was defined as mRS 0-2, and poor clinical outcome (PCO) was defined as mRS 5-6 at hospital discharge. Clinical perfusion mismatch (CPM) was defined as admit NIHSS >= 8 and NVT <=25cm<sup>2</sup>. Result(s): We identified 44 patients with a mean age of 68 years , median NIHSS on admission of 13 and median discharge mRS of 4. NVT was statistically different in those with poor outcome (Table 1) and a strong predictor of poor outcome when NVT was greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup> (OR=6 , 95%CI: 1.05-34, p=0.044). TTP was statistically different in patients that achieved and did not achieve GCO (Table 1; OR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.95- 1, p=0.037). There was no statistical correlation between penumbra area, percentage penumbra, and CPM with GCO in univariate analysis. Younger age and lower admission NIHSS were associated with GCO and higher NIHSS was associated with PCO. Using multivariate logistic regression controlling for age and admission NIHSS, none of the CTP parameters were statistically associated with outcome measures. Conclusion(s): CTP parameters derived from commercially available software and published thresholds do not provide useful value beyond the NIHSS for predicting good outcome for AIS patients treated with IV tPA within 3 hours of onset but may be useful in predicting poor outcome if the area of non-viable tissue is greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup>.

We investigated the plasma levels of tumor-specific cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in 17 stage I-II (early) and IV (advanced) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent radiotherapy. Digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and targeted sequencing showed that total and tumor-specific cfDNA levels increased in response to radiotherapy in both early- and advanced-stage NSCLC patients. We detected high copy numbers of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (L858R and T790M) in the cfDNA samples from stage IV NSCLC patients who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy to treat brain metastasis related to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment failure. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that radiotherapy increases tumoral cfDNA levels in the plasma and shows potential to serve as an indicator for diagnosing drug-resistant tumor-related gene mutations in early-stage NSCLC patients or those undergoing molecular targeted therapy.

STUDY DESIGN: Description of a navigated, single-step, minimally invasive technique for the placement of pedicle screws.OBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique for minimally invasive placement of pedicle screws in the lumbar spine using O-arm and StealthStation navigation in combination.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive surgical techniques are described in the literature as safe and effective methods for pedicle screw instrumentation. These techniques increase radiation exposure and prompt multiple instrument passes through the pedicle.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 35 adult patients (187 screws) underwent lumbar surgery with pedicle screw placement using the 1- (8 patients/48 screws) or 2-step (27 patients/139 screws) technique. Complications associated with instrumentation were noted. Pedicle screw position was evaluated.RESULTS: Of 187 screws placed, 181 (96.8%) were found to be fully contained within the pedicle (grade 1) and 4 (2.1%) had a breach of <2 mm. In the 1-step technique, no screws were malpositioned. One screw at S1 with inadequate fixation was replaced with a screw 1 mm larger in diameter. In the 2-step technique, 2 screws (1.06% overall) were revised due to inferior breach of the pedicle. No neurological sequelae were noted. Also, 1 screw was deemed too long at S1 and was replaced with a shorter screw. None of the revised pedicle screws caused neuromonitoring changes and the breaches were found intraoperatively on 3D imaging.CONCLUSIONS: Using O-arm and StealthStation navigation with minimally invasive surgical technology for placement of posterior spinal instrumentation is safe, effective, and limits radiation exposure.",Excluded

3531,"Influence of backscatter radiation on cranial reconstruction implants. Objective: We aimed to evaluate backscatter dose variations in different cranial bone implant materials in an experimental model designed to simulate postoperative radiotherapy. Method(s): We assessed the radiation backscatter doses associated with sheet- and mesh-type titanium plates and hydroxyapatite (HAP) samples (porosity: 35%, 50% and 85%). The samples were irradiated with 6- and 10-MV photon beams from a linear accelerator. Measurements were obtained using an ionization chamber and radiochromic films cut from the same batch. Result(s): At 6MV, the titanium sheet showed the highest peak for backscattered radiation, followed by (in decreasing order) HAP30%, HAP50%, titanium mesh and HAP85%. At 10MV, HAP30% showed the highest peak, followed by HAP50%, titanium sheet, titanium mesh and HAP85%. The peaks were at different depths in the titanium and HAP samples. The thickness of the human scalp is approximately 7mm; therefore, measurements were obtained 0-7mm above the implants to assess the likely dose on the scalp. A comparison of the maximum dose on the scalp showed the titanium sheet had the highest dose at both 6 and 10MV. Conclusion(s): The backscatter dose differed with the density of the material and the backscatter depth was different for each material. Advances in knowledge: Ulcer formation due to radiotherapy after brain tumour depends on not only radiation but also the implant material. Therefore, the density and type of implant material should be considered when planning radiotherapy and selecting bone reconstruction materials. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party. In patients with non-metastatic but inoperable non-small cell lung cancer that is locally too extensive for radical radiotherapy (RT), but who have good performance status, it is important to determine whether thoracic RT should be the minimum that is required to palliate thoracic symptoms or whether treatment should be more intensive, with the aim of prolonging survival. A total of 509 such patients from 11 centres in the UK between November 1989 and October 1992 were admitted to a trial comparing palliative versus more intensive RT with respect to survival and quality of life. They were allocated at random to receive thoracic RT with either 17 Gy in two fractions (F2) 1 week apart (255 patients) or 39 Gy in 13 fractions (F13) 5 days per week (254 patients). Survival was better in the F13 group, the median survival periods being 7 months in the F2 group compared with 9 months in the F13 group, and the survival rates 31% and 36% at one year and 9% and 12% at 2 years, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% CI0.69-0.99). There was a suggestion of a trend towards greater benefit in fitter patients. Metastases appeared earlier in the F2 group. As recorded by patients using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the commonest symptoms on admission were cough, shortness of breath, tiredness, lack of energy, worrying and chest pain. These were more rapidly palliated by the F2 regimen. Psychological distress was generally lower in the F13 group. Three patients (two F13, one F2) exhibited evidence of myelopathy. As recorded by patients using a diary card, 76% of the F2 compared with 81% of the F13 patients had dysphagia associated with their RT. This was transient, lasting for a median of 6.5 days in the F2 group compared with 14 days in the F13 group. In conclusion, the F2 regimen had a more rapid palliative effect.

The prescribed dose was 36 Gy/6 fr, and it was delivered to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV). The plans were evaluated for the dose conformity using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and Paddick conformity indices (RCI and PCI), fall-off (Paddick gradient index [PGI]), and the normal brain dose. The median (range) RCI, PCI, and PGI was 0.94 (0.92 to 0.99), 0.89 (0.77 to 0.94), and 3.75 (2.24 to 6.54) for the 4-arc plan and 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98), 0.89 (0.76 to 0.94), and 3.65 (2.24 to 6.5) for the 6-arc plan, respectively. The median (range) of the normal brain dose was 910.3 cGy (381.4 to 1268.9) for the 4-arc plan and 898.8 cGy (377 to 1252.9) for the 6-arc plan. The PGI of the 6-arc plan was significantly superior to that of the 4-arc plan (p = 0.0076), and the optimal cutoff values for the tumor number and volume indicative of 6-arc (and not 4-arc) VMA-SRT were cases with >= 5 metastases and a PTV of >= 12.9 mL, respectively. The PCI values, however, showed no significant difference between the 2 plans. We believe these results will help in considering the use of 6-arc VMA-SRT for multiple brain metastases.

Both lesions were suggested to be radiation necroses by positron emission tomography using amino acids as a tracer. Neither patient responded to corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or vitamin E. They underwent treatment with 5 mg/kg bevacizumab biweekly, for a total of 6 cycles. The size of the perifocal edema was clearly reduced in response to the treatments. The neurological status of the patients improved concomitant with therapy. However, the clinical status of both patients was aggravated several months after the bevacizumab was stopped, and the perifocal edemas enlarged again. The patients underwent a second treatment with bevacizumab, and the perifocal edemas again decreased. Although radiation necrosis may recur several months after bevacizumab treatment, repeated bevacizumab treatments also appear to be effective.",Excluded

858,"Dose reduction to radiosensitive tissues in CT. Do commercially available shields meet the users' needs?. AIM: To assess the effectiveness and economy of routinely using commercially available in-plane bismuth shielding during CT scanning of the chest and brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty patients were scanned with thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs) in situ to measure the radiation dose to the thyroid and eye during CT scanning of the brain and chest. Half of the patients had the ""AttenuRad"" shield in place during scanning.RESULTS: Use of the shielding reduced the mean dose to the eye from 6.0 +/- 0.3 mGy to 4.9 mGy +/- 0.2 mGy and the thyroid dose from 16.4 mGy +/- 1.2 mGy to 7.1 mGy +/- 0.5 mGy.CONCLUSION: Use of the thyroid shield is recommended for all CT scanning of the chest. The eye shield does not produce as marked a reduction in radiation dose to the lens of the eye, when an angled gantry is used, since the eyes are not in the primary beam. Use of the eyeshield is justifiable where irradiation of the orbit is unavoidable, although whether artifacts would be a problem if the shield was used in this way was not assessed.",Excluded

Minibeam radiation therapy (MBRT) is a type of spatial fractionated radiotherapy that uses submillimetric beams. This work reports on a pilot study on normal tissue response and the increase of the lifespan of glioma-bearing rats when irradiated with a tabletop x-ray system. Our results show a significant widening of the therapeutic window for brain tumours treated with MBRT: an important proportion of long-term survivals (60%) coupled with a significant reduction of toxicity when compared with conventional (broad beam) irradiations. In addition, the clinical translation of the minibeam treatment at a conventional irradiator is evaluated through a possible human head treatment plan. Copyright © 2021",Excluded
3285,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation improves naming in Alzheimer disease patients at different stages of cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: Word-finding difficulty (anomia) is commonly observed in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The aim of this study was to assess the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) on picture naming in 24 probable AD patients with different degrees of cognitive decline.METHODS: High-frequency rTMS was applied to the left and right dlPFC during object and action naming in AD patients. A sham stimulation was used as a control condition.RESULTS: Whilst, as previously reported, stimulation to both the left and the right dlPFC improved action, but not object naming in the mild AD group; an improved naming accuracy for both classes of stimuli was found in the moderate to severe group.CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the dlPFC improves naming performance also in the advanced stages of AD. Moreover, in the severe group the effect is not specific for action naming, as in the case of the mild AD group. These findings suggest that rTMS can affect the intrinsic ability of the brain to restore or compensate for damaged function and may represent an useful new tool for cognitive rehabilitation.",Excluded
3010,"Endovascular treatment using low-power ultraviolet laser for delayed vasospasm in the rabbit carotid artery model. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously reported that pretreatment with external ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 325 nm before blood exposure prevented the development of chronic vasospasm in rabbit common carotid arteries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of endovascular UV light on vasospasm after blood immersion by using the same animal model.METHODS: The right common carotid arteries in 63 rabbits were enclosed in silicon cuffs on day 0. Sheaths were empty or filled with clotted blood. Thirty minutes after the placement of the sheaths, either alone or with blood, the common carotid arteries were subjected to UV or visible light (442 nm) irradiation via an endovascular approach at a fluence rate of 0.17 W/cm(2). The animals were killed on day 2, 9, or 30. Digital subtraction angiography was performed on days 0 and 2 and at the end point to evaluate the degree of vasospasm.RESULTS: UV treatment significantly prevented the development of vasospasm on day 2. On days 9 and 30, there were no significant differences between UV-treated animals and control animals. The preventive effect reached an approximate plateau with an irradiation time of 10 s. No severe vascular injury, such as perforation, occurred in response to UV treatment during the observation period. UV light was significantly more effective than visible light in preventing vasospasm (P <.001).CONCLUSION: These results suggest that endovascular UV irradiation after blood exposure has a prophylactic effect on vasospasm and suggest a dependence on irradiation wavelength and duration of irradiation.",Excluded
1991,"Effects of oxotremorine on synthesis of acetylcholine in striatum and whole brain of mice killed by various techniques. Levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and choline (Ch) and turnover of ACh have been studied in whole brain and striatum of mice by mass fragmentography, employing either spinal dislocation or microwave irradiation to kill the animals. Oxotremorine (OT) was found to increase levels of ACh and Ch both in whole brain and striatum regardless of the way of killing. In whole brain, turnover of ACh was decreased after OT independently of the way of killing, but in striatum a decrease was observed only if microwave irradiation was used, which is in contrast to previous findings. The discrepancy between whole brain and striatum may be explained by the preserving effect of microwave irradiation on a very fast turning-over pool of ACh in striatum.",Excluded
2435,"Activation of ATM and phosphorylation of p53 by heat shock. p53 protein is phosphorylated in response to various stresses. Here we examined phosphorylation of p53 protein in normal human diploid cells after heat shock at 43 degrees C for 2 h. We found that heat shock stimulates phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 but not at Ser20, while X-irradiation at 4 Gy and 10 J/m(2) of UV induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and less significantly at Ser20. Increased phosphorylation of Ser15 was also observed in heat shocked GM638, the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line. Although X-ray irradiation induced phosphorylation of Ser6, 9, 20, and 37 in GM638 cells, heat shock did not affect the phosphorylation level of these serines. We observed little or no phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in two primary ataxia telangiectasia fibroblast cells, that are defective in ATM. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that immunoprecipitated ATM from both heat-shocked and X-irradiated normal human diploid cells can phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 to a similar extent. These results indicate that heat shock induces phosphorylation of p53, especially at Ser15, and its phosphorylation is mediated by ATM kinase.",Excluded
3427,"Neuro-oncological diagnosis in patients without histological confirmation. The impossibility to conduct a histological diagnosis could be due to different reasons: (1) patient's refusal to undergo surgery/biopsy. (2) Technical difficulties: despite the advance in surgical procedures, the removal of lesions that are located either in critical or in deep areas represents a considerable risk for patients. (3) Quality/quantity of the sample. In rare cases even when the surgical sample is achieved it could be impossible to reach a histological confirmation, for example due to the small amount of tissue obtained. The lack of histology leads to suboptimal therapy, incorrect prognosis, and misinterpretation of clinical trials and furthermore undermines the possibility to perform most radiation and chemotherapy protocols.

791,"Acid-induced unfolding of brain-derived neurotrophic factor results in the formation of a monomeric ""a state"". Recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor in acid undergoes a slow loss of tertiary structure as monitored by both near-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence, and appears to retain some secondary structure, as monitored by far-UV circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This loss of tertiary structure parallels a decrease in the weight average molecular weight, from dimer to monomer, when examined using light scattering. Increasing the temperature accelerates this slow reaction. This process may be described most simply as N2 in equilibrium with 2D where N and D are the native and denatured forms of the protein, respectively. However, the acid denaturation strongly depends on the protein concentration, with higher concentration resulting in a lower rate and extent of denaturation. This suggests that the more complicated mechanism N2 in equilibrium with 2N in equilibrium with 2D more accurately describes the denaturation, where the dissociation into a native monomer is the rate-limiting step, and the conversion of N to D occurs relatively rapidly. Size-exclusion chromatography (at neutral pH) at several points during denaturation further demonstrated that the amount of tertiary structure remaining paralleled the dimer concentration and also that the monomer form was long-lived, remaining as monomer during the course of the chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity determination indicated that the acid-denatured form is a compact molecule. On the basis of the above data, the acid-denatured form may be considered to be a monomeric compact intermediate A state with no tertiary structure but considerable secondary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

The VCVAC consists of 4 different charts (1-4). The contrast is 90% in charts 1 and 4, 15% in chart 2 and 2.5% in chart 3. Chart 4 is the reverse polarity of chart 1. The decrease of visual acuity compared with the high-contrast chart (chart 1) was larger in the cataract group with both in the 15% contrast (0.52 vs. 0.71 octave) and the 2.5% contrast (1.21 vs. 1.75 octaves). In cataract group, 23/40 eyes (57.5%) showed better visual acuity with chart 4 than that of chart 1.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to various tissues. There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage.

OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to examine the pineal gland of rats exposed to constant light and darkness at light and electron microscopic level.DESIGN: For this purpose 18 male Wistar rats were used. Animals were divided into three groups. Rats in group I (Control) were kept under 12 hrs light: 12 hrs dark conditions. Rats in group II were exposed to constant darkness, while rats in group III were exposed to constant light for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, all animals were killed by decapitation. The pineal glands of rats were removed, then processed for light and electron microscopy.RESULTS: In our study, extensive number of pinealocytes was observed in the structure of pineal gland of rats exposed to constant darkness and some of the observed pinealocytes were determined to contain double nucleoli. Furthermore, mitochondria and lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of pinealocytes were increased and rough endoplasmic reticulum sacs were enlarged in this group. Whereas, in rats those exposed to the constant light, a decrease in pinealocyte intensity was associated with increase in the connective tissue between parenchymal cells. Additionally, mitochondria and lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of cells were decreased.CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that the pinealocyte cell activity of rats exposed to constant darkness was increased but decreased in rats exposed to constant light.",Excluded

2194,"Combining low-dose whole brain radiation with radioimmunotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma. Purpose/Objective(s): Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B-cell disorder that initially responds well to therapy, but a majority of patients relapse within 2 years. High-dose whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was once the primary treatment, but eventual relapses and late neurocognitive sequelae were frequently observed. The addition of CNS-directed chemotherapy to WBRT improved duration of response, with a concomitant increase in neurocognitive problems. More recently, medical oncologists have attempted to avoid radiation altogether, with similar clinical responses as seen with WBRT alone. The addition of rituximab has yielded little improvement due to the poor efficiency (<1%) of the antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). WBRT has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB permeability to macromolecules for several hours.We hypothesized that adjuvant low-dose WBRT followed by anti-CD20-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT) may allow for specific dose escalation to areas of tumor cells while avoiding extra dose to uninvolved areas of the brain, decreasing the chance for significant neurocognitive deficits. Materials/Methods: Four patients (71F, 69M, 48F, 53M) with PCNSL (3 relapsed, 1 newly diagnosed) were treated with low-dose (18 Gy in 10 fractions) WBRT,with 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan RIT given immediately after the final WBRT fraction. None of the patients had previously received radiation therapy.Median RIT dosewas 24.5 (21.8-32) mCi. All patients were restaged with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain at 3 months, and every 3 months following. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, neurocognition was tested and family members were asked about subjective changes. Result(s): All four patients obtained a complete response to chemotherapy + low-dose WBRT + RIT. After a median follow-up of 17.5 (12-20) months, no relapses have been observed. No decline in neurocognitive function (objective or subjective) has been seen; in fact, improvement was seen in 3 patients. All patients tolerated the regimen well, with the typical transient decline and recovery of blood counts seen with RIT. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant low-dose WBRT and RIT following CNS-directed chemotherapy appears to be safe in this small sample. Complete responses were seen in all patients, and this appears to be durable compared to standard PCNSL salvage therapies. No neurocognitive deficits were seen following this novel radiation therapy regimen. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",Excluded

1458,"Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms. Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm<sup>3</sup>. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1248,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy using tomotherapy for single or multiple vertebral metastases. Purpose/Objective(s): Conventional radiation therapy has been used to treat vertebral metastases (VM), but because of the dose constraint to the spinal cord, high enough doses to obtain long-term remission cannot necessarily be delivered. By using tomotherapy, the spinal cord dose can be lowered and higher doses can be delivered to VM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for single or multiple VM using tomotherapy. Materials/Methods: Between October 2010 and January 2012, 27 patients (primary cancer: gastrointestinal 6, urethral 5, prostate 5, lung 5, breast 3, others 3) with 32 VM (location: cervical 3, thoracic 18, lumber 11) were treated with SBRT as initial radiation therapy. All patients treated on this protocol had WHO performance status 0-2 and could keep position on an immobilization device for > 20 minutes. Before SBRT, 2- mm-thick CT and MR images were obtained and the tumor and neighboring vertebral structures were contoured as the clinical target volume (CTV). The planning target volume was CTV plus 5 mm. Either 40 Gy in 8 fractions or 48 Gy in 16 fractions were prescribed depending on Katagiri's prognostic index. The radiation dose to the spinal cord and other risk organs were reduced to the tolerance levels using intensity modulation. One to 4 lesions in consecutive vertebrae were treated in one course of SBRT. Radiological (CT and/or MRI) and physical examinations were performed at 1-3 month intervals after SBRT. Birthel index (BI), numerical rating scale (NRS) and the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria ver 4.0 were used to evaluate activities of daily living (ADL), pain and toxicity. Result(s): Treatment times were within 15-20 minutes. A median followup period was 5 months (range, 1-14). Compared to pretreatment status, the majority of VM patients (29/32) had prompt pain relief within 4 weeks after SBRT. The NRS significantly dropped at 1 month after SBRT (4.0 +/- 0.8 [SE] vs. 1.0 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) and the effect continued over 2 months. Significant BI decrease was not observed at 2 months after SBRT (84 +/- 16 vs. 86 +/- 18, p = 0.7). BI decrease resulting from VM enlargement was observed in only 2 patients. They occurred during SBRT course and 9 months after SBRT, respectively. One Grade 3 dermatitis developed at 3 months after SBRT. One patient had Grade 2 ileus and 2 had Grade 1 neuralgia, although direct association with SBRT was not clear. No pneumonitis was observed in 18 patients with thoracic VM. No grade > 2 neurologic toxicity resulting from SBRT was observed. Conclusion(s): This is the first report on successful SBRT for bone metastases in up to 4 consecutive vertebrae using tomotherapy. Good ADL control and palliation of pain were achieved with acceptable toxicity by SBRT using tomotherapy.",Excluded

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective examination of 37 patients with metastatic spinal tumors treated with intraoperative radiation therapy.OBJECTIVE: To propose a new technique for local control of metastatic spinal tumors.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No reports of intraoperative radiation therapy for metastatic spinal tumors have been published as of the time of this writing.METHODS: Between December 1992 and April 1996, intraoperative radiation therapy was performed in 37 patients with spinal metastasis. In all but one patient, the spinal cord was protected during intraoperative radiation therapy by a lead shield to prevent radiation myelopathy. In addition to intraoperative radiation therapy, 22 of the 37 patients received external radiation therapy, either before or after their operation. Although the authors had recommended a dose of approximately 30 Gy of external radiation therapy after wound suture removal to patients who did not receive preoperative radiation therapy, the remaining 15 patients did not receive external radiation therapy, either by choice or because they received alternative therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for various cancers was administered to 9 of the 37 patients, including 4 of the aforementioned 15.RESULTS: All patients attained clinical improvement in pain, neurologic function status, or both, with no evidence of local recurrence. Radiation myelopathy developed in the one patient whose spinal cord was not protected during intraoperative radiation therapy. Eleven patients experienced metastasis in vertebrae that were not surgically treated.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative radiation therapy appears to achieve good palliation and may be useful for local control of spinal metastases.",Excluded

2799,"Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes From Repeat Whole-brain Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases in the Age of Stereotactic Radiosurgery. OBJECTIVES: Repeating whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with progressive/recurrent brain metastases is controversial. We retrospectively reviewed our experience of repeat WBRT in an era where stereotactic radiosurgery was also available.METHODS: In our IRB-approved database, 49 patients received repeat WBRT from 1996 to 2011. Median initial dose of WBRT was 30 Gy in 10 fractions (range, 27 to 37.5 Gy); median reirradiation dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions (range, 14 to 30 Gy). Median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) at reirradiation was 70 (range, 40 to 90). Median number of discrete lesions at reirradiation was 6 (range, 1 to 30). Median interval between initial diagnosis of brain metastases and relapse requiring repeat WBRT was 11.5 months (range, 1.5 to 49.2 mo). Overall survival and relapse-free survival were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare outcomes between groups.RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients completed repeat WBRT. Median survival after repeat WBRT was 3 months (95% CI, 1.9-4.0). Thirteen patients had improved neurological symptoms (27%), 12 were stable (24%), and 14 had worsening symptoms (29%). On radiographic follow-up of 22 patients, 10 (46%) were improved, 4 (18%) were stable, and 8 (36%) progressed. Improved neurological symptoms after repeat WBRT and higher KPS at first follow-up were associated with improved survival (P=0.05 and 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Repeat WBRT was well tolerated. Modest survival times are seen. Prognostic factors for survival include improved neurological symptoms after repeat WBRT and higher KPS at first follow-up. Repeat WBRT may be useful to improve neurological symptoms in patients with limited treatment options, especially those who are not appropriate stereotactic radiosurgery candidates.",Excluded

Compound (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT possesses high binding potency and selectivity towards VAChT (K<inf>i-VAChT</inf> = 0.59 nM, K<inf>i-sigma1, sigma2</inf> > 10,000 nM). Here we report the radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT in rodent and nonhuman primates. Methods (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized by a two-step alkylation of the phenol precursor. Biodistribution studies were performed in male SD rats at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min post injection. MicroPET studies were performed in male cynomolgus monkeys (4-6 Kg) using a microPET Focus 220 scanner. Dosimetry studies were performed in one female and two male monkeys. Results (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized in high specific activity (>2 Ci/mumol, EOB) and a yield of 30-45% (decay corrected). Biodistribution studies revealed that (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT specifically accumulates in VAChT-enriched striatum area: at 60 min, the uptake(s) (ID%/g) in striatum, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum are 0.82, 0.43, 0.42, 0.45 and 0.29 repectively. No significant defluorination was observed. The uptake in striatum versus cerebellum reached 2.8-fold at 60 min post-injection. MicroPET brain imaging studies in nonhuman primates revealed that the striatum has the highest uptake and displayed clear striatum-to-cerebellum contrast (2.6-fold ratio). Dosimetry studies suggested that injection of 20 mCi into humans will not exceed allowable radiation exposure.

The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of radiosurgery (RS) in the treatment of brain cavernomas. The series included intra-axial 17 lesions in 15 patients, 10 women and 5 men. Eleven were infratentorial lesions (brain stem and cerebellum) and 6 supratentorial (thalamus, hippocampus, brain cortex and paraventricular region). Fifteen lesions bled once or twice. Two lesions revealed by focal epilepsy displayed a rim of hemosiderin on MRI. RS was performed for all 17 lesions. The risk of morbidity was considered too high for surgery in 13 patients and 2 patients wished to be treated by RS. RS was delivered by a 6 MeV linear accelerator with a conic collimators device. Stereotactic localization and dosimetry were carried out with STP system 3.O (Fischer-Liebinger TM, Germany). Doses ranged between 16 and 23 Gy, the lower doses being delivered to brain stem lesions. All the lesions received a single fraction isocentric radiation. Lesion volumes ranged between 0.7 and 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup>. Twelve lesions disappeared on MRI, the volume reduced (50-80%) in 3 lesions, and did not change in 2 lesions. Volume reduction was significant (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). In the follow up, 4 patients experienced bleeding, 1 of them died. Edema diagnosed in 2 patients at 3 and 13 months was treated by corticosteroids. The risk of hemorrhage without treatment in this group of patients was estimated about 34.45% a year. Hemorrhage incidence observed after RS was 7.17% (significant with P < 0.01, P < 0.001). At the end of follow up, 12 patients were symptom-free, 2 had sequels from bleeding, 1 patient died. Radiosurgery is an efficient treatment of cavernomas leading to a total disappearance of 70% of the lesions and significantly reducing the risk of new hemorrhages. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1383,"Inhibition of nerve conduction by electromagnetic induction of the frog sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation. The effect of electromagnetic induction (EMI) on impulse conduction and muscle contraction was studied in isolated sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation of the frog. Electrical stimulation (ES) of the sciatic nerve, at 0.5 Hz with 0.6 V (supramaximal) and 1-ms pulse duration, produced twitch contractions (3.5 +/- 0.4 g tension, mean +/- S.E., n = 8 frogs), which were reduced or blocked by EMI, applied to the nerve via an induction coil, from a d.c. source of 1.5-4 V, at a frequency of 100 min-1, for 2- to 4-min duration. Recovery of the blocked twitches was obtained within 4-5 min, after the cessation of the EMI and washing out the preparation in Ringer solution. The inhibition of the twitch tension by EMI was compared to that produced by an effective concentration of a local anaesthetic, lignocaine (1 microM), which is known to block conduction, by blocking ionic fluxes across the nerve membrane. It is possible that EMI also interferes with the ionic fluxes, and in prolonged duration, may produce changes in the myelin sheath (or the Schwann cells) of the nerve membrane. A comparison of ES with EMI was made, and it was concluded that EMI inhibited electrically induced neuromuscular transmission at the frog neuromuscular junction.",Excluded
1662,"Hypofractionated radiation therapy and temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma and poor prognostic factors. A prospective, single-institution experience. BACKGROUND: Hypofractionated radiation therapy is a feasible and safe treatment option in elderly and frail patients with glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hypofractionated radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide in terms of feasibility and disease control in primary glioblastoma patients with poor prognostic factors other than advanced age, such as post-surgical neurological complications, high tumor burden, unresectable or multifocal lesions, and potential low treatment compliance due to social factors or rapidly progressive disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: GTV included the surgical cavity plus disease visible in T1WI-MRI, FLAIR-MRI and in the MET-uptake. The CTV was defined as the GTV plus 1.5-2 cm margin; the PTV was the CTV+0.3 cm margin. Forty, fourty-five, and fifty grays in 15 fractions were prescribed to 95% of PTV, CTV, and GTV, respectively. Treatment was delivered using IMRT or the VMAT technique. Simultaneously, 75 mg/m2/day of temozolomide were administered.RESULTS: Between January 2010 and November 2017, we treated a total of 17 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 68-years; median KPS was 50-70%. MGMT-methylation status was negative in 5 patients, and 8 patients were IDH-wildtype. Eight of 18 patients were younger than 65-years. Median tumor volume was 26.95cc; median PTV volume was 322cc. Four lesions were unresectable; 6 patients underwent complete surgical resection. Median residual volume was 1.14cc. Progression-free survival was 60% at 6 months, 33% at 1-year and 13% at 2-years (median OS = 7 months). No acute grade 3-5 toxicities were documented. Symptomatic grade 3 radiation necrosis was observed in one patient.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poor clinical factors other than advanced age can be selected for hypofractionated radiotherapy. The OS and PFS rates obtained in our series are similar to those in patients treated with standard fractionation, assuring good treatment adherence, low rates of toxicity and probable improved cost-effectiveness.",Excluded

To specifically separate perception mediated by these pathways we have used low-contrast Gaussian filtered black-white or coloured visual stimuli. By use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the visual cortex inhibition of magnocellular stimuli was achieved distinctly earlier by about 40 ms compared with parvocellular information. A nonspecific inhibition of all stimuli could be seen peaking at 75-90 ms, significantly higher for magnocellular stimuli. The particular vulnerability of magnocellular stimuli to TMS is correlated with distinct physiological properties of this pathway such as faster conduction velocity and non-linear stimulus encoding.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for central nervous system disease commonly involves collaboration between Radiation Oncology and Neurosurgery. We describe our early experience with a multidisciplinary clinic model.METHODS: In 2016, the novel RADIANS (RADIation oncology And NeuroSurgery) clinic model was initiated at a community hospital. Disease and treatment demographics were collected and analyzed. Patient satisfaction was assessed via a blinded survey questionnaire.RESULTS: Forty-two patients have been seen since the inception of RADIANS. The median age was 65; and the median patient distance from RADIANS was 42.7 miles (mean = 62.6; range = 0.7-285). Half of the patients traveled >50 miles to receive care, and >80% were seen for central nervous system metastases. Of the patients receiving radiation, 75% received stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy. The mean overall satisfaction from 0 (not satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) was 4.8.CONCLUSIONS: The RADIANS clinic model has proved viable and well-liked by patients in a community setting, with the majority of radiation therapy administered being stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy rather than conventional fractionation.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Microwave radiation exposure from cellular telephone use has been implicated in the development of intracranial tumors. The intratemporal facial nerve (IFN) is exposed to higher levels of cellular telephone radiation than intracranial tissues. The purpose of the study was to determine whether cellular telephone use is associated with an increased risk of IFN tumors.STUDY DESIGN: Case-control using a structured telephone survey at an academic, tertiary-care referral center.METHODS: Patients with IFN tumors (n = 18) were case-matched with patients treated for acoustic neuroma (n = 51), rhinosinusitis (n = 72), and dysphonia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 69). Risk of facial nerve tumorigenesis was compared by extent of cellular telephone use and other risk factors.RESULTS: The odds ratio of developing an IFN tumor was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2-1.9) with any handheld cellular telephone use and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.1-2.1) with regular cellular telephone use. No factors were associated with an increased risk for IFN tumor development.CONCLUSIONS: Regular cellular telephone use does not appear to be associated with a higher risk of IFN tumor development. The short duration of widespread cellular telephone use precludes definite exclusion as a risk for IFN tumor development.",Excluded
2160,"Opposite effects of tetanic stimulation of the auditory thalamus or auditory cortex on the acoustic startle reflex in awake rats. The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle. The lateral amygdala nucleus (LA) receives auditory inputs from both the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus; MGN) and auditory association cortex (AAC), and is critical for auditory fear conditioning. The central amygdala nucleus, which has intra-amygdaloid connections with LA, enhances startle magnitude via midbrain connections to the startle circuits. Tetanic stimulation of either MGN or AAC in vitro or in vivo can induce long-term potentiation in LA. In the present study, behavioural consequences of tetanization of these auditory afferents were investigated in awake rats. The acoustic startle reflex of rats was enhanced by tetanic stimulation of MGN, but suppressed by that of AAC. All the tetanization-induced changes of startle diminished within 24 h. Blockade of GABAB receptors in the LA area reversed the suppressive effect of tetanic stimulation of AAC on startle but did not change the enhancing effect of tetanic stimulation of MGN. Moreover, transient electrical stimulation of MGN enhanced the acoustic startle reflex when it lagged behind acoustic stimulation, but inhibited the acoustic startle reflex when it preceded acoustic stimulation. The results of the present study indicate that MGN and AAC afferents to LA play different roles in emotional modulation of startle, and AAC afferents are more influenced by inhibitory GABAB transmission in LA.",Excluded

The anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody ipilimumab has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic non-CNS melanoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CTLA-4 inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic melanoma with limited brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Between January 2008 and June 2011, 58 patients with limited brain metastases from melanoma were treated with SRS with a median dose of 20 Gy delivered to the 50% isodose line (range, 15-20 Gy). In 25 patients, ipilimumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 90 min every 3 weeks for a median of four doses (range, 1-8). Local control (LC), freedom from new brain metastases, and overall survival (OS) were assessed from the date of the SRS procedure. The median LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS for the entire group were 8.7, 4.3, and 5.9 months, respectively. The cause of death was CNS progression in all but eight patients. Six-month LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS were 65, 35, and 56%, respectively, for those who received ipilimumab and 63, 47, and 46% for those who did not (P=NS).

1848,"Defining survival for patients with breast cancer with brain metastases. Background: Brain metastases account for 100,000 to 170,000 cases per year in the U.S, the bulk being from breast and lung primaries. About 10-15% of breast cancer patients develop brain metastases and historically, their survival has been poor. Introduction of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents and newer radiation techniques in the past decade has led to better control of systemic disease raising the possibility of increasing incidence of brain metastases as well as better control of CNS disease. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases in our practice in the last 10 years. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart analysis and we analyzed the charts of 18 patients with breast cancer who had developed brain metastases. The parameters analyzed included patient age at diagnosis of breast cancer and at development of brain metastases, receptor status and various treatment modalities used to control local as well as Metastatic disease. Result(s): The median survival time after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and the number of brain metastases was 55 months. The time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age and number of brain metastases. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significant with a p-value of 0.007 and the number of brain metastases was not significant with a p-value of 0.55. Using the Log Rank test, median survival for Her2neu positive patients was 71 months and for Her2neu negative patients was 58 months with a non-significant p value of 0.86. Review of treatment modalities revealed that six patients underwent surgical removal of metastases and 12 patients received WBRT. Average number of systemic treatments used was 6.7 including chemotherapeutic, biological and hormonal agents. Conclusion(s): In our practice, the overall survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases was found to be 55 months after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and number of brain metastases. Overall survival did not vary significantly with the number of brain metastases and Her2neu receptor status.",Excluded
2048,"The human CSB (ERCC6) gene corrects the transcription-coupled repair defect in the CHO cell mutant UV61. The human CSB gene, mutated in Cockayne's syndrome group B (partially defective in both repair and transcription) was previously cloned by virtue of its ability to correct the moderate UV sensitivity of the CHO mutant UV61. To determine whether the defect in UV61 is the hamster equivalent of Cockayne's syndrome, the RNA polymerase II transcription and DNA repair characteristics of a repair-proficient CHO cell line (AA8), UV61 and a CSB transfectant of UV61 were compared. In each cell line, formation and removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were measured in the individual strands of the actively transcribed DHFR gene and in a transcriptionally inactive region downstream of DHFR. AA8 cells efficiently remove CPDs from the transcribed strand, but not from either the non-transcribed strand or the inactive region. There was no detectable repair of CPDs in any region of the genome in UV61. Transfection of the human CSB gene into UV61 restores the normal repair pattern (CPD removal in only the transcribed strand), demonstrating that the DNA repair defect in UV61 is homologous to that in Cockayne's syndrome (complementation group B) cells. However, we observe no significant deficiency in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in UV61, suggesting that the CSB protein has independent roles in DNA repair and RNA transcription pathways.",Excluded
808,"Predicting image registration quality from the shape of the similarity metric: Potential for machine learning approaches. Purpose: Typically, image guided radiotherapy relies on rigid body (RB) image registration (IR) between a reference and localisation image. Automated IR algorithms based on iterative optimisation of a similarity metric (SM) between two images are used extensively and improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process. Occasionally these algorithms do not locate the global optimum of the SM which, if undetected, could lead to a geometric treatment error. This feasibility study uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that the location of the 'found' optimum was acceptably close to the global optimum based on measures of the SM hyper-surface. Materials: Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study. The global optimum RB transform for each image pair was located by applying random misalignments before IR and calculating the average rigid body transform returned by the algorithm. A measure of target registration error (TRE) was calculated for each registration from the residual RB transform. IRs were classified as 'Good' (TRE < 0.6mm), 'OK' (0.6<TRE<2.5mm) or 'Poor' (TRE>2.5mm). The correlation ratio SM was calculated along the six cardinal axis of the RB transform space at intervals of 0.2mm. The shape of the SM was characterised by seven different measures describing minimum SM, accuracy and distinctiveness of optimum. These measures were used to train and test a Bayesian Network using K-fold cross validation. The machine learning process was repeated using just 25 points; the 'found' optimum and two points either siDe of the location of the 'found' optimum on the six cardinal axes of the RB transform.Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study.

However, the Bayesian Network was able to correctly classify 84% of IRs based on the detailed similarity metric profiles. No 'Poor' IRs were classified as 'Good' and vice-versa. Almost identical results were achieved with the 25 point measures but one out of 449 IRs were classified as 'Good' when actually 'Poor'. Conclusion(s): This demonstrates the potential for machine learning based on the local shape of the SM hyper-surface to check likelihood of IR accuracy using only a few calculations of the SM. Such methods could be used to reassure radiation technologists when auto-IR is successful and indicate when closer scrutiny and manual adjustment of image alignment is required.",Excluded

AC chemotherapy (3 months) followed by paditaxel plus bevacizumab (4 months) was administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, she underwent mastectomy and lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed a partial response. After surgery, radiotherapy with a radiation dose of 50 Gy was applied to the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph node. Multiple pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymph node metastases were diagnosed 23 months after initial treatment, and she was treated with S-1 administration. Two months after S-1 treatment, the PET-CT showed metastasis in the right atrium. Since there were no cardiac symptoms, S-1 treatment was continued without cardiovascular treatment. However, the mediastinal lymph node metastasis progressed; and therefore, S-1 administration was stopped and chemotherapy with eribulin was initiated. Brain metastasis was diagnosed at the same time and treated with a gamma knife. Although chemotherapy with eribulin was continued, the patient died 33 months after initial treatment owing to the brain metastasis. The cardiac metastasis did not progress during chemotherapy with eribulin. There was no sign of heart failure or arrhythmia during the treatment.

The brain contents of glutathione, malondialdhyde and total nitrate/nitrite were measured to assess the oxidative stress. In order to evaluate the extent of the apoptotic changes in brain, tissue caspase-3 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and the degree of DNA fragmentation was estimated. Moreover, brain tissues were examined using light microscopy to evaluate the histological changes in different groups and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as an indicator for the brain tissue damage.

191,"Robotics in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery: A critical review of existing systems and proposed specifications for new robotic platforms. BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in image guidance, endoscopy, and tube-shaft instruments have allowed for the further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times, reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved longterm outcomes, the technical skills required to perform such surgery are inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques, and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance surgical performance. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the role of surgical robots in keyhole transcranial endoscopeassisted microsurgery. METHOD(S): The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of presently available robotic systems was performed. RESULT(S): Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field. CONCLUSION(S): New robotic platforms in minimally invasive neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant clinical penetration.

BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation exposure promotes sunburn and thereby acute and chronic inflammatory processes, contributing to pain development and maintenance. New therapeutic alternatives are necessary because typical treatments can cause adverse effects. An attractive alternative would be to target the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a calcium-permeable, non-selective cation channel, which is involved in a variety of inflammatory pain models.OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the peripheral participation of TRPA1 using a topical treatment (HC030031 gel formulation; a selective TRPA1 antagonist) in nociception and inflammation caused by a UVB radiation-induced burn model in male mice (25-30 g).METHODS: The mice were anaesthetised, and just the right hind paw was exposed to UVB radiation (0.75 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Topical treatments were applied immediately after irradiation and once a day for 8 days.RESULTS: HC030031 gel presented suitable pH and spreadability factor, ensuring its quality and the therapeutic effect. HC030031 0.05 % reversed UVB-induced mechanical and cold allodynia, with maximum inhibition (I<sub>max</sub>) of 69 +/- 13 % and 100 % (on day 4), respectively. HC030031 0.05 % also reduced the paw edema and MPO activity, with I<sub>max</sub> of 77 +/- 6 % (on day 5) and 69 +/- 28 %, respectively.

Strategies that may prove to be effective in reducing exposure, or the effects of the irradiation, include shielding, administration of drugs or dietary supplements to reduce the radiation effects, crew selection based on a screening of individual radiation sensitivity. It is foreseeable that research in passive and active radiation shielding, radioprotective chemicals, and individual susceptibility will boost in the next years to provide efficient countermeasures to the space radiation threat.",Excluded
2740,"Modification of ultraviolet radiation effects on the membrane of myelinated nerve fibers by sulfhydryl compounds. The modification of the ultraviolet blocking of sodium channels and of the ultraviolet-induced potential shift of the gating parameters by means of the sulfhydryl compounds l-cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol was investigated in the node of Ranvier under voltage-clamp conditions. The UV wavelength was 280 nm. The radiation-induced potential shift of the voltage-dependent gating parameters was prevented or even reversed by the action of the sulfhydryl compounds (internal application), while the blocking effect was not affected. It is concluded that the two radiation effects are caused by two separate photoreactions. Internally applied N-ethylmaleimide, binding specifically to protein-SH groups, exhibits an effect similar to the ultraviolet-induced potential shift, without affecting the maximum sodium permeability. Therefore, the ultraviolet-induced potential shift might be caused by a photocatalyzed oxidation of -SH groups of membrane proteins changing the surface charge density at the inner side of the nodal membrane.",Excluded
2112,"Paternal irradiation perturbs the expression of circadian genes in offspring. The circadian system represents a complex network which influences the timing of many biological processes. Recent studies have established that circadian alterations play an important role in the susceptibility to many human diseases, including cancer. Here we report that paternal irradiation in mice significantly affects the expression of genes involved in rhythmic processes in their first-generation offspring. Using microarrays, the patterns of gene expression were established for brain, kidney, liver and spleen samples from the non-exposed offspring of irradiated CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice. The most over-represented categories among the genes differentially expressed in the offspring of control and irradiated males were those involved in rhythmic process, circadian rhythm and DNA-dependent regulation of transcription. The results of our study therefore provide a plausible explanation for the transgenerational effects of paternal irradiation, including increased transgenerational carcinogenesis described in other studies.",Excluded

The purpose of our study was to determine the frequency and severity of intracerebral hemorrhages and T2 hyperintense white matter lesions (WMLs) following radiation therapy for brain tumors in adult patients. Of 648 adult brain tumor patients who received radiation therapy at our institute, magnetic resonance (MR) image data consisting of a gradient echo (GRE) and FLAIR T2-weighted image were available three and five years after radiation therapy in 81 patients. Intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as a hypointense dot lesion appearing on GRE images after radiation therapy. The number and size of the lesions were evaluated. The T2 hyperintense WMLs observed on the FLAIR sequences were graded according to the extent of the lesion. Intracerebral hemorrhage was detected in 21 (25.9%) and 35 (43.2) patients in the three- and five-year follow-up images, respectively. The number of intracerebral hemorrhages per patient tended to increase as the follow-up period increased, whereas the size of the intracerebral hemorrhages exhibited little variation over the course of follow-up. T2 hyperintense WMLs were observed in 27 (33.3%) and 32 (39.5) patients in the three and five year follow-up images, respectively. The age at the time of radiation therapy was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the patients with T2 hyperintense WMLs than in those without lesions. Intracerebral hemorrhages are not uncommon in adult brain tumor patients undergoing radiation therapy. The incidence and number of intracerebral hemorrhages increased over the course of follow-up. T2 hyperintense WMLs were observed in more than one-third of the study population.",Excluded
2052,"The centrosomal, putative tumor suppressor protein TACC2 is dispensable for normal development, and deficiency does not lead to cancer. TACC2 is a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein family and is associated with the centrosome-spindle apparatus during cell cycling. In vivo, the TACC2 gene is expressed in various splice forms predominantly in postmitotic tissues, including heart, muscle, kidney, and brain. Studies of human breast cancer samples and cell lines suggest a putative role of TACC2 as a tumor suppressor protein. To analyze the physiological role of TACC2, we generated mice lacking TACC2. TACC2-deficient mice are viable, develop normally, are fertile, and lack phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, TACC2 deficiency does not lead to an increased incidence of tumor development. Finally, in TACC2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, proliferation and cell cycle progression as well as centrosome numbers are comparable to those in wild-type cells. Therefore, TACC2 is not required, nonredundantly, for mouse development and normal cell proliferation and is not a tumor suppressor protein.",Excluded
564,"IBS19.02 Novel Radiotherapy Approaches in Small Cell Lung Carcinoma - Has SABR and Radionuclide Therapy Got a Role to Play?. Thoracic radiotherapy has been shown in to increase overall survival when added to systemic therapy in patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and M0 stage. The dose, fractionation, treatment time and timing issues have not been fully resolved. A recent study did not show the superiority of 66Gy in 33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks over twice-daily radiotherapy to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks twice daily [1]. For stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has been clearly shown to be superior to conventional fractionation [2]. Given the clear benefit seen in early stage NSCLC, it is postulated that SABR may have a role to play in early stage SCLC. A recent multi-institutional cohort study has reported favourable outcomes in this setting [3]. However, randomised data of equivalence or indeed superiority are lacking. Furthermore, questions remain as the timing and role of systemic therapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation when SABR is used in this setting. In advanced SCLC, many tumors display neuroendocrine clinical and cytological features and many SCLC tumors express somatostatin receptor and this can be imaged using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE [4]. Given the uptake by some SCLC tumors of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE, higher doses of the tracer have been used in an attempt to provide radiolabelled radiotherapy treatment in metastatic disease in what has been described as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) [5]. This molecularly target radiotherapy is a potentially exciting therapeutic approach, but the ideal positioning of such therapy in tumors which are suitable for treatment with PRRT and the safety of PRRT with systemic therapy have yet to be determined.

1500,"Combining pedicle screw stimulation with spinal navigation, a protocol to maximize the safety of neural elements and minimize radiation exposure in thoracolumbar spine instrumentation. Purpose: The O-arm-based navigation increases the accuracy of pedicle screw positioning and offers the possibility of performing a 3D scan before wound closure. However, repeating the 3D scan exposes the patient to additional radiation. We combined O-arm navigation with pedicle screw (PS) stimulation followed by a 3D scan to evaluate their accuracy and aimed for the creation of a protocol that maximizes the safety and minimizes radiation. Method(s): Patients had pedicle screws insertion using O-arm spinal navigation, then had PS triggered electromyography (EMG), and finally a 3D scan to evaluate the accuracy of screw position. Result(s): 447 screws were inserted in 71 patients. In 10 patients, 11 screws needed repositioning. Comparing results of PS triggered EMG responses to the 3D scan, we found: (a) negative stimulation response with negative 3D scan findings, corresponding to 432 acceptable screw position (96.6 %) in 58 patients (81.7 %). In these cases, the redo 3D scan could be avoided. (b) Positive stimulation response with positive 3D scan findings, corresponding to 7 unacceptable screw position (1.5 %) in 6 patients (8.4 %). In these cases, PS stimulation detected malpositioned screws that would be missed without a redo 3D scan. Conclusion(s): We propose a protocol of routinely performing PS stimulation after screw insertion using spinal navigation. In case of positive stimulation, a 3D scan must be performed to rule out a probable screw mal position (6 patients 8.4 %). However, in case of negative stimulation, redo 3D scan can be avoided in 81.7 % of patients. Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1607,"Space motion sickness: incidence, etiology, and countermeasures. Space motion sickness is experienced by 60% to 80% of space travelers during their first 2 to 3 days in microgravity and by a similar proportion during their first few days after return to Earth. Space motion sickness symptoms are similar to those in other forms of motion sickness; they include: pallor, increased body warmth, cold sweating, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and anorexia. These are important because they may affect the operational performance of astronauts. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain space motion sickness: the fluid shift hypothesis and the sensory conflict hypothesis. The fluid shift hypothesis suggests that space motion sickness results from the cranial shifting of body fluids resulting from the loss of hydrostatic pressure gradients in the lower body when entering microgravity. The cranial fluid shifts lead to visible puffiness in the face, and are thought to increase the intracranial pressure, the cerebrospinal-fluid pressure or the inner ear fluid pressures, altering the response properties of the vestibular receptors and inducing space motion sickness. The sensory conflict hypothesis suggests that loss of tilt-related otolith signals upon entry into microgravity causes a conflict between actual and anticipated signals from sense organs subserving spatial orientation. Such sensory conflicts are thought to induce motion sickness in other environments. Space motion sickness is usually treated using pharmaceuticals, most of which have undesirable side effects. Further studies elucidating the underlying mechanism for space motion sickness may be required for developing new treatments. [References: 19]",Excluded

1436,"Subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of young rabbits as a secondary matrix. A high-resolution autoradiographic study. Cell genesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of 2-month-old rabbits has been investigated. After incorporation of tritiated thymidine, electron microscopic autoradiography allowed description of the ultrastructure of the cells labelled and the progressive transformation of these cells into granular neurons to be followed. Quantitative evaluation of the time course of this transformation has been performed by light microscope autoradiography using 1-micrometer sections. Precursor cells, labelled initially with 3H-thymidine, were transformed after 5 days into early neuroblasts, these cells in turn giving rise to neurons some 8 days later. At the latest time period examined (42 days), 80% of the labelled cells were neurons; more than 10% remained as precursor cells. It is suspected that the latter may behave as reserve cells. Small numbers of glial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, scattered throughout the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the molecular layer, were found labelled, and it is possible that they arise from a different precusor pool. It is concluded that the subgranular zone functions as a secondary matrix for granule neurons of the dentate gyrus in young rabbits. These late-forming and apparently synaptically uncommitted neurons may be recruited during the development and refinement of postnatal behavioral substrates, by one or other of the dominant afferent systems.",Excluded
2505,"Pharmacokinetics of the potent hallucinogen, salvinorin A in primates parallels the rapid onset and short duration of effects in humans. Salvia divinorum, a mint plant originally used by the Mazatecs of Oaxaca, Mexico in spiritual rituals has gained popularity, in smoked form, as a legal hallucinogen in the United States and Europe. Abuse results in rapid onset and short-lasting effects that include visual hallucinations and motor-function impairment. Salvinorin A, the psychoactive component of S. divinorum, is a uniquely potent agonist at kappa-opioid receptors, targets for new therapeutic drugs. We labeled salvinorin A with C-11 by acylation of salvinorin B with [11C]-acetyl chloride to study whether its kinetic behavior in the brain parallels its uniquely fast, yet brief physiological effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies performed in 6 adult female baboons indicated extremely rapid brain uptake reaching a peak accounting for 3.3% of the total administered dose in 40 s and clearing with a half-life of 8 min. [11C]-salvinorin A was distributed throughout the brain with the highest concentration in the cerebellum and a notable concentration in the visual cortex, perhaps accounting for its physiological effects when smoked. Naloxone administration did not reduce the overall concentration of [11C]-salvinorin A significantly nor did it change its regional distribution. Peripheral organ kinetics suggested at least two modes of metabolism and excretion occur: through the renal and biliary systems. Our findings have revealed that the exceptionally rapid uptake and brief duration of salvinorin A in the brain match the time-course of visual hallucinations for S. divinorum when smoked. The effects of salvinorin A may occur at <10 mug in the human brain, emphasizing its remarkable potency.",Excluded
662,"Interstitial irradiation with stereotactically implanted I-125 seeds for the treatment of cerebral glioma. Owing to its low rate of side effects and its high efficacy, interstitial irradiation with low-activity seeds should be the first therapeutic step in small (maximal diameter 40 mm), well-circumscribed, low-grade gliomas affecting the brain stem, other midline structures, or eloquent cerebral areas. In anaplastic gliomas, a therapeutic schedule using low-activity seeds and combining interstitial irradiation with radiotherapy (reduced boost dose of 15-30 Gy) seems to be more effective than interstitial irradiation alone. Compared with interstitial irradiation with high-activity seeds, this combined irradiation schedule caused no space-occupying radiation necrosis. Thus, it can be recommended as up-front treatment in patients with small (maximal diameter <40 mm) inoperable anaplastic gliomas. The use of high-activity I-125 seeds and interstitial irradiation at comparably high dose rates, integrating a small penumbra of normal brain tissue into the treatment volume, improved survival significantly in patients with primary highly malignant gliomas. In patients with recurrent tumors, the same treatment schedule did not substantially prolong survival compared with results obtained after resection plus radiotherapy. Owing to the high frequency of space-occupying radiation necrosis (40-60%), this schedule is only applicable in surgically accessible tumors. The application of low-activity I-125 seeds (in primary glioblastomas in combination with radiotherapy, in recurrent tumors without radiotherapy) yielded a median survival comparable with conventionally treated patients. There was no need for reoperation because of radiation necrosis. Thus, this treatment schedule is useful in both operable and surgically inaccessible glioblastomas.",Excluded

The use of a commercial handset as an exposure source for such investigations is problematic for a number of reasons and therefore a simulated exposure source, capable of producing both RE and ELF components of exposure, is desirable. As a first step in developing such a source, we have quantified and characterized the ELF field from several commercial handsets (the RF characteristics being already well understood).

3434,"Quetiapine attenuates cognitive impairment and decreases seizure susceptibility possibly through promoting myelin development in a rat model of malformations of cortical development. Developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and refractory epilepsy are the most frequent consequences found in patients suffering from malformations of cortical development (MCD). However, therapeutic options for these psychiatric and neurological comorbidities are currently limited. The development of white matter undergoes dramatic changes during postnatal brain maturation, thus myelination deficits resulting from MCD contribute to its comorbid diseases. Consequently, drugs specifically targeting white matter are a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of MCD. We have used an in utero irradiation rat model of MCD to investigate the effects of postnatal quetiapine treatment on brain myelination as well as neuropsychological and cognitive performances and seizure susceptibility. Fatally irradiated rats were treated with quetiapine (10mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P30. We found that postnatal administration of quetiapine attenuated object recognition memory impairment and improved long-term spatial memory in the irradiated rats. Quetiapine treatment also reduced the susceptibility and severity of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Importantly, quetiapine treatment resulted in an inhibition of irradiation-induced myelin breakdown in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum. These findings suggest that quetiapine may have beneficial, postnatal effects in the irradiated rats, strongly suggesting that improving MCD-derived white matter pathology is a possible underlying mechanism. Collectively, these results indicate that brain myelination represents an encouraging pharmacological target to improve the prognosis of patients with MCD.",Excluded

The in vitro experiments indicated M1 macrophages promote the cell viability of astrocytes and the expression of CSPG. However, PBM significantly inhibited the expression of GFAP, decreased activation of astrocyte, and downregulated the expression of CSPG by regulating M1 macrophages.

889,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. [German]. Hyperbaric oxygenation is defined as the administration of 100% oxygen in a compression chamber at an ambient pressure greater than one atmosphere absolute. The increased pressure (up to three atmospheres) induces a 10- to 15-fold plasma oxygen concentration resulting in increased tissue oxygenation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the bactericidal capacity of leukocytes, stimulates important mechanisms in wound healing, reduces tissue oedema and maintains tissue oxygenation even in the absence of haemoglobin. Commonly accepted indications supported by scientific evidence include the decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, severe carbon monoxide poisoning, delayed radiation injury, clostridial myonecrosis and also the improvement of healing of vulnerable skin or soft tissue grafts. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also used in healing difficulties of specific problem wounds, extreme blood loss, intracranial abscesses, necrotizing soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, crush syndrome, burns and sudden deafness. Since hyperbaric oxygenation involves the administration of oxygen in a pharmacological dose, side effects are possible due to barotrauma and oxygen toxicity. During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, an increased amount of oxygen-free radicals may be generated, depending on the duration and extent of pressure elevation during treatment. Although many different organ systems may be affected, the brain is of greatest clinical significance.

174,"A radical approach to cancer. Reactive oxygen species are known to be potentially dangerous, but are also needed for signal-transduction pathways. Tumor cells have relatively low amounts of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which quenches superoxide anion (O2(-*)), and as a result of a higher level of aerobic metabolism, higher concentrations of O2(-*) , compared to normal cells. But this may not be true of all tumor cells. Some tumor cells have relatively higher amounts of vitamin E, a potent anti-oxidant, and a higher level of anaerobic metabolism, resulting in a balance that is tilted more towards higher anti-oxidant capacity. In both instances of higher aerobic and anaerobic metabolism methods designed to augment free radical generation in tumor cells can cause their death. It is suggested that free radicals and lipid peroxides suppress the expression of Bcl-2, activate caspases and shorten telomere, and thus inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Ionizing radiation, anthracyclines, bleomycin and cytokines produce free radicals and thus are useful as anti-cancer agents. But they also produce many side-effects. 2-methoxyoestradiol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit SODs and cause an increase of O2(-*) in tumor cells leading to their death. In addition, PUFAs (especially gamma-linolenic acid), 2-methoxyoestradiol and thalidomide may possess anti-angiogenic activity. This suggests that free radicals can suppress angiogenesis. Limited clinical studies done with gamma-linolenic acid showed that it can regress human brain gliomas without any significant side-effects. Thus, PUFAs, thalidomide and 2-methoxyoestradiol or their derivatives may offer a new radical approach to the treatment of cancer. [References: 173]",Excluded

This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences.METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system.RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded
937,"Macrophage attenuation of neuronal excitability: implications for pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Brain macrophages (and microglia) play a crucial role in central nervous system immune and inflammatory responses. They are also critical cells in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. To understand how macrophages cause neural cell dysfunction, we investigated the effects of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) on rat cortical neuronal physiology in a BMDM-neuronal co-culture system using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. When co-cultured with neuronal cells, BMDMs hyperpolarized the neuronal membrane and attenuated both spontaneous and electrically evoked firings through a decrease in membrane input resistance. The average duration of evoked action potentials (APs) and the latency to fire the APs, in response to a constant depolarizing current injection, were significantly increased by BMDMs. These results indicate that BMDMs attenuate neuronal excitability. Further investigation revealed that BMDMs hyperpolarize neuronal membranes by enhancing neuronal delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), which was blocked by tetraethylammonium. This BMDM-induced attenuation on neuronal excitability may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction and damage as seen in neurodegenerative disorders.",Excluded

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, highly aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous neoplasm which is often located in the head and neck district. This carcinoma has the same characteristics as small cell tumors and tends to significant metastatization both through the lymph nodes and through the blood. It is also prone to frequent recurrence. Today diagnosis is facilitated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to search for neurofilaments and cytocheratin 20. The treatment of choice is radical surgery ensuring a tumor-free edge of at least 3 cm, associated with supplementary local radiotherapy.

1022,"Disorder in Pixel-Level Edge Directions on T1WI Is Associated with the Degree of Radiation Necrosis in Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: Preliminary Findings. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (COLLAGE) is a recently developed radiomic (computer extracted) feature that captures entropy (measures the degree of disorder) in pixel-level edge directions and was previously shown to distinguish predominant cerebral radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor on gadolinium-contrast T1WI. In this work, we sought to investigate whether COLLAGE measurements from posttreatment gadolinium-contrast T1WI could distinguish varying extents of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor classes in a lesion across primary and metastatic brain tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: On a total of 75 gadolinium-contrast T1WI studies obtained from patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the extent of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor in every brain lesion was histopathologically defined by an expert neuropathologist as the following: 1) ""pure"" cerebral radiation necrosis; 2) ""mixed"" pathology with coexistence of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumors; 3) ""predominant"" (>80%) cerebral radiation necrosis; 4) predominant (>80%) recurrent tumor; and 5) pure tumor. COLLAGE features were extracted from the expert-annotated ROIs on MR imaging. Statistical comparisons of COLLAGE measurements using first-order statistics were performed across pure, mixed, and predominant pathologies of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: COLLAGE features exhibited decreased skewness for patients with pure (0.15 +/- 0.12) and predominant cerebral radiation necrosis (0.25 +/- 0.09) and were statistically significantly different (P < .05) from those in patients with predominant recurrent tumors, which had highly skewed (0.42 +/- 0.21) COLLAGE values. COLLAGE values for the mixed pathology studies were found to lie between predominant cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor categories.CONCLUSIONS: With additional independent multisite validation, COLLAGE measurements might enable noninvasive characterization of the degree of recurrent tumor or cerebral radiation necrosis in gadolinium-contrast T1WI of posttreatment lesions.",Excluded

Radioguided surgery is a new method for diagnosing and treating many tumours and uses introperative gamma probes. The use and development of intraoperative gamma probes in the last 10 years has enabled the development of minimally invasive procedures in oncological surgery, with an improvement in both the survival rate and the quality of life.

1198,"Spontaneous quantal events induced in toad rods by pigment bleaching. Barlow proposed that absolute visual threshold is limited by photon-like noise events in the rod photoreceptors, and he later extended the idea to explain the elevation of threshold following bright bleaching lights in terms of increased noise in the photoreceptors. Rushton, on the other hand, has proposed that the threshold elevation during dark adaptation involves changes not within the photoreceptors themselves but rather in the gain of a subsequent 'pool'. I report here measurements of outer segment current in individual rod photoreceptors which demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations occur at a greatly increased rate following bleaches of around 1%, and that these fluctuations have the form expected for random occurrences of the single photon events. This is consistent with Barlow's ideas but does not indicate whether a gain change subsequent to the receptors also occurs.",Excluded
1908,"Skeletal muscle metastasis presenting as an initial manifestation of lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, presents as a metastatic disease in majority of the cases. The most frequent sites of distant metastases are liver, adrenal glands, bones, and brain. Skeletal muscle metastasis as a mode of presentation of lung cancer is a rare phenomenon which is often discovered at autopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male, with forty pack years history of smoking, presented with a painful right, distal thigh swelling for two months and unintentional weight loss of twenty pounds. Examination of right distal thigh revealed a tender, hard, non fluctuant mass, with surrounding erythema. Complete blood count, basic metabolic and hepatic function panel were unremarkable. Chest x ray showed large mass in right lower lobe with a smaller nodule in the right upper lobe which was confirmed by computed tomography ( CT) of the chest. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right lower extremity showed 5.5 x 4.0 x 6.2 cm soft tissue mass in lateral aspect of the distal thigh adjacent to femur. The patient underwent CT guided biopsies of the right lower lobe lung mass and the right thigh mass. Pathology of the lung mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1) and that of the right thigh mass revealed poorly differentiated malignant tumor most consistent with metastatic non small cell carcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin). Positron-emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) demonstrated hypermetabolic right lower lobe lung mass and right upper lobe lung nodule, a large right knee soft tissue mass and multiple hypermetabolic soft tissue lesions throughout the muscles of the body along with jugular, external iliac and inguinal hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies. The patient was started on palliative radiation to the right distal thigh. Chemotherapy was not administered due to rapidly deteriorating clinical status. The patient died of septic shock within 4 weeks of diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Skeletal muscle is an exceptionally rare site of metastasis of lung cancer(1). The local pH and the contractile property of skeletal muscle do not favor metastasis. Delay in the diagnosis may occur due to its clinical and radiological resemblance to diseases like abscess and soft tissue sarcoma. Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the muscle mass. Treatment is palliative, and majority of the patients die within 1 year of diagnosis (2,3) CONCLUSION(S): Lung cancer with skeletal muscle metastasis should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with intramuscular mass.",Excluded

The medial part of the nucleus of Edinger-Westphal (EWM) in birds mediates light-regulated adaptive increases in choroidal blood flow (ChBF). We sought to characterize the effect of loss of EWM-mediated ChBF regulation on photoreceptor health in pigeons housed in either moderate intensity diurnal or constant light (CL). Photoreceptor abundance following complete EWM destruction was compared to that following a lesion in the pupil control circuit (as a control for spread of EWM lesions to the nearby pupil-controlling lateral EW) or following no EW damage. Birds were housed post-lesion in a 12 h 400 lux light/12 h dark light cycle for up to 16.5 months, or in constant 400 lux light for up to 3 weeks. Paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixed eyes were embedded in plastic, sectioned, slide-mounted, and stained with toluidine blue/azure II. Blinded analysis of photoreceptor outer segment abundance was performed, with outer segment types distinguished by oil droplet tint and laminar position. Brains were examined histologically to assess lesion accuracy. Disruption of pupil control had no adverse effect on photoreceptor outer segment abundance in either diurnal light or CL, but EWM destruction led to 50-60% loss of blue/violet cone outer segments in both light conditions, and a 42% loss of principal cone outer segments in CL. The findings indicate that adaptive regulation of ChBF by the EWM circuit plays a role in maintaining photoreceptor health and mitigates the harmful effect of light on photoreceptors, especially short wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Splenomegaly occurs frequently in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), indicating significant splenic metaplasia. Symptomatic radiation therapy can be delivered, but the best irradiation scheme is still unknown. Results of splenic irradiation in patients with myelofibrosis or chronic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 24 patients: 15 presented with MF and 9 with CML. Median irradiation doses were 9.8 and 7.7 Gy, respectively. The hematologic toxicity was moderate (except for platelets in the acute phase of the disease).RESULTS: No toxicity was observed. Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy.CONCLUSION: To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients.",Excluded

3429,"Identification of novel p53 target genes in ionizing radiation response. The tumor suppressor p53 plays an essential role in cellular adaptation to stress. In response to ionizing radiation, p53 regulates the transcription of genes in a diverse set of pathways including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Previously, we identified by microarray analysis a set of genes that are transcriptionally activated or repressed in response to radiation exposure. In this study, we use computational methods and molecular techniques, including location analysis (ChIP-on-chip assay), to identify ionizing radiation-responsive genes that are directly regulated by p53. Among the 489 ionizing radiation-responsive genes examined, 38 genes were found to be p53 targets. Some of these genes are previously known to be directly regulated by p53 whereas others are novel p53 targets. We further showed that the novel p53 target genes are transcriptionally regulated by p53. The binding of p53 to promoters of target genes correlated with increased transcript levels of these genes in cells with functional p53. However, p53 binding and subsequent transcriptional activation of these target genes were significantly diminished in cells with mutant p53 and in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia, which have impaired p53 activation following ionizing radiation exposure. Identification and characterization of ionizing radiation-responsive p53 target genes extend our knowledge of the diverse role that p53 plays in the DNA damage response.",Excluded

2546,"Routine Postoperative Computed Tomography Is Not Helpful After Elective Craniotomy. Background: Next-day postoperative computed tomography (CT) has been routinely used to obtain radiographic ""clearance"" for transferring patients after elective craniotomy out of the intensive care unit. The value of this traditional policy, however, has repeatedly been questioned. However, the limited patient numbers might have underestimated the very rare, but catastrophic, events. Therefore, we analyzed the value of routine postoperative CT in a larger cohort of elective tumor, epilepsy, and vascular cases. Method(s): All the patients who had undergone elective craniotomy were included in our study. The routine postoperative CT scans were analyzed by a neuroradiologist who was unaware of the clinical data. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for events of arterial hypertension and clinical deterioration. Result(s): The data from 660 patients with tumors (n = 393; 59.5%), aneurysms (n = 107; 16.2%), and skull base lesions were evaluated. In nearly one half of the patients (n = 264; 45.8%), CT depicted the presence of blood that was not associated with symptoms. Of the 660 patients, 21 (3.6%) showed a mass effect radiographically, 11 of whom underwent revision surgery. Arterial hypertension was documented in only 8 patients (1.3%) and was related to the revision surgery (P = 0.018). The overall revision rate was 2.7% (n = 18). All patients who had undergone revision for postoperative hematoma had presented with a new neurological deficit immediately before CT. Conclusion(s): Routine postoperative CT did not reveal 1 patient with a serious hematoma that would not have been identified by clinical examination. Patients could be transferred safely from the intensive care unit, if the weaning process and clinical observation findings were uneventful, without deterioration of neurological symptoms or consciousness.

701,"The discovery and development of new potential antioxidant agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Introduction: Several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases have had associations with the oxidative process and free radical damage. Consequently, in past decades, several natural and synthetic antioxidants have been assessed as therapeutic agents but have shown limitations in bioavailability, metabolic susceptibility and permeability to the blood brain barrier. Given these issues, medicinal chemists are hard at work to modify/improve the chemical structures of these antioxidants, thereby improving their efficacy. Areas covered: In this review, the authors critically analyze several biological mechanisms involved in the generation of free radicals. Additionally, they analyze free radicals' role in the generation of oxidative stress and in the progression of many NDs. Further, the authors review a collection of natural and synthetic antioxidants, their role as free radical scavengers along with their mechanisms of action and their potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Expert opinion: So far, preclinical studies on several antioxidants have shown promise for treating NDs, despite their limitations. The authors do highlight the lack of the adequate animal models for preclinical assessment and this does hinder further progression into clinical trials. Further studies are necessary to fully investigate the potential of these antioxidants as ND therapeutic options. © Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

To understand the technique and results of IRE No abstract available. Special Session Intraprocedural radiation dose management 103.1 Occupational dosimetry in the interventional laboratory: dose limits and risk estimation G. Bartal Radiology, Meir MC, Kfar-Saba, Israel Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the potential risks of occupational radiation exposure 2. To learn about the dose limits for different organs and acceptable dose 3. To learn how to estimate the risks As more evidence is emerging from recent publications on the dangers of occupational radiation exposure in Image (Fluoroscopy) guided interventions there is a clear need to recognize the risks, to learn about staff dose limits and the ways to reduce the possible damage to a Minimum. Recent publications confirm the alarming incidence and variety of occupational-related illnesses of medical staff working in the interventional laboratory (1, 2, 3). International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) issued a new recommendation for the occupational dose limit to the lens of the eye based on the new threshold for lens effects and the suggested equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye was reduced from 150mSv year-1 (ICRP 2013 Proceedings) to 20mSv year-1, averaged over a 5-year period, with no year's dose exceeding 50mSv (ICRP, 2012). Last International and European BSS (Basic Safety Standards) comprises new limit (European Commission, 2012; IAEA, 2014) for the medical staff (1). Relatively high exposure doses have been reported for both extremities (2) and the eye lens (3, 4) of the Interventional Radiologists (IRs) that in some cases, exceed the personal dose limits. Moreover, new controlled data suggest lower or even no dose threshold for radiation- induced eye lens injuries. These data are under consideration by the ICRP and may lead to the re-evaluation of the existing dose limit (1). There is no ""acceptable dose"" definition or recommendation for the personnel, as it depends on the specific applications and is different for public, workers and patients. There are dose limits for the personnel, which are not applicable to the medical exposure of patients. Noticeably, new dose thresholds, particularly the 0.5 Gy threshold for the lens of the eye, affect occupational protection for operators and other staff, which is principally important for fluoroscopically guided procedures (1, 6). Regrettably, not all operators protect their eyes or their brain sufficiently during interventions. After several years of work without proper protection, cumulative absorbed doses to the lens can exceed 0.5 Gy [ RELID (Retrospective Evaluation of Lens Injuries and Dose) (see: https://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/ news/relid-cataract-study.htm)]. During most of the IAEA surveys of radiation-related lens opacities in interventionalists and staff, 40-50% of the professionals involved in interventional cardiology procedures who volunteered to be examined had posterior subcapsular lens opacities (2, 3, 4). Only 10% of the members of the control groups had such opacities. Important to note that most of the observed lens opacities were in interventionists who had worked for several years without any eye protection. The dose rate to the operator can exceed 10 mSv h-1 when the 'high-dose' fluoroscopy mode is used and 50 mSv h-1 during cine acquisition. The highest dose rate was recorded at the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO 90) projection, which corresponds to the lateral projection when the operator is standing at the tube side (4, 5). Many medical specialties outside the imaging departments (e.g. vascular surgery, urology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, anaesthetics and pain management) are starting to use or increase their use of fluoroscopically guided procedures in surgical theatres without the radiation protection tools available in standard interventional laboratories (ICRP, 2010). Such a practice may result in occupational doses or these physicians that are higher than the typical values recorded in interventional radiology and cardiology services, where protection tools are used regularly (6). Lack of compliance with the regular use of personal dosimetry has been a problem for many years in many countries (5, 7). This is one of the reasons for the shortage of an accurate occupational dose data (and reliable radiation risk estimations) in different professional groups. One of the methods of estimating staff doses is working on Monte Carlo calculations and detection of staff location in the catheterisation laboratory to calculate approximately staff doses during clinical procedures through the use of radiographic and geometric data. Another method that was recently published is use of a realistic approach to estimate lens doses in interventional cardiology when personal dosimeters are not used regularly. The authors concluded that for around 2000 diagnostic, PCI, and valvular procedures, when the median scatter dose value per procedure at the C-arm was 0.78, 1.07, and 1.45 mSv, respectively (4). Lens doses are approximately 50-60% of these values when radiation protection tools are not used. For all of these procedures, the ratio between the scatter dose at the C-arm and the kerma-area product was 10.3-11.3 mSv(Gy cm2)-1 (6). Several medical societies including CIRSE and SIR have published or endorsed documents on occupational protection that are also expected to improve staff radiation safety (7). New ethical issues are emerging in situations where reducing patient dose involves increasing staff doses and vice versa. Occupational radiological protection is still a challenge in several clinical situations. ICRP has included specific recommendations and advice for occupational protection in most of its publications in recent years (ICRP, 2000, 2007 a,b,c, 2009, 2010, 2013 a,b). Operator dose (incident air kerma) at the typical working position is around 1/1000 of incident air kerma at the patient's skin, so the instantaneous dose rate to an unprotected operator may reach approximately 5mGymin-1. Newer active personal dosimeters display occupational dose rates in real time inside the interventional fluoroscopy suite, and allow subsequent detailed analyses of staff and patient doses by recording dose at very short intervals. This data on implementation of the real time active personnel dosimetry permit the development of new optimisation strategies to improve occupational protection (7, 9).",Excluded
215,"Roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase and ATM in cell-cycle-dependent radiation sensitivity in human cells. PURPOSE: The roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ATM in the cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity in human cells were investigated.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A DNA-PK activity-deficient human glioblastoma cell line M059J, ataxia telangiectasia cell lines AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, and control cell lines were used. Wortmannin inhibited DNA-PK and ATM activities. Cells were synchronized by hydroxyurea. Progression through the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: M059J exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle, with extreme hyper-radiosensitivity in G to early S-phase compared with the control cell line M059K. AT3BISV and AT5BIVA exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle but showed a similar pattern of cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity to that observed in LM217 or HeLa cells. In AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, radiosensitization by wortmannin was observed throughout the cell cycle and was most prominent in G1 to early S-phase. Wortmannin did not sensitize M059J to ionizing radiation in any cell-cycle phase. DNA-PK activities were not different throughout the cell cycle.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (1) non-homologous endjoining plays a dominant role in G1 to early S-phase and a minor role in late S to G2-phase in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, (2) the role of ATM in repairing double-strand breaks may be almost cell-cycle-independent and (3) the dominant role of non-homologous end-joining during G1 to early S-phase is not due to cell-cycle-dependent fluctuations in DNA-PK activity.",Excluded
213,"In vivo protein secretion by lung. Evidence for active secretion and interspecies differences. The present study is an attempt to determine (a) if the lung actively secretes protein into the surface-active fraction of lung lavage returns; (b) if there are interspecies differences in this secretory activity; and (c) if the amount of nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction shows interspecies variation. I found that pilocarpine stimulates the release of radioactive protein into the lavage surface-active fraction of rabbits and that this pilocarpine effect is completely blocked by atropine. Inhibition of lung oxygen consumption by iodoacetate is associaged with a dose-dependent inhibition of the pilocarpine-induced secretion. Microtubules may be involved in this secretory process because colchicine inhibits the pilocarpine effect. Of the radioactive protein in the total surface-active fraction (tissue plus lavage returns), a greater percent appears in the lavage surface-active fraction at 2 and 4 h, after a pulsed injection [U-14C] leucine, in the mouse than in the rat, which in turn has a greater amount than the rabbit. There is also a difference in the amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction of different species: mouse greater than rabbit greater than cat greater than dog. The amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction is directly proportional to the species respiratory rate; the log of the nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction is inversely proportional to the log of the species alveolar diameter. I conclude that the lung actively secretes protein into the lavage surface-active fraction, that this secretion is under neurohumoral regulation, and that respiratory rate and alveolar size may influence this secretory activity and the amount of protein in this surface-active fraction.",Excluded

Indicators for therapeutic effects including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), adverse reactions, recurrence and metastasis of tumor and serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of patients were also compared. Result(s): Before the intervention, there was no difference in cognitive function score among all the patients (P=0.876). After the treatment, no significant difference was found for RR among groups (P=0.245), however, patients in the Ce group showed the highest cognitive function score (P<0.001); the differences in adverse reactions including dry mouth (P=0.026, Ce vs. H; P=0.000, Ce vs. I; P=0.000, H vs. I), oral mucositis (P=0.060, Ce vs. H; P=0.008, Ce vs. I; P=0.396, H vs. I), skin reaction (P=0.654, Ce vs. H; P=0.027, Ce vs. I; P=0.065, H vs. I), irradiation otitis media (P=0.097, Ce vs. H; P=0.009, Ce vs. I; P=0.051, H vs. I) had statistical significance, and their incidence rates in Ce group were lowest. Meanwhile, recurrence and metastasis were less in the Ce group although the differences were insignificant (P=0.302 and 0.638). The serum level of CEA was notably lower in Ce group (P=0.031, Ce vs. H; P=0.020, Ce vs. I; P=0.512, H vs. I). Life quality scores about cognitive function and role function of H group and Ce group were higher than that of I group while Ce group was the highest (Cognitive function: P=0.020, Ce vs. H; P=0.015, Ce vs. I and P=0.023, H vs. I; role function: P=0.039, Ce vs. H; P=0.011, Ce vs. I and P=0.031, H vs. I). Conclusion(s): Celecoxib combined with hippocampus sparing IMRT for the treatment of NPC patients could drastically alleviate cognitive dysfunction, improve life quality and reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with hippocampal sparing IMRT and IMRT only.

3351,"Transforming growth factor-beta promotes glioblastoma multiforme to establish radiation resistance by mesenchymal differentiation. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor. Current standard therapy is surgery combined with radio-therapy and/or chemo-therapy. Due to the existence of resistance, GBM is one of the most difficult-to-treat tumor. It has been shown radio-therapy may induce mesenchymal differentiation (MD). Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a modifier of radiation response, and plays an important role in cell transformation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TGF-beta pathway might be involved in the development of radiation resistance via regulating MD. Thus, we explored whether TGF-beta regulates MD in radiation resistance in GBM. We first examined the effect of radiation doses on cell viability by Trypan blue assay, and evaluated cell viability and morphology. The cells showed morphology change were defined as transformed cells. We used the radiation dose of 50% cell viability to establish consecutive-irradiation-induced resistance. The radiation dose of the cell viability greater than 50% was established high-dose-irradiation-induced resistance positive control. When viability of cells recovered from consecutive-irradiation exposures which were higher than positive control, the cells were defined as consecutive-irradiation-induced resistance. To develop radiation resistance, 3.5Gy exposure for 6 times were required for 1306MG, and 2Gy exposure for 4 times were needed for U87MG. The numbers of transformed cells increased in radiation resistant cells population. Moreover, immunocytochemistry staining showed expression of certain MD markers on transformed cells were different from on non-transformed cells. Immunoblotting results showed increased mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and decreased epithelial marker beta-catenin in radiation resistance. Finally, we used TGF-beta and TGF-beta receptor inhibitor LY364947 to determine if TGF-beta/Smad pathway regulates radiation-induced resistance. The immunoblotting results revealed that inhibition of TGF-beta pathway reversed MD in consecutive-irradiation-induced resistant cell lines via increasing the expression of beta-catenin and reducing the expression of N-cadherin and Fibronectin. We concluded that TGF-beta promotes GBM to establish radiation resistance by MD.",Excluded

In this study, by using the patch clamp technique in current clamp mode, we show that activation of this GABA receptor causes voltage changes of cones, which are closely dependent on the membrane potential level in relation to the chloride equilibrium potential of the cells. Furthermore, the OFF overshoot of cone light responses is enhanced or diminished when this receptor is potentiated by BIC or suppressed by I4AA, suggesting the involvement of this GABA receptor in shaping OFF light responses of bullfrog cones.",Excluded
485,"Radiotherapy of painful vertebral hemangiomas: the single center retrospective analysis of 137 cases. PURPOSE: An evaluation of dose-response relationship and an attempt to define predictive factors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 137 cases of painful vertebral hemangioma irradiations (101 patients). Fraction dose (fd) varied from 2 to 15 Gy (123 fractionated and 14 radiosurgical treatments), and total dose (TD) from 8 to 30 Gy (111 cases irradiated with fd of 2 GY to TD of 24 Gy). We evaluated pain relief, changes in analgesic requirements, and reossification.RESULTS: Means of pain relief 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after radiotherapy (defined as a decrease of primary pain level expressed in percent) were 60.5%, 65.4%, 68.3%, and 78.4%, respectively. Proportion of patients with no need for analgesics and patients using tramadol were 39%, 40%, 44%, 57%, and 20%, 17%, 22%, and 11% in these times. The proportion of patients experiencing complete/partial pain relief changed from 36/48% 1 month, to 64/22% 1.5 years after radiotherapy. No impact of radiotherapy on reossification was found. The positive impact of fd and TD increase for analgesics uptake reduction and pain relief was found. An increase of the fd by 1 Gy results in 27% chance of analgesics uptake reduction and 3.8% reduction of pain, whereas 14% analgesics uptake reduction and 2.2% of pain reduction in case of the TD. The predictive factors improving results were found: female gender, older age, better performance states (the chance of the lower analgesic treatment decreases over 2.5 times in comparison to the higher Zubrod degree), bigger Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data support the efficacy of radiotherapy in improving pain secondary to vertebral hemangioma, with the degree of pain amelioration being related to increasing fd and TD. The positive predictive factors were defined: female gender, older age, better performance status, increased Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration, and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.",Excluded

16,"Failure to restore vision after optic nerve regeneration in reptiles: interspecies variation in response to axotomy. Optic nerve regeneration within the reptiles is variable. In a snake, Viper aspis, and the lizard Gallotia galloti, regeneration is slow, although some retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons eventually reach the visual centers (Rio et al. [1989] Brain Res 479:151-156; Lang et al. [1998] Glia 23:61-74). By contrast, in a lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus, numerous RGC axons regenerate rapidly to the visual centers, but unless animals are stimulated visually, the regenerated projection lacks topography and animals remain blind via the experimental eye (Beazley et al. [2003] J. Neurotrauma 20:1263-1269). V. aspis, G. galloti, and C. ornatus belong respectively to the Serpentes, Lacertidae, and Agamidae within the Eureptilia, the major modern group of living reptiles comprising the Squamata (snakes, lizards, and geckos) and the Crocodyllia. Here we have extended the findings on Eureptilia to include two geckos (Gekkonidae), Cehyra variegata and Nephrurus stellatus. We also examined a turtle, Chelodina oblonga, the Testudines being the sole surviving representatives of the Parareptilia, the more ancient reptilian group. In all three species, visually elicited behavioral responses were absent throughout regeneration, a result supported electrophysiologically; axonal tracing revealed that only a small proportion of RGC axons crossed the lesion and none entered the contralateral optic tract. RGC axons failed to reach the chiasm in C. oblonga, and in G. variegata, and N. stellatus RGC axons entered the opposite optic nerve; a limited ipsilateral projection was seen in G. variegata. Our results support a heterogeneous response to axotomy within the reptiles, each of which is nevertheless dysfunctional.",Excluded
2640,"The effects of electrode material, charge density and stimulation duration on the safety of high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in rats. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of deep brain structures is a powerful therapeutic tool for the treatment of various movement disorders in patients. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of this therapeutic approach on basal ganglia network function are still largely unknown. Hitherto, experimental studies have focused on short-term stimulation. Since patients receive HFS for many years, animal studies which reproduce the conditions of long-term stimulation will be necessary to accurately investigate the effects of HFS. However, stimulation parameters of acute HFS cannot be easily transferred to long-term conditions. Accordingly, for this purpose we studied the influence of different charge densities (0, 3, 6.5, 13 and 26 microC/cm2/phase) and duration (4 h or 3 days) of subthalamic nucleus (STN)-HFS using stainless-steel and platinum-iridium (Pt/Ir) electrodes on neuronal tissue damage in rats. Our data demonstrate the advantage of Pt/Ir over stainless-steel electrodes when used in short-term HFS (frequency 130 Hz, pulse width 60 micros) and indicate that HFS using Pt/Ir-electrodes pulsed with 3 microC/cm2/phase over 3 days did not produce any relevant tissue damage in the STN.",Excluded

Treatment of acute motion sickness induced by parabolic flight with a preparation of scopolamine placed in the buccal pouch was investigated. Twenty-one subjects flew aboard a KC-135 aircraft operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) which performed parabolic maneuvers resulting in periods of 0-g, 1-g, and 1.8-g. Each subject flew once with a tablet containing scopolamine and once with a placebo in a random order, crossover design. Signs and symptoms of motion sickness were systematically recorded during each parabola by an investigator who was blind to the content of the tablet. Compared with flights using placebo, flights with buccal scopolamine resulted in significantly lower scores for nausea (31%-35% reduction) and vomiting (50% reduction in number of parabolas with vomiting). Side effects of the drug during flight were negligible. We conclude that buccal scopolamine is more effective than a placebo in treating ongoing motion sickness.",Excluded
214,"De Novo Development of Moyamoya Disease after Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation in a Patient With RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys (rs112735431). BACKGROUND: Reports of cases diagnosed as Moyamoya disease (MMD) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are extremely rare. In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",Excluded

Purpose: It is well known that an intracranial non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT), especially poor prognosis group which demonstrated high level of serum tumor marker has poor prognosis due to CSF dissemination or local recurrence. The objective of this study was to determine whether the combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy was effective in patients with poor prognosis group of intracranial NGGCT. Patient(s): Since 1998, we have had 24 patients with an intracranial NGGCT. These consisted of an intermediate group (IG) with 10 cases, and a poor group (PG) with 14 cases. NAT (neo-adjuvant therapy), which is preceding chemotherapy before surgery, was performed in 11 cases which presented with serum b-HCG of over 500 mIU/ml or AFP 500 ng/ml and a reduced teratoma component in neuro-imagings. Radical surgery was done in another 13 cases. The chemotherapy regimen was CARE (carboplatin, etoposide) for IG. Since 2006, we have shifted the chemotherapy from ICE regimen (ifosfamide, cisplatin, etoposide) (8 cases) to the JCO2004 regimen (cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, carboplatin) (6 cases) to strengthen chemotherapy for PG followed by reduced dose of radiation. Result(s): The total follow-up period was 6.7 years. Two patients showed rapid tumor growth after chemotherapy in so called ""growing teratoma syndrome."" Four patients in NAT (40%) demonstrated complete remission after only chemotherapy. In PG, five of eight in ICE (62%) died (recurrence: 4, radiation induced glioblastoma: 1), none showed tumor recurrence in the JCO 2004 regimen. All patients in IG survived without tumor recurrence. The 3-year, 5-year and 10 year survival rate of PG was 68%, 68% and 51%, respectively.

At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting 2014, the most striking abstracts on lung cancer treatment addressed-as expected-aspects of targeted therapy. The most probable practice changing data came from the presentation of the PROFILE 1014 trial dealing with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients treated with crizotinib or chemotherapy in the first-line setting, which confirmed a comparable degree of benefit from crizotinib treatment as reported in second-line treatment. After 10 years of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy, there were for the first time reports on phase I data on new agents showing efficacy in tyrosine-kinase inhibitor pre-treated patients with secondary resistance (i.e. T790M mutation). Monoclonal antibodies directed against EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor given in addition to conventional chemotherapy (SQUIRE and REVEL, respectively) resulted in significant but less impressive results. Notable improvements in overall survival in these two studies were not restricted to patients with adenocarcinoma but proved beneficial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma as well. Unfortunately, as in the aftermath of many past ASCO meetings, there will be no significant changes concerning systemic treatment of small cell lung cancer in the near future.

2012,"Statistical properties of cerebral CT perfusion imaging systems. Part I. Cerebral blood volume maps generated from nondeconvolution-based systems. Purpose: The development and clinical employment of a computed tomography (CT) imaging system benefit from a thorough understanding of the statistical properties of the output images; cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) imaging system is no exception. A series of articles will present statistical properties of CTP systems and the dependence of these properties on system parameters. This Part I paper focuses on the signal and noise properties of cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps calculated using a nondeconvolution-based method. Method(s): The CBV imaging chain was decomposed into a cascade of subimaging stages, which facilitated the derivation of analytical models for the probability density function, mean value, and noise variance of CBV. These models directly take CTP source image acquisition, reconstruction, and postprocessing parameters as inputs. Both numerical simulations and in vivo canine experiments were performed to validate these models. Result(s): The noise variance of CBV is linearly related to the noise variance of source images and is strongly influenced by the noise variance of the baseline images. Uniformly partitioning the total radiation dose budget across all time frames was found to be suboptimal, and an optimal dose partition method was derived to minimize CBV noise. Results of the numerical simulation and animal studies validated the derived statistical properties of CBV. Conclusion(s): The statistical properties of CBV imaging systems can be accurately modeled by extending the linear CT systems theory. Based on the statistical model, several key signal and noise characteristics of CBV were identified and an optimal dose partition method was developed to improve the image quality of CBV.

2230,"Evaluation of a new foetal shielding device for pregnant brain tumour patients. Background: The present study aimed to propose a new foetal shielding device for pregnant cancer patients to reduce the foetal dose associated with treatment techniques using multiple gantry angles, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Three shielding structures were designed to minimise the scattered and leaked radiation from various gantry angles and radiation scattering within the patient. The base-plate part that can be placed on the treatment couch was designed to reduce the scattered and leaked radiation generated at gantry angles located near 180degree. A body shielding part that can cover the lower chest and abdomen was designed, and a neck-shielding structure was added to reduce the internal and external radiation scattering from the treatment area. Evaluation plans were generated to assess the foetal dose reduction by the foetal shielding device in terms of the shielding material thickness, distance from the field edge, and shielding component using the flattened 6 MV photon beam (6MV) and flattening filter-free 6 MV photon beam (6MV-FFF). In addition, the effectiveness of the foetal shielding device was evaluated in a pregnant brain tumour patient. Result(s): The shielding material consisting of three parts was placed on frames composed of four arch shapes with a vertical curved structure, connection bar at the top position, and base plate. Each shielding part resulted in reductions in the radiation dose according to the treatment technique, as the thickness of the shielding material increased and the foetal dose decreased. In addition, a foetal dose reduction of approximately 50% was confirmed at 50 cm from the field edge by using the designed shielding device in most delivery techniques. In patients, the newly designed shielding structures can effectively eliminate up to about 49% of the foetal dose generated from various gantry angles used in VMAT or IMRT. Conclusion(s): We designed a foetal shielding device consisting of three parts to effectively reduce the dose delivered to the foetus, and evaluated the device with various treatment techniques for a pregnant patient with brain tumour. The foetal shielding device shielded the scattered/leaked radiation from the treatment machine, and also effectively reduced internal scattering from the treatment area in the patient.

Introduction: Radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) is a toxicity that can occur in 40-80 % of individuals who receive radiation treatment. Current guidelines recommend 5-hydroxytryptamine<inf>3</inf> receptor antagonists (5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs) for prophylaxis of RINV for moderate and highly emetogenic radiotherapy; however, certain patients may suffer from RINV despite prophylaxis. Objective(s): To determine if switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs is successful in the treatment and further prophylaxis of RINV. Method(s): This report details the case of a 47-year-old female with extensive bony involvement to the spine from breast cancer presenting with lower back pain. To palliate her symptoms, the patient underwent a course of irradiation to the lumbar spine and was prescribed ondansetron as an antiemetic. However, the patient experienced severe nausea and emesis and was subsequently switched to granisetron and aprepitant. Result(s): The patient completed the remainder of the radiation treatment with no further emesis and minimal nausea, representing the first documented success of granisetron and aprepitant for RINV after failure on ondansetron. Conclusion(s): In chemotherapy, switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs after failure on the first is successful in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), yet this has not been previously observed in radiation. In this patient, granisetron and aprepitant were successful in substantially reducing nausea and preventing further emesis, and may represent an alternative antiemetic regimen for RINV prophylaxis and salvage.

315,"Effect of Nox2 inhibition unloading-induced changes in morphology and nNOSmu translocation in the rat soleus. Removal of mechanical loading (spaceflight, bedrest, casting) causes rapid atrophy of affected skeletal muscles. Recently, we identified that translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSmu) and downstream activation of FoxO3a were redox-sensitive phenomena. Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU-induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber-type shift from slow to fast twitch. Loss of sarcolemmal nNOSmu activity with HU, visualized using NADPH diaphorase and confirmed with immunofluorescence were also mitigated by gp91dsTAT. Gp91dsTAT also attenuated membrane localization of the Nox2 subunit p67phox. We conclude that Nox2 inhibition protects against muscle fiber atrophy and translocation of nNOSmu.",Excluded
2574,"A comparison of radiation exposure between diagnostic CTA and DSA examinations of cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While the number of CTA examinations is continually increasing compared with DSA examinations, there is little comparative dose information about the different imaging techniques. We compared patient radiation exposure resulting from diagnostic CTA and DSA examinations for both cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anthropomorphic phantom was irradiated by using typical diagnostic CTA and DSA setups and imaging parameters. For both imaging techniques, the imaging area of cerebral vessels included intracranial vessels only, while the imaging area of cervicocerebral vessels included both cervical and intracranial vessels from the aortic arch to the vertex. The effective dose was determined by using RPLDs. The DSA examination was simulated by using a biplane angiography system, and the CTA examination, by using a 64-row multidetector CT scanner. RESULT(S): For the imaging of cerebral vessels, the effective dose according to ICRP 103 was 0.67 mSv for CTA and 2.71 mSv for DSA. For the imaging of cervicocerebral vessels, the effective dose was 4.85 mSv for CTA and 3.60 mSv for DSA. The maximum absorbed dose (milligray) for skin, brain, salivary glands, and eyes was 166.2, 73.5, 35.6, and 21.8 mGy for DSA and 19.0, 16.9, 20.4, and 14.8 mGy for CTA, respectively. The conversion factors from DAP and DLP to effective dose were calculated.

633,"Mind over (white)matter: A relationship between client change talk and whitematter integrity?. Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method of applying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the assessment of whitemattermicrostructure. DTI is used tomeasure the directional coherence of water molecules (fractional anisotropy: FA) in white matter fiber bundles in the brain. High FA generally indicates greater axonal diameter, axonal density, & myelination. Fiber bundles including the arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, have been linked to language functions (Frederici & Giheran, in press). Given the theorized role of client language in motivational interviewing (Moyers et al., 2009), and the evidence for dierences in brain activity between types of client change language (Houck et al., in press), the goal of the present study was to examine the correlation between FA and measures of client language from MI treatment sessions for alcohol use. DTI was available from9 subjects (M age = 42.4, SD = 13.5 years). Although change talk counts are linked to treatment outcomes, in the present sample these counts were also correlated with age, which has a strong independent relationship with FA. Instead we evaluated a transition probability extracted from sequential coding of MI sessions: the log-transformed odds ratio for the transition between therapist open questions and client change talk (OQ2CT).With both age and OQ2CT in the model, we observed a trend in right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (p = .24) and anterior thalamic radiation (p = .196), as well as an eect in the left cerebellum (p = .05), each indicating a negative relationship between FA and the odds of responding to an open question with change talk. Work with alcohol dependent individuals shows decreased FA in superior cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Pfeferbaum et al., 2009). More recent research comparing current and remitted AUD suggests that these abnormalities are linked to recent drinking (Monnig et al., 2012). It is unlikely that within-session client speech has an immediate and direct eect upon whitematter integrity. Given the negative correlation in these data, amore plausible explanation is that participants with more severe drinking, and concomitantly greater damage to whitematter, aremore likely to describe negative consequences when asked about their drinking. Research with a larger sample and follow-up assessment is necessary before stronger conclusions can be drawn.",Excluded
1567,"Energy dependence on discharge mode of Izhikevich neuron driven by external stimulus under electromagnetic induction. Energy supply plays a key role in metabolism and signal transmission of biological individuals, neurons in a complex electromagnetic environment must be accompanied by the absorption and release of energy. In this paper, the discharge mode and the Hamiltonian energy are investigated within the Izhikevich neuronal model driven by external signals in the presence of electromagnetic induction. It is found that multiple electrical activity modes can be observed by changing external stimulus, and the Hamiltonian energy is more dependent on the discharge mode. In particular, there is a distinct shift and transition in the Hamiltonian energy when the discharge mode is switched quickly. Furthermore, the amplitude of periodic stimulus signal has a greater effect on the neuronal energy compared to the angular frequency, and the average Hamiltonian energy decreases when the discharge rhythm becomes higher. Based on the principle of energy minimization, the system should choose the minimum Hamiltonian energy when maintaining various trigger states to reduce the metabolic energy of signal processing in biological systems. Therefore, our results give the possible clues for predicting and selecting appropriate parameters, and help to understand the sudden and paroxysmal mechanisms of epilepsy symptoms.

In recent years, numerous studies have reported a weak association between 60 Hz magnetic-field exposure and the incidence of certain cancers. To date, no mechanism to explain these findings has been identified. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure.

109,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats. The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a preradiation chemotherapy regimen in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), with emphasis on long-term outcomes.METHODS: In this prospective phase II trial, patients with a new diagnosis of PCNSL received two cycles of intrathecal (12 mg) and IV (1 g/m2) methotrexate (MTX), thiotepa (30 mg/m2), and procarbazine (75 mg/m2), prior to whole-brain radiotherapy (RT).RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled (ages 26 to 71, median 53). Median Karnofsky performance scale score was 70. After chemotherapy, 7 patients (41%) had a complete response (CR) and 7 (41%) a partial response (PR). After RT, 13 (76%) patients achieved a CR, 2 (12%) a PR, and 2 (12%) had disease progression. Relapse occurred in 7 (41%) patients; median disease-free survival was 18 months. Fifteen (88%) patients have died: 8 (47%) from PCNSL, 5 (29%) from neurotoxicity, and 2 (12%) from unknown causes. Median overall survival was 32 months. Two patients (12%) are alive and disease free at 12 years follow-up. Nephrotoxicity was a minor complication, but grades 3 and 4 myelosuppression were found in 5 (29%) patients.CONCLUSIONS: This regimen resulted in an efficacy and toxicity profile comparable to other combined modality treatments, despite the relatively low dose of methotrexate. It may be a useful option in patients unable to tolerate higher doses.

1295,"Using the combined model of gamma test and neuro-fuzzy system for modeling and estimating lead bonds in reservoir sediments. Heavy metals attract a great deal of attention nowadays due to their potential accumulation in living creatures and transference in the food chain. Sediments of water reservoirs are considered to be a source of accumulation of these metals that develop in response to human activities and soil erosion. This study collected 180 samples of the surface sediments of water reservoir 1 at Chahnimeh in Sistan. Efficiency of the ANFIS model was evaluated to estimate the five bonds following the measurement of parameters in the laboratory. The following results were obtained for the parameters: organic carbon (OC) %, 0.31; cation exchange capacity (CEC), 37.07 Cmol kg; total Pb, 25.19 mg/kg; clay %, 45.87; and silt %, 39.02. These parameters were used as input for the training model. In the output layer, lead bonds were chosen as modeling targets in the following way: Pb f1 (4.61); Pb f2 (0.54); Pb f3 (16.28); Pb f4 (3.42); and Pb f5 (0.38) mg/kg. The best input compound in this model was chosen using the gamma test. From a total of 180, 88 data were considered for the model training section. Eventually, the neural-fuzzy model (subtractive clustering), developed for the prediction of lead bonds in the studied region, was able to account for over 99% of lead bonds in the sediments; considering statistical criteria of root mean squares error or RMSE (0.0337-0.0813) and determination coefficient or R<sup>2</sup> (0.92-0.99), this model showed good performance with regard to prediction.",Excluded
3524,"Retroperitoneal fibrosis: A single center experience with multidisciplinary approach. Introduction and Aims: Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF), also named Ormond's disease, is a rare disease characterized by the presence of inflammation and fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum. it can be idiopathic or associated to neoplasia, systemic disease, drugs and radiation Methods: We describe our cohort composed by 16 patients (11 males). The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.2+/-10.9; 50% were smokers and with history of atopy in 5 of them. Five patients had a cancer (2 cuteneous, 1 hematological, 1 ginecological and 1 neuroendocrine). Diagnosis of RF was made with CT, histology, ultrasonography or MRI (respectively in 10, 3, 2 and 1 patients). Seven patients underwent PET, that showed a pathologic enhancement in retroperitoneal and periaortic lesions. Four patients had an histological diagnosis of IgG4 related disease. Mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Result(s): At the time of the diagnosis, the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 54.2+/-27.6 ml/min and 14 patients had an impaired renal function. Six patients presented also hydroureteronephrosis that worsened the renal function (mean eGFR 32.2+/-16.9), with ureteral stenting requirement. After resolution of ureteral stenosis there was a significant recovery (mean eGFR 56.9+/-23), comparable to the patient that did not required the stent. Only 1 patient required dialysis for hyperpotassemia before positioning ureteral stent. the mean value of plasmatic IgG was 1638+/-1000 mg/dL (normal range 700-1600 mg/dl), resulting high for 5 patients. The mean IgG4 concentration was 391.6+/-585.8 mg/dL, higher than normal range in 50% of patients. For 12 patients we calculated IgG4/IgG ratio, an index suggested by some authors as a potential tool to discriminate patient with RF linked to IgG4 related disease. Three patients had an IgG4/IgG ratio <8% and 9 patients >8%. In our cohort, the IgG4/IgG ratio presented a direct correlation (p=0,009) with extraperitoneal manifestations of the IgG4 related disease, such as pancreatitis, colangitis, encephalitis and ocular involvement. One patient showed modest eosinophilia and almost 43% of patients had positive antinuclear antibodies. C3 and C4 component fractions were low in 2 patients who had highest levels of IgG4 and IgG4/IgG ratio and severe systemic involvement. Erythrosedimentation rate and C-protein reactive were almost normal (respectively mean values 44.8 mm and 1.63 mg/dl). Conclusion(s): almost all of the patients (87,5 %) showed impaired renal function. Kidney involvement did not seem to be linked just to obstructive uropathy. In fact after stenting, eGFR values were comparable in the 2 groups (obstructed vs not-obstructed). Further evaluations are required to better understand the renal impairment and the physiopathology of RF. Our data would suggest that RF might have a direct impact on renal function probably due to igG4 related disease.",Excluded
158,"Computed-tomography-guided transforaminal intrathecal nusinersen injection in adults with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and severe spinal deformity. Feasibility, safety and radiation exposure considerations. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate our centre's experience on computed-tomography-guided (CT-guided), transforaminal, intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adult subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 and severe spinal deformity.METHOD: This is a retrospective, single-centre study investigating the feasibility and safety of CT-guided, transforaminal, lumbar puncture for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen (Spinranza R; Biogen; Cambridge, MA, USA) in a cohort of adult subjects with SMA type 2, severe neuromuscular scoliosis and previous spinal surgery. Between January 2019 and October 2019, five male, adult, SMA type 2 subjects were eligible to be treated in our centre with nusinersen. The mean age of the patients was 31 +/- 9 years (range 19-43 years). The study's outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and radiation exposure.RESULTS: In total, four patients completed the four loading doses, whilst the fifth patient received only one loading dose; two patients also received their first maintenance doses. Overall, 20 consecutive transforaminal, intrathecal treatments were analysed. Technical success was 100% (20/20 intrathecal infusions). No adverse events were documented following the procedures. Mean dose-length product (DLP) value per injection was 665.4 +/- 715.5 mGy*cm. Estimated mean effective dose per injection was 12.7 +/- 12.9 mSv. Subgroup analysis between the chronologically first 10 versus subsequent 10 procedures demonstrated a clear trend towards less radiation exposure in the latter, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (DLP: 984.7 +/- 903.3 vs. 436.7 +/- 321.5 mGy*cm, P = 0.165; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, CT-guided transforaminal access for intrathecal injection of nusinersen was proven feasible and safe. A decrease in radiation dose over time was noted. Protocols to minimize radiation exposure are essential.",Excluded

The clinical application of chemotherapeutics for brain tumors remains a challenge due to limitation of blood-brain barrier/blood-tumor barrier (BBB/BTB). In this study, we investigated the effects of low-dose focused ultrasound hyperthermia (UH) on the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) for brain metastasis of breast cancer. Murine breast cancer cells (4T1-luc2) expressing firefly luciferase were implanted into mouse striatum as a brain tumor model. The mice were intravenously injected with PLD with/without transcranial pulsed-wave/continuous-wave UH (pUH/cUH) treatment on day-6 after tumor implantation. pUH (frequency: 500 kHz, PRF: 1000 Hz, duty cycle: 50%) was conducted under equal acoustic power (2.2-Watt) and sonication duration (10-min) as cUH. The amounts of doxorubicin accumulated in the normal brain and tumor tissues were measured with fluorometry. The tumor growth responses for the control, pUH, PLD, PLD + cUH, and PLD + pUH groups were evaluated with IVIS. The PLD distribution and cell apoptosis were assessed with immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that pUH significantly enhanced the PLD delivery into brain tumors and the tumor growth was further inhibited by PLD + pUH without damaging the sonicated normal brain tissues. This indicates that low-dose transcranial pUH is a promising method to selectively enhance nanodrug delivery and improve the brain tumor treatment. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

3056,"Increased risk of ischemic stroke in young nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. PURPOSE: Radiation/chemoradiotherapy-induced carotid stenosis and cerebrovascular events in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) can cause severe disability and even death. This study aimed to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in this patient population over more than 10 years of follow-up.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohorts consisted of all patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of NPC (n=1094), whereas patients hospitalized for an appendectomy during 1997 and 1998 (n=4376) acted as the control group and surrogate for the general population. Cox proportional hazard model was performed as a means of comparing the stroke-free survival rate between the two cohorts after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 292 patients with ischemic strokes, 62 (5.7%) were from the NPC cohort and 230 (5.3%) were from the control group. NPC patients ages 35-54 had a 1.66 times (95% CI, 1.16-2.86; p=0.009) higher risk of ischemic stroke after adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, geographic region, urbanization level of residence, and socioeconomic status. There was no statistical difference in ischemic stroke risk between the NPC patients and appendectomy patients ages 55-64 years (hazard ratio=0.87; 95% CI, 0.56-1.33; p=0.524) after adjusting for other factors.CONCLUSIONS: Young NPC patients carry a higher risk for ischemic stroke than the general population.

3508,"A pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein mediates the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor inhibition of melatonin release in photoreceptive chick pineal cell cultures. The avian pineal gland is a photoreceptive organ that has been shown to contain postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors that inhibit melatonin synthesis and/or release upon receptor activation. Physiological response and [32P]ADP ribosylation experiments were performed to investigate whether pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) were involved in the transduction of the alpha 2-adrenergic signal. For physiological response studies, the effects of pertussis toxin on melatonin release in dissociated cell cultures exposed to norepinephrine were assessed. Pertussis toxin blocked alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin-induced blockade appeared to be noncompetitive. One and 10 ng/ml doses of pertussis toxin partially blocked and a 100 ng/ml dose completely blocked norepinephrine-induced inhibition. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of G-proteins in chick pineal cell membranes was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Membranes were prepared from cells that had been pretreated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. In the absence of pertussis toxin pretreatment, two major proteins of 40K and 41K mol wt (Mr) were labeled by [32P]NAD. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of pineal cells abolished [32P] radiolabeling of the 40K Mr G-protein in a dose-dependent manner. The norepinephrine-induced inhibition of both cAMP efflux and melatonin release, as assessed by RIA of medium samples collected before membrane preparation, was also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by pertussis toxin. Collectively, these results suggest that a pertussis toxin-sensitive 40K Mr G-protein labeled by [32P]NAD may be functionally associated with alpha 2-adrenergic signal transduction in chick pineal cells.",Excluded
1741,"The zebrafish galectin Drgal1-l2 is expressed by proliferating Muller glia and photoreceptor progenitors and regulates the regeneration of rod photoreceptors. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify secreted proteins in the retina of the adult zebrafish that are induced by the selective death of photoreceptors and to test experimentally the function of these proteins during the regeneration of photoreceptors.METHODS: Induced selective death of photoreceptors in the retina of the adult zebrafish was combined with in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to identify the induced cellular expression of the secreted beta-galactoside binding protein Galectin 1-like 2 (Drgal1-L2). Electroporation of morpholino oligonucleotides was used to knock down protein synthesis, and regenerated photoreceptors were counted in control and experimental retinas after labeling with cell type-specific RNA probes.RESULTS: Expression analysis and immunocytochemistry showed that Drgal1-L2 is induced de novo by photoreceptor death and is synthesized by microglia and proliferating Muller glia and their mitotic progeny. Knockdown of Drgal1-L2 expression in Muller glia results in reduced regeneration of rod photoreceptors without affecting injury-induced proliferation or the regeneration of cone photoreceptors.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, the authors conclude that Drgal1-L2 is induced by photoreceptor cell death and secreted by stem cells and neuronal progenitors and that it regulates the regeneration of rod photoreceptors. Drgal1-L2 is the first secreted factor shown to regulate aspects of regenerative neurogenesis in the teleost retina.",Excluded

To investigate whether cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), CDDP) causes resistance we pretreated C6 cells with 10(-6) M CDDP for 24 hours and then tested their sensitivity in a colorimetric assay. Pretreated cells developed resistance to CDDP (resistance factor 2.0) and radiation (survival after 9 Gy 60Co: 36.4% +/- 5.5 versus 28.6% +/- 5.2, p = 0.005).

Optogenetics is widely used to control diverse cellular functions with light, requiring experimenters to expose cells to bright light. Because extended exposure to visible light can be toxic to cells, it is important to characterize the effects of light stimulation on cellular function in the absence of optogenetic proteins. Here we exposed mouse cortical cultures with no exogenous optogenetic proteins to several hours of flashing blue, red, or green light. We found that exposing these cultures to as short as 1 h of blue light, but not red or green light, results in an increase in the expression of neuronal activity-regulated genes. Our findings suggest that blue light stimulation is ill suited to long-term optogenetic experiments, especially those that measure transcription, and they emphasize the importance of performing light-only control experiments in samples without optogenetic proteins.",Excluded
2849,"Classifying the risk of ionizing radiation exposure after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Learning Objectives: We hypothesized that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) could be classified by their risk of receiving potentially harmful ionizing radiation exposure (PHIRE) from diagnostic tests and medical procedures. Method(s): The EMR of all patients admitted to our institution with aSAH from 01/2012-12/2015 were retrospectively evaluated using an IRB-approved protocol for patient-specific and disease-specific data. Patients were excluded if they died prior to discharge. Total effective dose of ionizing radiation (TEDIR) was calculated from published data. PHIRE was considered to have occurred in patients with TEDIR> 50 mSV, the annual radiation exposure limit for radiation workers. A multivariate classification tree was created to predict PHIRE risk groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk of PHIRE between the risk groups. Result(s): Data were collected from 108 aSAH patients. The mean TEDIR was 47.8 mSv. After development of the multivariate classification tree, the tree was pruned to include only ventriculostomy (EVD), Hunt/Hess score (HH), and aneurysm location, according to normal statistical conventions. Patients who did not have an ventriculostomy (EVD) were at low risk for PHIRE (N = 2/35, (5.7%)). Patients with an EVD + HH 2 + anterior circulation aneurysms were at moderate risk for PHIRE (N = 17/42, 40.5%). (OR = 11.2, p = 0.002). Patients with an EVD + HH < 2 or EVD + HH 2 + posterior circulation aneurysms were at high risk for PHIRE (N = 23/31, 74.2%) (OR = 47.4, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this study, aSAH patients were categorized into low, moderate and high risk groups of PHIRE according to three factors: EVD, HH, and aneurysm location. These groups likely represent differential baseline neurologic status and risk of neurologic complications. Alternative diagnostic or therapeutic modalities should be utilized, when possible, for patients in the high-risk group and should be considered for patients in the moderate-risk group. Future research should validate these risk groups in larger patient samples and across multiple medical centers.",Excluded
338,"Somastatin receptor (SSTR2) in canine meningioma: Preliminary results of immunohistochemical and qrt-PCR investigations. The neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) plays an important regulatory role in the proliferation of both normal and neoplastic cells. Five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) have been identified in several human tumours, including meningioma. The receptor most commonly identified is the SSTR2a subtype. Long half-life somatostatin analogues (i.e. octreotide) are today included in chemotherapy schedules for unresectable or radiation-refractory recurrent human meningiomas. The aim of this study is to test the expression of SSTR2a in canine meningioma by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analyses. Twenty-one FFPE meningiomas were used for IHC investigations performed with rabbit anti-human SSTR2 antibody (1:500, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. For each tumour, area of labeling was assessed in five grades, ranging from (-) = absent to (++++) = > 75% of tumour. Twenty-five meningiomas were also submitted to qRT-PCR investigations performed with Taqman probe (Life Technologies). Total RNA was extracted from 5 mum sections of FFPE tissue with FFPE-RNA Purification Kit (Norgen), and mRNA was reversetranscribed with iScript cDNA synthesis (Bio-rad). At IHC, SSTR2a was expressed in 17/21 cases (81%) showing a diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreaction. The most common histotypes, including meningothelial, fibroblastic, and transitional meningiomas as well as the papillary meningiomas were positive, ranging from (+) to (++++). Grade I, grade II and grade III expressed SSTR2 in 86%, 91%, and 33%, respectively. The PCR-amplification tests gave positive results in the majority of the canine meningiomas.

1408,"The sensitivity of light-evoked responses of retinal ganglion cells is decreased in nitric oxide synthase gene knockout mice. We have shown previously that increasing the production of nitric oxide (NO) results in a dampening of visual responses of retinal ganglion cells (G. Y. Wang, L. C. Liets, & L. M. Chalupa, 2003). To gain further insights into the role of NO in retinal function, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from ganglion cells of neural type nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene knockout mice. Here we show that in the dark-adapted state, the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cell to light stimulation is decreased in nNOS knockout animals. The lowest light intensities required to evoke optimal responses and the average intensities that evoked half-maximal responses were significantly higher in nNOS knockouts than in normal mice. Retinal histology and other features of light-evoked responses of ganglion cells in nNOS mice appeared to be indistinguishable from those of normal mice. Collectively, these results, in conjunction with our previous work, provide evidence that increasing levels of NO dampen visual responses of ganglion cells, while a lack of nNOS decreases the sensitivity of these neurons to light. Thus, NO levels in the retina are capable of modulating the information that ganglion cells convey to the visual centers of the brain.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare dose values specified at the reference point, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, ICRU, and the mean dose to the planning target volume, PTV.MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT-based dose calculations were performed with a 3-D treatment planning system for 6 series of patients treated for bladder, brain, breast, lung, oropharynx and parotid gland tumour. All patients were arbitrarily chosen from a set of previously treated patients irradiated with a two- or three-field technique using customised blocks. Appropriate wedge angles and beam weights were chosen to make the dose distribution as homogeneous as possible.RESULTS: The dose at the ICRU reference point was generally higher than the mean dose to the PTV. The difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV for an individual patient was less than 3% in 88% of cases and less than 2% in 72% of the cases. The differences were larger in those patients where the dose distribution is significantly influenced by the presence of lungs or air gaps. For each series of patients the mean difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV was calculated. The difference between these two values never exceeded 2%. Because not all planning systems are able to calculate the mean dose to the PTV, the concept of the mean central dose, the mean of the dose values at the centre of the PTV in each CT slice, has been introduced. The mean central dose was also calculated for the same patients and was closer to the mean dose to the PTV than the ICRU reference dose.CONCLUSION: The mean dose to the PTV is well estimated by either the ICRU reference dose or the mean central dose for a variety of treatment techniques for common types of cancer.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE Seizures are the second-most common presenting symptom in patients with lobar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control. METHODS Patients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up. RESULTS Seizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief. Copyright © AANS 2019",Excluded

Introduction: Orientin is a water-soluble flavonoid C-glycoside which is isolable from Ocimum sanctum. It has been suggested to have antioxidant, antiviral, vasodilatation, cardioprotective, radiation protective effect, neuroprotective effect and to be able to cross blood-brain-barrier. Thus, it is a potential treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Furthermore, oxidative stress has been highly implicated in the progression of ND, hence, this leads to the study on Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway for the targeted effective therapies of ND in the future. Objective(s): To determine the effects of orientin on nitric oxide levels, intracellular calcium levels and the mechanism by which orientin protects SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage. Method(s): Orientin at pre-determined maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD), 20 muM and half MNTD (O MNTD), 10muM were subjected to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h, followed by 150 muM of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> oxidative induction for 24 h at 37degreeC.

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively examine the outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy in three to five fractions for vestibular schwannomas.METHODS: Twenty-five patients with 26 vestibular schwannomas were treated with hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy using a CyberKnife. The vestibular schwannomas of 5 patients were associated with type II neurofibromatosis. The median follow-up time was 80 months (range: 6-167); the median planning target volume was 2.6 cm(3) (0.3-15.4); and the median prescribed dose (>=D90) was 21 Gy in three fractions (18-25 Gy in three to five fractions). Progression was defined as >=2 mm 3-dimensional post-treatment tumor enlargement excluding transient expansion. Progression or any death was counted as an event in progression-free survival rates, whereas only progression was counted in progression-free rates.RESULTS: The 7-year progression-free survival and progression-free rates were 78 and 95%, respectively. Late adverse events (>=3 months) with grades based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.03 were observed in 6 patients: Grade 3 hydrocephalus in one patient, Grade 2 facial nerve disorders in two and Grade 1-2 tinnitus in three. In total, 12 out of 25 patients maintained pure tone averages <=50 dB before hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, and 6 of these 12 patients (50%) maintained pure tone averages at this level at the final audiometric follow-up after hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy.

Although surgery remains the treatment of choice in patients with recurrent hemorrhage, patients with CCMs located in the brainstem are in many cases not eligible for resection due to high procedure-related morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the long-term outcome of LINAC radiosurgery (LINAC-RS) for the treatment of brainstem CCMs.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1992 and March 2008, 14 patients (6 men, 8 women) harboring brainstem CCMs underwent LINAC-RS. Pretreatment neuroimaging showed no associated developmental venous angiomas (DVAs) in any of our patients. Prior to treatment, all patients suffered at least from one symptomatic hemorrhage (median 1.8, range 1-3). A median follow-up of 7.1 years (range 2.0-16.8 years) could be obtained in 12 patients. We applied a median tumor surface dose of 13.9 Gy (range 11-18 Gy; median tumor volume 1.6 ml, range 0.4-4.3 ml).RESULTS: Following LINAC-RS, neurological outcome improved in 4 (33.3%) and remained unchanged in 8 patients (66.7%). Rebleeding with subsequent transient neurological status deterioration occurred in 4 patients (33.3%), leading to additional surgical resection in 2 patients (16.7%). The corresponding annual hemorrhage rate was 4.8% (4/82.8 patient-years). Adverse radiation effects (ARE, defined by perilesional hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images) were revealed in 3 patients (25%), leading to transient neurological deficits in 2 patients (16.7%). There were no procedure-related complications leading to either permanent morbidity or mortality.CONCLUSION: Our results support the role of LINAC-RS as an efficient and safe treatment to significantly reduce the annual hemorrhage rate in patients suffering from brainstem CCMs not eligible to microsurgery. Compared with radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the intervention-related morbidity is higher.",Excluded
1249,"Lack of promoting effects of chronic exposure to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 cellular system on development of N-ethylnitrosourea-induced central nervous system tumors in F344 rats. The present study was performed to evaluate effects of a 2-year exposure to an electromagnetic near-field (EMF) equivalent to that generated by cellular phones on tumor development in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats. For this purpose, pregnant F344 rats were given a single administration of N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on gestational day 18. A total of 500 pups were divided into five groups, each composed of 50 males and 50 females: Group 1, untreated controls; Group 2, ENU alone; Groups 3 to 5, ENU + EMF (sham exposure and two exposure levels). A 1.95-GHz wide-band code division multiple access (W-CDMA) signal, which is a feature of the International Mobile Telecommunication 2000 (IMT-2000) cellular system was employed for exposure of the rat head starting from 5 weeks of age, 90 min a day, 5 days a week, for 104 weeks. Brain average specific absorption rates (SARs) were designed to be .67 and 2.0 W/kg for low and high exposures, respectively. The incidence and numbers of brain tumors in female rats exposed to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals showed tendencies to increase but without statistical significance. Overall, no significant increase in incidences or numbers, either in the males or females, was detected in the EMF-exposed groups. In addition, no clear changes in tumor types in the brain were evident. Thus, under the present experimental conditions, exposure of heads of rats to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 for a 2-year period was not demonstrated to accelerate or otherwise affect ENU-initiated brain tumorigenesis.",Excluded

93,"Mutagenesis at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci in haploid UV-sensitive strains of Neurospora crassa. V. Comparison of dose--response curves of single- and double-mutant strains with wild-type. The interactions of mutant alleles that individually confer radiation sensitivity in Neurospora crassa are being studied with regard to their effects on radiation-induced inactivation and forward-mutation induction at the ad-3 loci. This paper reports attempts to construct 3 double-mutant strains containing the following pair-wise combinations of repair-deficient mutants: upr-1,uvs-2; uvs-2,uvs-6; and uvs-3,uvs-6. The double-mutant strain with the 2 excision-repair-deficient mutants upr-1 and uvs-2 shows increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced mutagenesis and inactivation, relative to that shown by either of the parental single-mutant strains. This double mutant is no more sensitive than the parental single-mutant strains to either UV mutagenesis or inactivation. The combination of the uvs-2 and uvs-6 double-mutant strain is considerably more sensitive to both UV and X-ray inactivation than either the uvs-2 or uvs-6 strain, but it shows no greater sensitivity than the parental strains to ad-3 mutation induction by either agent. The combination of the uvs-3 and uvs-6 alleles is inviable. Tetrad analysis and microscopical examination of ascospores shows that ascospores of presumptive genotype uvs-3, uvs-6 do not grow beyond the formation of a few hyphal threads. The lethal and mutagenic effects of UV and X-irradiation in these double-mutant strains are interpreted in terms of the repair systems in Neurospora and other microorganisms.",Excluded
2187,"Sparing of cochleae and eyes in whole brain radiation therapy with boost by helical tomotherapy and noncoplanar VMAT. Purpose/Objective: Simple low conformity lateral opposing radiation beams with limited sparing to proximal organs-atrisk (OARs) were widely adopted in the past for treating palliative whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Crucial OARs located at skull base used to sacrifice with significant radiation dose inevitably. More conformal radiation treatments, like helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), are becoming more accepted to treat WBRT. These techniques allow not only conformal dose to the whole brain but also simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) doses to dedicated metastases for superior disease control and symptom relief. This study aimed to investigate any potential advantages in cochleae and eyes sparing between HT and non-coplanar VMAT. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 15 brain metastasis patients who had received palliative dose WBRTs with SIBs to the metastases in the department were recruited. Each patient was re-planned with HT and non-coplanar VMAT for dosimetric comparison. Departmental routine optimal settings with fan beam thickness of 2.5cm and pitch value of 0.287 were used in all HT plans. One coplanar full arc plus two non-coplanar half arcs modulating by Varian Millennium 120 MLCs were used in all VMAT plans. The two non-coplanar half arcs were arranged at 60 degrees offset to each other and to the coplanar full arc to cover the cranial hemisphere. All target volumes were optimized according to original prescriptions. The median whole brain dose was 30Gy (range 25-40Gy) and the median SIB dose was 35Gy (range 30-45Gy). The mean SIB volume was 26.7+/-30.4cc consisting 1.7+/-1.8% of the whole brain volume 1481.8+/-161.1cc. Radiation doses to cochleae and eyes were studied by comparing their maximum doses (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean). The dose results from the two techniques were tested statistically by paired t-test considering significant level of p-value <0.05. Result(s): The dose results are listed in Table 1. Non-coplanar VMAT significantly achieved lower Dmax and Dmean to both cochleae than HT (all p<0.001). Radiation doses to both eyes were slightly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT but could not be shown statistically significant (all p>0.05). However, the Dmax and Dmean to both lens were significantly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): Non-coplanar VMAT is superior to HT in sparing cochleae which are relatively small and highly proximal to target volumes. There is no significant dose difference in eyes sparing for both techniques. Non-coplanar VMAT is preferred to treat WBRT with SIB if slight increase in lens doses is not a concern.

1586,"Combination of TMS and fMRI reveals a specific pattern of reorganization in M1 in patients after complete spinal cord injury. PURPOSE: After a spinal cord injury (SCI), which was complete, deafferentation of the body representation caudal to the lesion height results in drastic changes in the cortical representation. The underlaying processes are poorly understood.METHODS: We investigated cortical representation sites of upper limb muscles using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in five patients suffering from thoracic complete SCI and one with an incomplete SCI in the height of L1.RESULTS: In comparison to healthy controls fMRI demonstrated a displacement of elbow movement representations in the precentral gyrus in patients with complete SCI into the direction of the deafferented cortical thoracic representation. Changes increased with time after the incidence of SCI. TMS revealed reduced excitability and prolonged silent periods for muscles more distant to the deafferented area.CONCLUSIONS: Whereas fMRI demonstrated changes in representation sites adjacent to the deafferented area, TMS excitability changes were also observed more distant to the deafferented area and silent periods were prolonged in comparison to healthy controls. TMS changes might depend on both: the distance to the deafferented area and the time of persistence of deafferentation.",Excluded
2008,"Evaluation of metastases in the submandibular gland in head and neck malignancy. BACKGROUND: : Either excision of the submandibular gland during neck dissection or having the submandibular gland in radiation field can result in xerostomia, leading to reduced quality of life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of metastasis to the submandibular gland and to identify potential risk factors leading to the presence of metastases into the gland.PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Of 376 patients with head and neck malignancy who were treated between 1999 and 2008, 130 patients underwent a neck dissection, and in total, 171 submandibular glands were removed. The average age was 61.1 years.RESULTS: : Twenty-three patients (17.7%) revealed some type of pathology in the submandibular gland such as chronic sialadenitis (15), atrophy (5), tumor infiltration (5), and intraglandular lymph node (1). In the group with sialadenitis, the mean age was 57.7 years. Forty-four percent had a pretreatment (radiation, 9%; local resection, 13%; or combined therapy, 22%) before neck dissection. Of the sialadenitis group, 9 of 12 patients had the primary tumor in the lower jaw, floor of mouth, or tongue.CONCLUSIONS: : One needs to be aware of the possibility of occult metastases in level I in oral cavity carcinomas, whereas oropharynx carcinoma constitutes a lower risk for involvement of lymph node metastases at level I. The excision of the submandibular gland should be performed in cases with positive lymph nodes at level I and in tumor sites with a high risk of occult metastasis at level I.",Excluded
985,"The role of PET in target localization for radiotherapy treatment planning. Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently accepted as an important tool in oncology, mostly for diagnosis, staging and restaging purposes. It provides a new type of information in radiotherapy, functional rather than anatomical. PET imaging can also be used for target volume definition in radiotherapy treatment planning. The need for very precise target volume delineation has arisen with the increasing use of sophisticated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques and intensity modulated radiation therapy. It is expected that better delineation of the target volume may lead to a significant reduction in the irradiated volume, thus lowering the risk of treatment complications (smaller safety margins). Better tumour visualisation also allows a higher dose of radiation to be applied to the tumour, which may lead to better tumour control. The aim of this article is to review the possible use of PET imaging in the radiotherapy of various cancers. We focus mainly on non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and oesophageal cancer, but also include current opinion on the use of PET-based planning in other tumours including brain, uterine cervix, rectum and prostate.

Stimulation of specific neurons expressing opsins in a targeted region to manipulate brain function has proved to be a powerful tool in neuroscience. However, the use of visible light for optogenetic stimulation is invasive due to low penetration depth and tissue damage owing to larger absorption and scattering. Here, we report, for the first time, in-depth non-scanning fiber-optic two-photon optogenetic stimulation (FO-TPOS) of neurons in-vivo in transgenic mouse models. In order to optimize the deep-brain stimulation strategy, we characterized two-photon activation efficacy at different near-infrared laser parameters. The significantly-enhanced in-depth stimulation efficiency of FO-TPOS as compared to conventional single-photon beam was demonstrated both by experiments and Monte Carlo simulation. The non-scanning FO-TPOS technology will lead to better understanding of the in-vivo neural circuitry because this technology permits more precise and less invasive anatomical delivery of stimulation.",Excluded
1319,"Assessment of treatment response of concurrent pulsed radiotherapy (PRT) and temozolomide by micropet/CT in a murine orthotopic model of glioblastoma multiforme. Purpose/Objective: Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors that are highly resistant to therapy. While conventional radiation therapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ) has improved median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months, the majority of patients succumb to this disease due to local failure. To overcome this resistance, we evaluated the efficacy of pulsed low-dose radiotherapy (PRT) combined with TMZ as a novel treatment strategy, and evaluated efficacy using 18F-FDG muPET/CT imaging and immunohistochemistry. Materials/Methods: Intracranial tumors were established by injecting U87 GBM cells in Nu-Foxn1nu mice using a stereotactic device. Tumor burden was determined by contrast-enhanced muCT and these volumes were applied to 18F-FDG muPET data to evaluate tumor metabolic activity (SUVmax). Six treatment groups were evaluated; 1) control 2) TMZ alone 3) RT alone 4) PRT alone 5) RT+TMZ 6) PRT+TMZ. Tumors were irradiated 7-10 days post-implantation to a total dose of 14 Gy over 7 consecutive days. Radiation was delivered using either a single 2 Gy dose/day (RT) or 10 pulses of 0.2 Gy with an inter-pulse interval of 3 minutes (PRT), to the same total daily dose of 2 Gy. TMZ (10mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1 hr prior to daily RT or PRT treatment. At sacrifice, tumors were harvested for immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TMZ (10mg/kg) produced a modest growth delay of 2 weeks compared with controls (p<0.05). Compared to TMZ alone, combining TMZ with RT or PRT resulted in an additional 3-4 week growth delay (p<0.01). PRT+TMZ also resulted in a larger decline in SUVmax after treatment than RT+TMZ (p=0.01), but the SUVmax rebounded for each group during regrowth. Less normal brain damage, as assessed by Nissl staining, was seen after PRT+TMZ as compared with RT+TMZ (p<0.01). Levels of tumor apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferation (Ki67) and recruitment of CD45+/F4/80+ macrophages to the invasive tumor margins were similar for both the RT+TMZ and the PRT+TMZ treated groups. Significantly, CD45+/CD133+ bone marrow-derived cells were only seen in the hypoxic regions of tumors treated with TMZ alone or RT+/-TMZ, and not in tumors that that received PRT+/-TMZ. Conclusion(s): PRT+TMZ proved to be the most efficacious treatment, with diminished normal tissue side effects, as compared to the other treatment groups. Although the overall rate of tumor regrowth was similar after PRT+TMZ and RT+TMZ, PRT+TMZ produced a more effective initial response as determined by tumor volume and SUVmax. Interestingly, while normal tissue sparing with PRT was expected, the recruitment of the CD45+/CD133+ subpopulation of bone marrow-derived monocytic lineage cells to the hypoxic regions of other groups was unanticipated. These CD45+/CD133+ cells may ultimately be responsible for a microenvironment that causes faster regrowth. However, since the PRT-TMZ treated tumors regrew without CD45+/CD133+ cell recruitment, this suggests that there is an alternative pathway, and/or associated cell types, that are responsible for post-treatment tumor progression. This pathway may present an additional novel target for inhibition in multimodal treatment strategies for GBM.",Excluded

Gastrointestinal side-effects dominate during both chemo- and radiotherapy, with the risk of severe haematological, infectious and thromboembolic complications during chemotherapy. Long-term sequelae comprise second cancers, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality and gonadal dysfunction. Nevertheless, 70% of patients who attempt paternity after treatment are successful. About 20% of patients develop long-term neuro- and/or ototoxicity. The long-term quality of life of survivors of testicular cancer is comparable to that of controls. Risk-adapted treatment of patients with testicular cancer and adequate follow-up of those at risk of life-threatening toxicity are ways to reduce the short- and long-term morbidity in survivors. Patients should be informed about these potential complications and the importance of adjusting their lifestyle (e.g. smoking habits, physical activity and weight control).

3398,"Effects on the nervous system by exposure to electromagnetic fields: experimental and clinical studies. Exposure to electromagnetic fields may cause various types of effects on nervous tissue, in severe cases even irreversible damage. The exposure conditions, i.e. frequency including type and extent of modulation, time, intensity, wave form, as well as shape, size and position of exposed subject and possible treatment with drugs, are factors determining if damage, acute or chronic, ultimately result. Long term exposure of newborn rabbits, rats and mice to electromagnetic fields of power frequency (10-14 kV/m; 50 or 60 Hz; sinusoidal wave form; 21-24 h per day) may cause affection and even damage to the nervous system. Large nerve cells showed reactive changes such as lamellar bodies and cytoskeletal alteration to an extent varying with exposure conditions. Reactive neuroglial changes as well as increase in neuroglial marker proteins could concomitantly be demonstrated. The changes seemed to be reversible although we only have incomplete data available. Exposure in vitro of frog sciatic nerve to 16-60 Hz sinusoidal low current (50-1000 nA) for 17 h induced cytoskeletal changes. Exposure of rabbits to pulsed microwaves of moderate to high intensity (3.1 GHz; 300 Hz modulation; peak duration 1.4 usec with maximal peak intensity about 1000 times average; 55 mW/cm; SAR in the brain cortex about 20 W/kg; increase of temperature as measured by lightguide-equipped instruments in right brain hemisphere about 1-2 degrees C) during 1 h per day during three days resulted in no obvious initial changes in behaviour. Minimal acute dam- age could be demonstrated. However, after two to four months and later on both structural, immunohistochemical and biochemical changes could be documented. Radar technicians accidently and/or occupationally exposed to microwaves showed psychoneurological signs of affection as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid protein pattern. No related changes have been noticed among matched controls.

560,"[The stimulating impact of light on brain cognition function]. Light regulates multiple non-visual circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral functions, and conveys a strong stimulating signal for alert-ness and cognition. This review summarizes a series of neuroimaging studies investigating the brain mechanisms underlying the latter stimulating impact of light. Results of these studies are compatible with a scenario where light would first hit subcortical areas involved in arousal regulation before affecting cortical areas involved in the ongoing non-visual cognitive process, and then cognitive performance. Recent data demonstrated that the non-visual impact of light is most likely triggered via outputs from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which are maximally sensitive to blue light. In addition, the stimulating impact of light is intimately related to wakefulness regulation as it changes with circadian phase and sleep pressure. Finally, markers of inter-individual difference have also been described: age, PERIOD3 genotype, and psychiatric status. This review emphasizes the importance of light for human brain cognitive function and for cognition in general.",Excluded
444,"Technical and dosimetric considerations in multi-isocenter intensity modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with small multileaf collimator. Multileaf collimator (MLC)-assisted intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has greatly improved the target coverage and avoidance of organs at risk (OAR) for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma; however, its implementation is also constrained by the features of the MLC. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to have a large gross target volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) due to its biological characteristics. More than one isocenter may be needed when small MLCs (i.e., BrainLAB M3, whose largest field is 10 x 10 cm(2)) are used to treat the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The BrainLAB IMRT system was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-isocenter IMRT plan for treating nasopharyngeal cancers. Dose coverage of GTVs and CTVs were compared among IMRT plans with 1, 2 and 3 isocenters, as were dose objectives for OARs including brainstem, cord, and parotids. The dosimetric variation and the delivery time were also measured with a phantom. IMRT plans with more than 1 isocenter achieved a better dose coverage, homogeneity, and conformity on GTVs and CTVs; however, with risk of higher doses given to OARs. In most cases, one can generate satisfactory IMRT plans using the 2-isocenter IMRT planning strategy.

2018,"Treg/Tcon Immunotherapy and High Dose Marrow Irradiation Ensure Full Control of Leukemia Relapse in Haploidentical Transplantation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most powerful therapy for patients with high risk of relapse. In spite of that, no matter the donor source or conditioning regimen used, leukemia relapse is still the leading cause of HSCT failure. In HLA-haploidentical HSCT, we recently applied a clinical protocol consisting of total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen and a peripheral blood CD34+ cell graft combined with the adoptive transfer of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and conventional T cells (Tcons). No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. Such protocol was associated with low GvHD and relapse rate (Martelli et al., Blood 2014). To further reduce leukemia relapse in Treg/Tcon-based haploidentical HSCT (Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT) we used high dose hyper-fractionated TBI (HF-TBI) in the conditioning regimen. We also extended Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT to patients that are unfit (because of previous comorbidities) and/or too old to withstand high intensity regimens. In these patients the extra-hematologic toxicity of irradiation was reduced with the use of targeted total marrow and lymph node irradiation (TMLI). 40 patients with high risk acute leukemia (36 AML, 4 ALL) received Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT. All but 3 patients were transplanted in complete remission. 12 younger patients (median age: 28, range: 20-43) received HF-TBI, while 28 older or unfit patients (59, 40-70) received TMLI in the conditioning regimen. HF-TBI (14.4 Gy) was administered in 12 fractions, 3 times a day for 4 days. TMLI was administered by means of Helical Tomotherapy HI-ART (9 fractions, 2 times a day for 4.5 days). Irradiation was followed by chemotherapy with Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Cyclophosphamide. 2 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg freshly isolated CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs were transferred 4 days before the infusion of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg Tcons and a mega-dose of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. 38/40 patients engrafted. 12 (31%) developed aGvHD grade 32 (10 are alive and off-therapy). 6 (16%) died because of transplant related complications (2 because of aGvHD, 2 infections, 1 veno-occlusive disease, 1 intracranial hemorrhage). Strikingly, despite the high risk diseases, no patient relapsed after a median follow up of 13 months (range 1-36, Fig. A). Further, only 1 patient developed cGvHD. Thus, cGvHD/Leukemia-free survival was 82% (Fig. B). Treg adoptive transfer allows for the safe infusion of an otherwise lethal dose of donor alloreactive Tcons in the absence of any other form of immune suppression. Our results demonstrate that the potent graft versus leukemia effect of Treg/Tcon adoptive transfer was boosted by high dose marrow irradiation. Thus, this study proves that the right combination of haploidentical Treg/Tcon immunotherapy plus a powerful conditioning regimen can fully eradicate leukemia. Copyright © 2018",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation.

Current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and its function for memory formation in the behaving animal is limited. NMDAR-independent LTP in the CA1 region is thought to require activity of postsynaptic L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Cav1.x), but the underlying channel isoform remains unknown. We evaluated the function of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel for spatial learning, synaptic plasticity, and triggering of learning-associated biochemical processes using a mouse line with an inactivation of the CACNA1C (Cav1.2) gene in the hippocampus and neocortex (Cav1.2(HCKO)). This model shows (1) a selective loss of protein synthesis-dependent NMDAR-independent Schaffer collateral/CA1 late-phase LTP (L-LTP), (2) a severe impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and (3) decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and reduced cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent transcription in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results provide strong evidence for a role of L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent, NMDAR-independent hippocampal L-LTP in the formation of spatial memory in the behaving animal and for a function of the MAPK/CREB (CRE-binding protein) signaling cascade in linking Cav1.2 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx to either process.",Excluded

Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to increase arthrodesis rates after lumbar spine fusion surgery, but there are minimal data concerning the effect of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. Purpose(s): To determine the efficacy and safety of PEMF stimulation as an adjunct to arthrodesis after ACDF in patients with potential risk factors for nonunion. Study design: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial. Patient Sample: Three hundred and twenty-three patients with radiographic evidence (computed tomography-myelogram [CT-myelo] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of a compressed cervical nerve root and symptomatic radiculopathy appropriate to the compressed root that had failed to respond to nonoperative management were enrolled in the study. The patients were either smokers (more than one pack per day) and/or were undergoing multilevel fusions. All patients underwent ACDF using the Smith-Robinson technique. Allograft bone and an anterior cervical plate were used in all cases. Outcome measures: Measurements were obtained preoperatively and at each postoperative interval and included neurologic assessment, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for shoulder/arm pain at rest and with activity, SF-12 scores, the neck disability index (NDI), and radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension views). Two orthopedic surgeons not otherwise affiliated with the study and blinded to treatment group evaluated the radiographs, as did a blinded radiologist. Adverse events were reported by all patients throughout the study to determine device safety. Method(s): Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving PEMF stimulation after surgery (PEMF group, 163 patients) and those not receiving PEMF stimulation (control group, 160 patients). Postoperative care was otherwise identical. Follow-up was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Result(s): The PEMF and control groups were comparable with regard to age, gender, race, past medical history, smoking status, and litigation status. Both groups were also comparable in terms of baseline diagnosis (herniated disc, spondylosis, or both) and number of levels operated (one, two, three, or four). At 6 months postoperatively, the PEMF group had a significantly higher fusion rate than the control group (83.6% vs. 68.6%, p=.0065). At 12 months after surgery, the stimulated group had a fusion rate of 92.8% compared with 86.7% for the control group (p=.1129). There were no significant differences between the PEMF and control groups with regard to VAS pain scores, NDI, or SF-12 scores at 6 or 12 months. No significant differences were found in the incidence of adverse events in the groups. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized, controlled trial that analyzes the effects of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. PEMF stimulation significantly improved the fusion rate at 6 months postoperatively in patients undergoing ACDF with an allograft and an anterior cervical plate, the eligibility criteria being patients who were smokers or had undergone multilevel cervical fusion. At 12 months postoperatively, however, the fusion rate for PEMF patients was not significantly different from that of the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events in the two groups, indicating that the use of PEMF stimulation is safe in this clinical setting. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

2433,"[Virtual reality in neurosurgery]. DEFINITION: Virtual reality enables users to immerse themselves in a virtual three-dimensional world and to interact in this world. The simulation is different from the kind in computer games, in which the viewer is active but acts in a nonrealistic world, or on the TV screen, where we are passively driven in an active world. In virtual reality elements look realistic, they change their characteristics and have almost real-world unpredictability.USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY: Virtual reality is not only implemented in gambling dens and the entertainment industry but also in manufacturing processes (cars, furniture etc.), military applications and medicine. Especially the last two areas are strongly correlated, because telemedicine or telesurgery was originated for military reasons to operate on war victims from a secure distance or to perform surgery on astronauts in an orbiting space station. In medicine and especially neurosurgery virtual-reality methods are used for education, surgical planning and simulation on a virtual patient. [References: 33]",Excluded

454,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex affects mental rotation. Neuroimaging studies have shown that motor structures are activated not only during overt motor behavior but also during tasks that require no overt motor behavior, such as motor imagery and mental rotation. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the primary motor cortex is needed for mental rotation by using single- pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the representation of the hand in left primary motor cortex while participants performed mental rotation of pictures of hands and feet. Relative to a peripheral magnetic stimulation control condition, response times (RTs) were slower when TMS was delivered at 650 ms but not at 400 ms after stimulus onset. The magnetic stimulation effect at 650 ms was larger for hands than for feet. These findings demonstrate that (i) activation of the left primary motor cortex has a causal role in the mental rotation of pictures of hands; (ii) this role is stimulus-specific because disruption of neural activity in the hand area slowed RTs for pictures of hands more than feet; and (iii) left primary motor cortex is involved relatively late in the mental rotation process.",Excluded
3570,"A study on an evaluation of brain scanning in cerebrovascular diseases. [Japanese]. One hundred twenty cases of cerebrovascular diseases mainly of ischemic nature were studied. Positive brain scans were found in ischemic cerebral infarction in 68% of the cases; with a relatively low rate in the early phase from the onset of the illness showing a peak of positive scans in 2 to 4 wk with a gradual decline. Even those with a positive scan turned negative after 8 wk. A definite correlation between the clinical severity and positive scan was found. In cases with cortical involvement positive brain scan was observed in high frequency. Single brain scan yielded only a value of screening procedure but follow-up examinations in the course of illness proved to be rather important for the differential diagnosis of underlying pathology and further for fortelling the prognosis. In view of the prognosis of motor functions those with an intense uptake of radioisotope, a relatively large sized and persistent abnormality were likely left with severe neurological deficit while in cases who showed a mild and transient positive scan the recovery of motor functions were favorable. When rate of positive scan for the respective territory of cerebral vessels were evaluated, positive scans were most frequently observed in the vicinity of middle cerebral artery. The frequency of positive scans in the territory of posterior cerebral artery and vertebro-basilar artery were found lowest. Brain scanning was found most suitable for the diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, subdural hematoma and SLE vasculitis but it exhibited merely low rate of posivity in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and transient ischemic attack. This method compared to other auxillary diagnostic procedures presently available proved to be accurate with its technical simplicity.

1947,"Comparison of responses of neurons in the mouse inferior colliculus to current injections, tones of different durations, and sinusoidal amplitude-modulated tones. We made in vivo whole cell patch-clamp recordings from the inferior colliculus of young-adult, anesthetized C57/Bl6 mice to compare the responses to constant-current injections with the responses to tones of different duration or to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones. We observed that voltage-dependent ion channels contributed in several ways to the response to tones. A sustained response to long tones was observed only in cells showing little accommodation during current injection. Cells showing burst-onset firing during current injection showed a small response to SAM tones, whereas burst-sustained cells showed a good response to SAM tones. The hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation channel I(h) had a special role in shaping the responses: I(h) was associated with an increased excitability, with chopper and pauser responses, and with an afterhyperpolarization following tones. Synaptic properties were more important in determining the responses to tones of different durations. A short-latency inhibitory response appeared to contribute to the long-pass response in some cells and short-pass and band-pass neurons were characterized by their slow recovery from synaptic adaptation. Cells that recovered slowly from synaptic adaptation showed a relatively small response to SAM tones. Our results show an important role for both intrinsic membrane properties -- most notably the presence of I(h) and the extent of accommodation -- and synaptic adaptation in shaping the response to tones in the inferior colliculus.",Excluded
2414,"Stereotactic radiosurgery: The preferred management for patients with nonvestibular schwannomas?. Purpose: To review patient outcomes after radiosurgery of nonvestibular schwannomas. Methods and Materials: From April 1992 to February 2000, 23 patients had radiosurgery at our center for nonvestibular schwannomas. Affected cranial nerves included the trochlear (n = 1), trigeminal (n = 10), jugular foramen region (n = 10), and hypoglossal (n = 2). Nine patients had undergone one or more prior tumor resections. One patient had a malignant schwannoma; 2 patients had neurofibromatosis. The median prescription isodose volume was 8.9 cc (range, 0.2 to 17.6 cc). The median tumor margin dose was 18 Gy (range, 12 to 20 Gy); the median maximum dose was 36 Gy (range, 24 to 40 Gy). The median follow-up after radiosurgery was 43 months (range, 12 to 111 months). Result(s): Twenty-two of 23 tumors (96%) were either smaller (n = 12) or unchanged in size (n = 10) after radiosurgery. One patient with a malignant schwannoma had tumor progression outside the irradiated volume despite having both radiosurgery and fractionated radiation therapy (50.4 Gy); he died 4 years later. Morbidity related to radiosurgery occurred in 4 patients (17%). Three of 10 patients with trigeminal schwannomas suffered new or worsened trigeminal dysfunction after radiosurgery. One patient with a hypoglossal schwannoma had eustachian tube dysfunction after radiosurgery. No patient with a lower cranial nerve schwannoma developed any hearing loss, facial weakness, or swallowing difficulty after radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): Although the reported number of patients having radiosurgery for nonvestibular schwannomas is limited, the high tumor control rates demonstrated after vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery should apply to these rare tumors. Compared to historical controls treated with surgical resection, radiosurgery appears to have less treatment-associated morbidity for nonvestibular schwannomas, especially for schwannomas involving the lower cranial nerves. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Intraoperative neuronal microrecordings can help in localizing the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during stereotactic neurosurgery for deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease. To obtain quantitative information on neuronal spike descriptors, we systematically analysed neuronal spikes in the STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in 31 sides of the brain in awake patients undergoing stereotactic neurosurgery for DBS electrode implantation. In these two structures we evaluated spike amplitude, area, duration, rise time and mean total firing rate. The recording spike density was higher in the STN than in the SNr (94% vs. 28%). Microelectrode recordings showed a larger spike area and amplitude in the SNr than in the STN ([mean+/-SD] amplitude: 46.7+/-31.1 vs. 36.3+/-29.6 microV; area: 25.6+/-24.2 vs. 36.7+/-21.4 microVmsec), a higher total firing rate at rest in the SNr than in the STN (78.6+/-53.5 vs. 61.9+/-40.8 Hz), and a longer duration and rise time in the SNr than in the STN (duration: 2.0+/-1 vs. 1.3+/-0.6 ms; rise time: 0.95+/-0.6 vs. 0.67+/-0.3 ms).

BACKGROUND: Thermoluminescent dosimeter badges currently utilized to monitor occupational radiation exposures are limited in their ability to provide timely feedback, restricting workers' ability to identify unnecessary exposure. New real time radiation monitoring systems provide an opportunity for workers to immediately identify and alter problematic behaviors in the neuroangiography suite, decreasing unnecessary exposures, lowering risk, and maximizing safety efforts.METHODS: Real time radiation monitoring was performed for 120 diagnostic cerebral angiography procedures. Data were collected in two phases, for procedures performed by two physician participants (30 procedures per physician per phase). Workers were blinded to their real time dose in phase I, and unblinded in phase II. Individual exposures (Sv) and the incidence of red events (exposure rates >=2.0 mSv/h) were collected for each assigned participating role (physician A, physician B, nurse, scrubbed technologist, and circulating technologist). The dose area product was collected for each procedure to standardize against variations in procedure duration or intensity.RESULTS: In phase II, significant decreased radiation exposure was observed for all roles except physician A. Physician B decreased most from 24.3x10(-8) to 6.9x10(-8) Sv/Gy-cm(2) (p<0.0001). Rates of red events decreased similarly for all roles except physician A, and were significant for all roles except the nurse role.CONCLUSIONS: Real time radiation dose monitoring during diagnostic cerebral angiography may help to reduce occupational radiation exposures for healthcare workers.",Excluded

To gain knowledge about its role in sound perception, alterations in the COX-2 level of moderate noise-stimulated cochleae were determined. Staining intensities were quantified in different regions using an immunohistochemical staining procedure and computer-assisted system. After 70 dB and 90 dB noise exposure for 1 h at 8000 Hz, COX-2 downregulation was observed in the organ of Corti, which was most prominent in Deiters' cells near Hensen cells and outer hair cells. In pillar cells, COX-2 levels were only slightly reduced after 70 dB but strongly diminished after 90 dB exposure. In Hensen cells, COX-2 was downregulated after 70 dB stimulation, revealing a decreasing COX-2 content from the third to the first turn of the cochlea and a homogeneously reduced enzyme expression in all three turns after 90 dB. The COX-2 content in inner hair cells was nearly identical to unexposed cochleae after 70 dB exposure but significantly reduced after 90 dB stimulation. In spiral ganglion cells, stria vascularis, spiral ligament and limbus, COX-2 expression was unchanged after 70 dB and 90 dB. We suggest that alterations in COX-2 expression might contribute to diminished sensitivity at the cochlea after noise exposure to reduce subsequent noise distress, termed sound conditioning.",Excluded

Six underwent postmission optical coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 4 had lumbar punctures (LP). Approximately 300 astronauts were queried regarding visual changes during space missions.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refractive change, fundus photograph examination, retina OCT, orbital MRI, LP opening pressures, and examination of visual acuity data.RESULTS: After 6 months of space flight, 7 astronauts had ophthalmic findings, consisting of disc edema in 5, globe flattening in 5, choroidal folds in 5, cotton wool spots (CWS) in 3, nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT in 6, and decreased near vision in 6 astronauts.

Recent investigations suggest that there are differences between the characteristics of EEG and MEG epileptiform spikes. The authors performed an objective characterization of the morphology of epileptiform spikes recorded simultaneously in both EEG and MEG to determine whether they present the same morphologic characteristics. Based on a stepwise approach, the authors performed a computer analysis of EEG and MEG of a set of coincident epileptiform transients selected by a senior clinical neurophysiologist in recordings of three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A computer-based algorithm was applied to extract parameters that could be used to describe quantitatively the morphology of the transients, followed by a statistical comparison over the extracted metrics of the EEG and MEG waveforms. EEG and MEG coincident events were statistically different with respect to several morphologic characteristics, such as duration, sharpness, and shape. The differences found appear to be a consequence of MEG signals not being influenced by volume propagation through the tissues with different conductivities that surround the brain, compared with EEG, and of the different orientation of the underlying dipolar sources. The results indicate that visual inspection of MEG spikes and automatic spike-detector algorithms should use criteria adapted to the specific characteristics of the MEG, and not simply those used on conventional EEG.",Excluded

The weight vectors of the critic are updated by the model-free Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm, which is improved by eligibility trace and momentum factor. The weight vectors of the actor are updated based on the sign of TD error, and a Gauss exploration is carried out in the actor. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation and a comparison simulation are performed to show the effectiveness of the CACLA-based guidance strategy.",Excluded
408,[Respiratory system activity in laser irradiation of brain structures]. It has been shown that the low-level laser radiation with the wave-length in the red part of spectrum changes greatly the activity of the respiratory center under the direct influence on the rats' brain structure. The influence of light may have activating or inhibitory character; sometimes symmetry in the respiratory center activity is disturbed. The difference of the effects under the radiation of the sensomotor area of the cerebral cortex hemispheres and the area of the bulbar respiratory center has been found out. It is supposed that one of the reasons of the functional state of the respiratory center variations is the metabolism change in its structures.,Excluded
443,"Efficacy in vivo of a cancer therapy strategy combining HSV1716 mediated oncolysis with gene transfer and targeted radiotherapy. Oncolytic herpes viruses have show promise for the treatment of cancer however it is unlikely that the optimal application of these viruses will be as single therapeutic agents. An alternative strategy would be to utilise these viruses to deliver therapeutic transgenes and enhance their tumour cell killing capacity. The herpes simplex virus-1 deletion mutant HSV1716 is a conditionally- replicating oncolytic virus. The safety of HSV1716 has been demonstrated in phase 1 clinical trails with no toxicity attributable to the virus in any patients and provided proof of principle that the virus is capable of directly destroying human tumour cells while leaving normal cells intact (1). To enhance its therapeutic potential, we have engineered HSV1716 to convey the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT) and thus rendered transfected cells targetable with the radiopharmaceutical [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG. [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG is currently used in the treatment of NAT-expressing neuroblastoma, phaeochromocytoma and carcinoids. In this study we have utilised the recombinant virus HSV1716/NAT as a dual cell lysis / gene delivery vehicle for targeting of the NAT transgene to human tumour xenografts in vivo. We have shown that intra-tumoural or intra-venous injection of HSV1716/NAT induced the capacity for active uptake of intra-peritoneal administered [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in human glioma, melanoma and colorectal tumour xenograft models which do not express NAT. Tumour growth was significantly delayed after administration of HSV1716/NAT and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG compared to treatment with either agents alone. However, the efficacy of combination treatment was dependent on the scheduling of delivery of the two agents. These findings support a role for combination radio-/gene therapy for cancer utilising HSV1716 expressing the NAT transgene and targeted radionuclide therapy.",Excluded
959,"Opsin co-expression in Limulus photoreceptors: differential regulation by light and a circadian clock. A long-standing concept in vision science has held that a single photoreceptor expresses a single type of opsin, the protein component of visual pigment. However, the number of examples in the literature of photoreceptors from vertebrates and invertebrates that break this rule is increasing. Here, we describe a newly discovered Limulus opsin, Limulus opsin5, which is significantly different from previously characterized Limulus opsins, opsins1 and 2. We show that opsin5 is co-expressed with opsins1 and 2 in Limulus lateral and ventral eye photoreceptors and provide the first evidence that the expression of co-expressed opsins can be differentially regulated. We show that the relative levels of opsin5 and opsin1 and 2 in the rhabdom change with a diurnal rhythm and that their relative levels are also influenced by the animal's central circadian clock. An analysis of the sequence of opsin5 suggests it is sensitive to visible light (400-700 nm) but that its spectral properties may be different from that of opsins1 and 2. Changes in the relative levels of these opsins may underlie some of the dramatic day-night changes in Limulus photoreceptor function and may produce a diurnal change in their spectral sensitivity.",Excluded
3435,"Long-term trends in myocardial sympathetic innervation and function in synucleinopathies. Introduction: Parkinson disease (PD), pure autonomic failure (PAF), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are characterized by intra-cerebral deposition of the protein alpha-synuclein and are termed synucleinopathies. Lewy body synucleinopathies involve decreased cardiac sympathetic innervation and functional abnormalities in residual noradrenergic terminals. This observational, retrospective, cohort study describes long-term trends in indices of cardiac sympathetic innervation and function in synucleinopathies. Method(s): Patients with PD (N = 31), PAF (N = 9), or MSA (N = 9) underwent repeated <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine positron emission tomography (median follow-up 3.5 years). Interventricular septal <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine-derived radioactivity 8 min after tracer injection (8' Radioactivity) was used as an index of sympathetic innervation and the slope of mono-exponential decline of radioactivity between 8 and 25 min (k<inf>8'-25'</inf>) as an index of intraneuronal vesicular storage. Healthy volunteers (HVs) (N = 33) and individuals at high risk of PD (N = 15) were controls. Result(s): Upon initial evaluation the groups with PD and orthostatic hypotension (OH), PAF, or PD and no OH had low mean 8' Radioactivity compared to HVs (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0002, p = 0.006) and had elevated k<inf>8'-25'</inf> (p = 0.0007, p = 0.007, p = 0.06). There was no significant difference between MSA and HVs. In PD 8' Radioactivity decreased by a median of 4% per year and did not decrease in MSA. k<inf>8'-25'</inf> values did not change during follow-up in any group. Conclusion(s): Neuroimaging evidence of decreased vesicular uptake in cardiac sympathetic nerves is present upon initial evaluation of patients with Lewy body synucleinopathies and may provide a biomarker of catecholaminergic dysfunction early in the disease process.

Forty-eight patients were treated with 55 implants. The carotid artery was implanted in 15 patients, while seven patients had seeds inserted into the base of the skull region, and another three patients had implants near cranial nerves. Eighteen of the 48 patients were treated for cure. The actuarial survival at five years in this subgroup was 50%. The overall local control in the head and neck area was 58%. In this group no patients to date have had a local failure in the implanted volume. Seventeen patients with comparable stage of disease treated prior to 1974 with curative intent without 125I implants were analyzed retrospectively for comparison with the implanted patients. The actuarial survival of these patients was 18% and the overall head and neck control was 21%. These differences are statistically significant at a P value of 0.01 and 0.007, respectively. Seventeen patients received implants for local recurrence. The local control in the head and neck area was 50%; however, the 2.5 year actuarial survival was only 17%.

Operators of RF plastic sealers (RF operators) are an occupational category highly exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. The aim of the present study was to make an appropriate exposure assessment of RF welding and examine the health status of the operators. In total, 35 RF operators and 37 controls were included. The leakage fields (electric and magnetic field strength) were measured, as well as induced and contact current. Information about welding time and productivity was used to calculate time integrated exposure. A neurophysiological examination and 24 h ECG were also carried out. The participants also had to answer a questionnaire about subjective symptoms. The measurements showed that RF operators were exposed to rather intense electric and magnetic fields. The mean values of the calculated 6 min, spatially averaged E and H field strengths, in line with ICNIRP reference levels, are 107 V/m and 0.24 A/m, respectively. The maximum measured field strengths were 2 kV/m and 1.5 A/m, respectively. The induced current in ankles and wrists varied, depending on the work situation, with a mean value of 101 mA and a maximum measured value of 1 A. In total, 11 out of 46 measured RF plastic sealers exceeded the ICNIRP reference levels. RF operators, especially the ready made clothing workers had a slightly disturbed two-point discrimination ability compared to a control group. A nonsignificant difference between RF operators and controls was found in the prevalence of subjective symptoms, but the time integrated exposure parameters seem to be of importance to the prevalence of some subjective symptoms: fatigue, headaches, and warmth sensations in the hands. Further, RF operators had a significantly lower heart rate (24 h registration) and more episodes of bradycardia compared to controls.",Excluded

1182,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia. Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and sirolimus. Result(s): To date, a total of 41 patients have been transplanted; from 3/14/2008 to 10/3/2013. Patient characteristics: AML n=27, ALL Ph- n=10, ALL Ph+ n=2, Biphenotypic n=2; disease status at HCT, 1RL n=13, 2RL n=2, IF n=26; cytogenetic risk(SWOG criteria): intermediate n=19, unfavorable n=15 and unknown significance n=7 median KPS at HCT 90 (60-100); donor source sibling n=20, HLA matched unrelated n=5, mismatched (1 allele) unrelated n=16; WBC at HCT median 1.5 (0.1-14.9) % blasts (blood) at HCT median 2% (0-85%) % blasts (marrow) at HCT median 46% (10-90%) Two patients presented with extramedullary disease at time of HCT. With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively. The most common toxicity across the dose levels tested is grade 1 GI and grade 2 stomatitis (Bearman Scale). Causes of death were disease progression/persistent disease n=14, GvHD n=1 and infection n=1. Discussion(s): These results are encouraging and suggest that 1) doses of TMLI can be safely escalated to 1800 cGy in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide (MTD not reached, dose escalation will continue to 2000 cGy); 2) all patients treated with >=1700 cGy achieved a CR at the day 30 evaluation and that 3) a reduction in relapse/progression compared to published reports can be achieved without increasing NRM using targeted whole body radiation in this high risk population.",Excluded
1386,"The Influence of Early Measurements Onto the Estimated Kidney Dose in [<sup>177</sup>Lu][DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]Octreotate Peptide Receptor Radiotherapy of Neuroendocrine Tumors. Purpose: Multiple measurements have been required to estimate the radiation dose to the kidneys resulting from [<sup>177</sup>Lu]DOTATATE therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of early time-point measurement in the renal dose calculation. Procedures: Anterior/posterior whole-body planar scintigraphy images were acquired at approx. 1, 24, 48, and 72 h after administration of [<sup>177</sup>Lu]DOTATATE. Furthermore, we acquired planar 1-bed dynamic recordings in 12 frames (5 min each) during the first hour. We assessed kidney exposure with a three-phase model consisting of a linear increase to the maximum within the initial minutes p.i., followed a bi-exponential decline. This three-phase-model served as reference for evaluating accuracy of dose estimates in 105 kidneys calculated by conventional mono-exponential fitting of the final three and four whole-body images. Result(s): Mean effective half-life times for the reference model were 25.8 +/- 12.0 min and 63.9 +/- 17.6 h, predicting a mean renal dose of 5.7 +/- 2.1 Gy. The effective half-life time was 46.3 +/- 15.4 h for the last four and 63.3 +/- 17.0 h for the last three data points. The mean start of the first whole-body measurement was 1.2 +/- 0.1 h p.i. The ratio of fast to slow phases was 28.1 +/- 23.9 % at this time point, which caused a mean absolute percentage dose deviation of 12.4 % for four data points, compared to 3.1 % for three data points. At a mean time of 2.4 h p.i. (max 5.1 h), the ratio of fast to slow phase declined below 5 %. Conclusion(s): Kinetic analysis of renal uptake using dynamic planar scans from the first hour after injection revealed a fast and a slow washout phase. Although the fast phase did not contribute substantially to the estimated renal dose, it could influence planar measurements performed within the first hours. We found that the presence of two clearance phases can hamper accurate dose estimation based on a single-phase model, resulting in approximately 12.4 % dose underestimation, thus potentially resulting in overtreatment. In the absence of dynamic initial recordings, the first dosimetry measurements should therefore be obtained later than 3-5 h after [<sup>177</sup>Lu]DOTATATE injection.

The present investigation evaluates the dental care situation of patients with head and neck cancer before and after radiotherapy. The situations of these patients in 1993 and 2005 were compared to detect similarities, differences and developments. In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005. Therefore the applied radiotherapeutic regimen differed not only between the two groups of patients, but also within each group. The information for these investigations was provided anonymously. It was evaluated with descriptive statistics. The evaluation of the data shows distinct differences with respect to preventive and therapeutic dental care measures. In 2005, 35 out of 36 patients (97.2%) had a dental consultation before radiotherapy (1993, 65%). All 27 dentate patients (100%) obtained a splint for fluoride application (1993, none). 29% fewer edentulous patients were seen than in 1993. The number of teeth destroyed decreased from 19.2% (1993) to 7.8% in 2005. Mycoses due to Candida spp. and chronic failures in wound healing were rare (5.5%). In the course of the 12 years, prophylactic measures, such as the application of splints for fluoride treatment, were intensified. However, concepts for the dental care of patients undergoing radiotherapy, especially following the radiation, should be widened to avoid ruined teeth and long delayed wound healings.",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the impact of repeat head computed tomography (CT) during (1) interfacility transfer and (2) inpatient and/or outpatient follow-up on management, cost-effectiveness, and radiation dose in neurologically stable patients with mild traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). Material(s) and Method(s): This is a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with mild tSAH presenting between January 2017 and July 2019. A total of 101 and 140 patients met the eligibility criteria for the first and second subgroups, respectively. Common inclusion criteria were isolated mild tSAH, Glasgow Coma Scale between 13 and 15, and neurological stability. Additional inclusion criteria for the first subgroup were availability of brain imaging at the outside institution prior to transfer and the second subgroup was the availability of follow-up imaging. Result(s): In the first subgroup, 76.20% of patients had stable SAH, 18.80% had reduced SAH, while 5% had an interval increase in SAH. None required any surgical intervention. Additional per-patient mean radiation exposure was 1.77 +/- 0.26 mSv. In the second subgroup, all 140 patients had complete resolution of tSAH.

The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights.

Surgical treatment is a real challenge because this area is occupied by several critical neurovascular elements. Currently, surgery is the first choice of treatment, however several factors may be present that necessitate choosing the alternative treatments such as Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with CPA meningioma who were treated by GKS for a period of 8 years, were retrospectively reviewed. Factors affecting clinical and radiological improvement were analyzed.RESULTS: The median tumor volume was 6cm<sup>3</sup>. The mean values for maximal and marginal dose were 20.2 and 13.6Gy, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 31.5 months. Tumor control (lack of progression) was achieved in 96.8% of the patients and 55.9% of the patients showed tumor regression on follow-up MRI. The actuarial 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 96%. Clinical improvement was seen in 49.5% of the patients while 11.8% experienced worsening or new-onset symptoms. Adverse radiation effects were seen in 4.3% of the patients. A worse symptomatic outcome, male sex, a lower tumor coverage, and marginal doses <13.5Gy were associated with worse radiologic outcomes. Worse radiologic outcomes and higher tumor volumes, especially tumor volumes >=8.5cc, were associated with worse symptomatic outcomes. The male sex was associated with a lower PFS.CONCLUSION: Gamma Knife radiosurgery, either primarily or post- operatively, offers a decent long-term tumor control in CPA meningioma, and is associated with an acceptable complication profile, especially in tumors with lower volumes.",Excluded
712,"The Role of Advanced Imaging in Assessing Response to Definitive Chemoradiation Before Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We examined the responses to chemoradiation according to imaging modality in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Provided patients achieved at least a partial response, advanced imaging response neither affected survival nor added information to the decision to offer prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), suggesting that limited-stage SCLC patients with partial response using any imaging modality should not be denied PCI. Introduction: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) improves survival for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Evidence for PCI in limited-stage SCLC largely derives from studies requiring only chest x-ray (CXR) to determine remission status. We analyzed thoracic chemoradiation therapy (TCRT) outcomes according to imaging modality to determine which patients benefitted most from PCI. Patients and Methods: All limited-stage SCLC patients who received TCRT as well as PCI at our institution were reviewed. Imaging between TCRT end and PCI start was characterized as complete (CR), partial (PR), or other response. Result(s): Thirty-eight consecutive patients were assessed for TCRT response before PCI with CXR (n = 21), chest computed tomography (CT; n = 27), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 11). CR was identified on 71% of CXRs, 41% of CT scans, and 18% of PET/CT scans. Median survival was 28.3 months for the entire cohort and did not differ for patients who had CXR alone versus CT and/or PET/CT for restaging (P =.78) or those with PR using any modality versus CR using all modalities (22.6 months vs. 45.5 months; P =.22). CT CR patients had numerical but not statistically significant improved 2-year (P =.18) and 3-year (P =.13) survival compared with CT PR. Conclusion(s): CXR remains an appropriate modality to assess TCRT response before PCI in limited-stage SCLC. Advanced imaging did not inform the decision to offer PCI in this study. Because of similar excellent survival profiles independent of imaging modality and TCRT response, this analysis suggests limited-stage SCLC patients with PR using any modality should not be denied PCI, akin to standards for extensive-stage SCLC.

1493,"Computed tomography versus intravenous urography in diagnosis of acute flank pain from urolithiasis: a randomized study comparing imaging costs and radiation dose. The equivalent sensitivity of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and intravenous urography (IVU) in the diagnosis of suspected ureteric colic has been established. Approximately 50% of patients with suspected ureteric colic do not have a nephro-urological cause for pain. Because many such patients require further imaging studies, NCCT may obviate the need for these studies and, in so doing, be more cost effective and involve less overall radiation exposure. The present study compares the total imaging cost and radiation dose of NCCT versus IVU in the diagnosis of acute flank pain. Two hundred and twenty-four patients (157 men; mean age 45 years; age range 19-79 years) with suspected renal colic were randomized either to NCCT or IVU. The number of additional diagnostic imaging studies, cost (IVU A$136; CTU A$173), radiation exposure and imaging times were compared. Of 119 (53%) patients with renal obstruction, 105 had no nephro-urological causes of pain. For 21 (20%) of these patients an alternative diagnosis was made at the initial imaging, 10 of which were significant. Of 118 IVU patients, 28 (24%) required 32 additional imaging tests to reach a diagnosis, whereas seven of 106 (6%) NCCT patients required seven additional imaging studies. The average total diagnostic imaging cost for the NCCT group was A$181.94 and A$175.46 for the IVU group (P < 0.43). Mean radiation dose to diagnosis was 5.00 mSv (NCCT) versus 3.50 mSv (IVU) (P < 0.001). Mean imaging time was 30 min (NCCT) versus 75 min (IVU) (P < 0.001). Diagnostic imaging costs were remarkably similar. Although NCCT involves a higher radiation dose than IVU, its advantages of faster diagnosis, the avoidance of additional diagnostic imaging tests and its ability to diagnose other causes makes it the study of choice for acute flank pain at Christchurch Hospital.",Excluded

2039,"Extrapulmonary soft-tissue fibrosis resulting from hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy for pulmonary nodular lesions. PURPOSE: To clarify the incidence, symptoms, and timing of extrapulmonary fibrosis developing after hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 379 consecutive patients who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung tumors at four institutions between February 2001 and March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 1-72). We investigated the subjective and objective characteristics of the extrapulmonary masses, redelineated the origin tissue of each on the treatment planning computed tomography scan, and generated dose-volume histograms.RESULTS: In 9 patients (2.4%), extrapulmonary masses were found 3-36 months (median, 14) after irradiation. Coexisting swelling occurred in 3 patients, chest pain in 2, thumb numbness in 1, and arm edema in 1 patient. Extrapulmonary masses occurred in 5 (5.4%) of 92 and 4 (1.4%) of 287 patients irradiated with a 62.5-Gy and 48.0-Gy isocenter dose, respectively. The mean and maximal dose to the origin tissue was 25.8-53.9 Gy (median, 43.7) and 47.5-62.5 Gy (median, 50.2), respectively. In 5 of 9 patients, the standardized uptake values on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography was 1.8-2.8 (median, 2.2). Percutaneous needle biopsy was performed in 3 patients, and all the specimens showed benign fibrotic changes without malignant cells.CONCLUSION: All patients should be carefully followed after stereotactic body radiotherapy. The findings of any new lesion should prompt an assessment for radiation-induced extrapulmonary fibrosis before an immediate diagnosis of recurrence is made. Careful beam-shape modification and dose prescription near the thoracic outlet are required to prevent forearm neuropathy and lymphedema.",Excluded
1832,"The ATM gene and protein: possible roles in genome surveillance, checkpoint controls and cellular defence against oxidative stress. The autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is highly pleiotropic. It is characterized by gradual loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, leading to progressive neuromotor deterioration, immunodeficiency, developmental defects in specific tissues, profound predisposition to malignancy and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation. AT cells show chromosomal instability, premature senesence, radiosensitivity and defects in cell cycle checkpoints activated by ionizing radiation. Several radiation induced pathways that regulate the cell cycle seem to be defective in AT cells, at least one of which is mediated by TP53. Extensive characterization of the cellular defects of AT cells, together with the recent isolation of the ATM gene, has provided some insight into the possible physiological roles of the ATM protein. Several lines of evidence, including the nature of the agents that elicit the hypersensitivity of AT cells, point to the possibility of a defect in the response to damage induced by oxidative stress, which affects various cellular macromolecules. The ATM protein might have a role in activating defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. This hypothesis broadens the previous concept of the AT defect and explains several aspects of the AT phenotype that cannot be accounted for by defective processing of DNA damage.

600,"Is there a correlation between peptide receptor radionuclide therapy-associated hematological toxicity and spleen dose?. AIM: The spleen receives a high mean absorbed radiation dose during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRNT). The aim of this study is to correlate the radiation dose to spleen with the effect on blood cell count after PRRNT.METHODS: Fifty-three neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients were treated with 3.8-8.5 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC. Dosimetry was performed according to MIRD scheme. Eleven NET patients who had undergone splenectomy before PRRNT and who received 4.7-7.6 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC were selected as controls. RBC, WBC (total and differential), and platelet counts before and after each cycle of PRRNT were documented.RESULTS: The median dose to the spleen in the study group was 6.34 Gy (2.32-20.06 Gy). There was no significant difference in the posttherapy changes in the blood cell counts (RBC, WBC, or platelets) between the study group and the control group. Mild hematological toxicity was found in 7 of the 53 (13.2%) patients in the study group and in 1 out of the 11 patients (9.1%) in the control group. However, there was no correlation between the incidence or grade of hematological toxicity and the dose to the spleen.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates for the first time that hematological toxicity after PRRNT is not related to the radiation dose to the spleen.",Excluded
3288,"Tactile situation awareness system: proprioceptive prostheses for sensory deficiencies. UNLABELLED: Pilots and astronauts do not experience spatial disorientation in normal day-to-day terrestrial activities. On the ground, the perception of position and motion is determined by central nervous system integration of concordant and redundant information from multiple sensory channels (somatosensory, vestibular and visual) which collectively yield veridical perceptions. In the acceleration environments experienced by pilots and astronauts, the somatosensory and vestibular senses frequently present false but concordant information concerning the direction of gravity or down. When presented with conflicting sensory stimuli, it is normal for pilots and astronauts to experience episodes of disorientation. Visual instruments and displays developed over the past 70 yr have not solved the problem. A simple solution to maintain spatial orientation is to provide true information using the same sensory channels we use so successfully on Earth.METHODS: The Tactile Situation Awareness System (TSAS) developed by NASA and the U.S. Navy uses a matrix of mechanical tactile stimulators (tactors) applied on the torso and limbs to convey orientation cues (e.g., gravity vector) in an intuitive fashion to the skin. A series of in-flight experiments to validate and test a variety of tactile displays and concepts has been carried out in both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.RESULTS: Pilots were able to fly complex maneuvers with no instruments or outside visual references (blindfolded) with less than 20 min of training. Recovery from unusual attitudes solely by tactile cues was trivial. Lab tests have shown the TSAS improves performance under conditions of high workload.CONCLUSIONS: When orientation information is presented via intuitive tactile displays spatial orientation is easily maintained in altered sensory conditions including unusual acceleration environments.",Excluded
2547,"[Assessment of the surgeon radiation exposure during a minimally invasive TLIF: Comparison between fluoroscopy and O-arm system]. INTRODUCTION: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with a minimally invasive approach (MIS TLIF) has become a very popular technique in the treatment of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine, as it allows a decrease in muscle iatrogenic. However, iterative radiological controls inherent to this technique are responsible for a significant increase in exposure to ionizing radiation for the surgeon. New techniques for radiological guidance (O-arm navigation-assisted) would overcome this drawback, but this remains unproven.OBJECTIVES: To analyze the exposure of the surgeon to intraoperative X-ray during a MIS TLIF under fluoroscopy and under O-arm navigation-assisted.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the University Hospital of Lille from February to May 2013. Twelve patients underwent a MIS TLIF for the treatment of low-grade spondylolisthesis; six under standard fluoroscopy (group 1) and six under O-arm system (group 2). Passive dosimeters (rings and glasses) and active dosimeters for thorax were used to measure the radiation exposure of the surgeon.RESULTS: For group 1, the average time of fluoroscopy was 3.718 minutes (3.13-4.56) while no radioscopy was perform on group 2. For the first group, the average exposure dose was 12 muSv (5-20 muSv) on the thorax, 1168 muSv (510-2790 muSv) on the main hand and 179 muSv (103-486 muSv) on the lens. The exposure dose was measured zero on the second group.CONCLUSION: The maximum recommended doses can be reached, mainly for the lens.

228,"Differential processing of laser stimuli by Adelta and C fibres in major depression. Clinical studies have revealed that up to 92% of major depressed patients report pain complaints such as back or abdominal pain. Furthermore, patients suffering from depression exhibit increased superficial pain thresholds and decreased ischemic (deep) pain thresholds during experimental pain testing in comparison to healthy controls. Here, we aimed to investigate a putative role of Adelta- and C-fibre activation in altered pain perception in the disease. Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) of 27 unmedicated depressed patients and 27 matched controls were recorded. Adelta and C fibres were activated separately. Amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 peaks of Adelta- (Adelta-LEP) and C-fibre- (C-LEP) related LEPs were evaluated. Depressed patients showed significantly decreased Adelta-LEP amplitudes (N2 peak: P=0.019; P2 peak: P=0.024) and delayed C-LEP latencies (P2 peak: P=0.0495; N2 peak: P=0.0556). In contrast, C-LEP amplitudes and Adelta-LEP latencies were unaffected. Our results might be suggestive of the differential impact of physiological changes on pain processing in depression. Thus, Adelta-LEP might reflect the physiological correlate of the augmented superficial pain thresholds during depression. On the contrary, the C-fibre component mediates the facets of pain processing, outlasting the stimulation period, and has been shown to be exaggerated in chronic pain states. Therefore, the functional over-representation of the C-fibre component found in our study might be a possible link between depression and associated pain complaints.",Excluded

On the basis of literature reports up to 1988 the incidence, clinical pattern and treatment of cerebral complications following radiotherapy administered to the organs and tissues of the head are discussed. Acute radiation-induced reaction and early delayed reaction in the form of e.g. the so called somnolence syndrome or rhombencephalopathy are rare and their prognosis is usually good. In 1 to 14% of the patients delayed reaction may develop corresponding to the late radiation necrosis, usually with progressive unfavourable course. A problem of practical importance is the impossibility of differentiating radiation-induced cerebral necrosis from recurrence, expansion of the primary tumour or metastatic tumour, even using CT and MNR. Only the poorly available positron emission tomography makes possible differential diagnosis. Sometimes, surgical or pharmacological treatment of cerebral necrosis is effective.

Peptide aggregation state and/or conformation might play a significant role in determining the toxicity of the peptide. The size and flexibility of fibrils formed from the synthetic peptide beta (1-39), corresponding to the first 39 residues of A beta, were determined. Samples were prepared either directly from lyophilized peptide or diluted from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All samples had a final peptide concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, a final pH of 7.4, and a final NaCl concentration of 0.14 M. The molecular weight and linear density of the fibrils increased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA, based on static light scattering measurements. Analysis of the angular dependence of the intensity of scattered light indicated that the fibrils were semi-flexible chains and that the fibril flexibility decreased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA. There was a concomitant change in phase behavior from precipitation to gelation with the decrease in fibril flexibility.",Excluded
2382,"Focused ultrasound-mediated suppression of chemically-induced acute epileptic EEG activity. BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is attributed to uncontrollable abnormal hyper-excitability of neurons. We investigated the feasibility of using low-intensity, pulsed radiation of focused ultrasound (FUS) to non-invasively suppress epileptic activity in an animal model (rat), which was induced by the intraperitonial injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ).RESULTS: After the onset of induced seizures, FUS was transcranially administered to the brain twice for three minutes each while undergoing electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. An air-backed, spherical segment ultrasound transducer (diameter: 6 cm; radius-of-curvature: 7 cm) operating at a fundamental frequency of 690 KHz was used to deliver a train of 0.5 msec-long pulses of sonication at a repetitive rate of 100 Hz to the thalamic areas of the brain. The acoustic intensity (130 mW/cm2) used in the experiment was sufficiently within the range of safety guidelines for the clinical ultrasound imaging. The occurrence of epileptic EEG bursts from epilepsy-induced rats significantly decreased after sonication when it was compared to the pre-sonication epileptic state. The PTZ-induced control group that did not receive any sonication showed a sustained number of epileptic EEG signal bursts. The animals that underwent sonication also showed less severe epileptic behavior, as assessed by the Racine score. Histological analysis confirmed that the sonication did not cause any damage to the brain tissue.CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that low-intensity, pulsed FUS sonication suppressed the number of epileptic signal bursts using acute epilepsy model in animal. Due to its non-invasiveness and spatial selectivity, FUS may offer new perspectives for a possible non-invasive treatment of epilepsy.",Excluded

Alternating Notch activity saved more progenitors that are prone to produce neurons creating larger number of mixed clones with neurons and progenitors in vitro, compared to groups with no light or continuous light stimulus. Furthermore, more upper layer neurons and astrocytes arose upon intermittent Notch activity, indicating that dynamic Notch activity maintains neural progeny and fine-tune neuron-glia diversity.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-operative SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for large brain metastases is challenged by risks of radiation necrosis that limit SRS dose. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a potential alternative, however standard dose recommendations are lacking.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty consecutive brain metastases treated with post-operative SRS were retrospectively compared to IORT plans generated for 10-30 Gy in 1 fraction to 0-5 mm by estimating the applicator size and distance from critical organs using pre-operative and post-operative MRI. Additionally, 7 consecutive patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to surface were compared to retrospectively generated SRS plans using the post-operative MRI to 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy in 1 fraction marginal dose.RESULTS: For the 20 resection cavities treated with SRS and retrospectively compared to IORT, IORT from 10 to 30Gy resulted in lower or not significantly different doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. Comparatively for the 7 patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to retrospective SRS plans to standard 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy marginal dose, IORT resulted in significantly lower doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months, 86% of patients treated with surgery and IORT achieved local control and 0% developed radiographic or symptomatic radiation necrosis.CONCLUSIONS: Critical organ dosimetry for IORT remains generally lower than that achieved with single fraction SRS following resection of large brain metastases. We recommend 30 Gy to surface as the preferred prescription, consistent with the dose recommendation for IORT in glioblastoma used in the ongoing INTRAGO-II phase-III trial.

Pericardial effusions associated with sarcoidosis are uncommon (19% of cases.) Case Report: A 54-year-old lady was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of a breast biopsy in 2014 that revealed non-caseating granulomas. Since then, the patient has had chronic persistent dyspnea. Also, she has had involvement of cardiac muscle, her neurological system (unable to raise the left arm), spleen, lungs (stage 2, bilateral hilar adenopathy with infiltrates), and bony involvement of hands (arthritis and clubbing.) Often, patients with stage 2 sarcoidosis tend to go into remission spontaneously (40-70%.) In our patient's case, none of her multi-organ system manifestations abated. Up until this point, her lifelong condition has never been treated despite her symptoms because she refused corticosteroids. Superimposed on this patient were additional inflammatory diagnoses: Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, treated lyme disease, second degree heart block, spinal meningitis, tick-borne alpha 1,3 galactose allergy. When we met the patient our focus was patient-centered education. We convinced our patient to accept steroid treatment because PET-MRI imaging may now detect scar vs. inflamed, viable tissue in her ventricle with enhanced sensitivity. Discussion(s): Newer-generation PET-MRI scans have ability to differentiate scar vs. inflammatory muscle with enhanced sensitivity. This improves clinical decision-making. Only 40-50% patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are diagnosed during their lifetime. To avert missed diagnoses, the advent of improved PET-MRI allows us to detect and treat cardiac sarcoidosis. It is incumbent to treat, because, if left untreated, the risk of sudden death from cardiac sarcoidosis is as high as 85%. Recent developments in PET technology reduce radiation dose. In our patient's situation, her decision to finally initiate therapy at age 54 was based on a patient-centered, empathic, compassionate explanation of the multi-system organ nature of her disease and the advantageous properties of PET-MRI to detect a treatable cause of dyspnea.",Excluded
860,"Posture, locomotion, spatial orientation, and motion sickness as a function of space flight. This article summarizes a variety of newly published findings obtained by the Neuroscience Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and attempts to place this work within a historical framework of previous results on posture, locomotion, motion sickness, and perceptual responses that have been observed in conjunction with space flight. In this context, we have taken the view that correct transduction and integration of signals from all sensory systems is essential to maintaining stable vision, postural and locomotor control, and eye-hand coordination as components of spatial orientation. The plasticity of the human central nervous system allows individuals to adapt to altered stimulus conditions encountered in a microgravity environment. However, until some level of adaptation is achieved, astronauts and cosmonauts often experience space motion sickness, disturbances in motion control and eye-hand coordination, unstable vision, and illusory motion of the self, the visual scene, or both. Many of the same types of disturbances encountered in space flight reappear immediately after crew members return to earth. The magnitude of these neurosensory, sensory-motor and perceptual disturbances, and the time needed to recover from them, tend to vary as a function of mission duration and the space travelers prior experience with the stimulus rearrangement of space flight. To adequately chart the development of neurosensory changes associated with space flight, we recommend development of enhanced eye movement systems and body position measurement. We also advocate the use of a human small radius centrifuge as both a research tool and as a means of providing on-orbit countermeasures that will lessen the impact of living for long periods of time with out exposure to altering gravito-inertial forces.",Excluded

Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about genderspecific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men.

1923,"Direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cancer. Introduction Cancer patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality due to thrombosis and bleeding, in addition they may also have pre-existing conditions, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE), for which chronic anticoagulation may be indicated. Historically, warfarin was the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant for stroke prevention in AF patients. Since 2010, the US FDA has approved 4 alternative direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. There is limited literature to support the use of DOACs in cancer patients, but they are being prescribed by medical professionals nonetheless. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the DOACs in cancer patients, to quantify their bleeding risks, and to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from these new medications in comparison to warfarin. Large randomized clinical trials of DOACs compared to warfarin in cancer patients have not been performed. Our aim was to determine the effectiveness and associated risk of DOACs vs. warfarin in a large, real-world population of cancer patients with AF. Methods We identified 532,743 AF patients initiating oral anticoagulant use in 2010-2014 continuously enrolled in MarketScan databases. We selected 41,036 cancer patients with inpatient or outpatient ICD9 code 140.x-172.x and 174.x-209.x (excluded 173.x, non-melanoma skin cancer), and then identified a subset of cancer patients being actively treated at the time of anticoagulant initiation. Active cancer patients were defined by the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or cancer surgery within 6 months prior to the start of anticoagulation. Patients were categorized according to the first anticoagulant prescribed after AF diagnosis. DOAC users were matched with warfarin users by age (+/-3 years), sex, enrollment date (90 days), and anticoagulant initiation date (90 days). Study endpoints, including ischemic stroke, severe bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding), other bleeding (genitourinary bleeding, hemopericardium, hemarthrosis, epistaxis, hemoptysis and unspecified hemorrhage) and VTE were identified using inpatient diagnostic codes, and VTE was additionally identified from 2 outpatient diagnostic codes within the same year. Cox proportional hazards models were used to access the association between type of anticoagulant and outcomes adjusting for high-dimensional propensity score, age, sex, CHA DS -VASc score, and the prevalent outcome. Results The demographic profile of the patients included in the analysis are depicted in Table 1, and Table 2 summarizes the outcomes data. In this analysis there were 6,075 cancer patients with AF who were on DOACs (rivaroxaban 2808, dabigatran 2189, and apixaban 1078) compared to 10,021 on warfarin, with a mean age of 74 years, and a mean follow-up time of 1 year. Approximately 40% of the patients were woman, and breast cancer was the most common cancer in each cohort. We found that for rivaroxaban and dabigatran users, the adjusted hazard ratios for severe bleeding was non significantly different to warfarin users, however, apixaban users had a lower risk of severe bleeding compared to warfarin users, with a hazard ratio 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.79, p=0.01). The risk of other bleeding was lower in dabigatran users compared to warfarin users with a hazard ratio 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.84, p=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke did not differ significantly amongst different anticoagulant users. Each of the DOACs was superior to warfarin in lowering the risk of incident VTE, with p values < 0.0001. Conclusion Based on this analysis the DOACs seem to be well tolerated in cancer patients in regard to the management of atrial fibrillation, with lower or similar rates of bleeding and stroke compared to warfarin users. Importantly, the DOAC users had a significantly lower risk of incident VTE. Given that VTE ev nts contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, prescription of DOACs in place of warfarin can be considered in cancer patients with AF, while we are awaiting prospective data from randomized trials.

We aimed to investigate any differences in methylation before or after treatment. Method(s): Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer were identified. Tumour tissue from pretreatment biopsies and post treatment resections for the same patients was subjected to DNA extraction. This was also modelled in vitro by administering ionizing radiation (7-15 Gy) to a colorectal cancer cell line and extracting DNA 48 hour later. Methylation specific PCR was used to characterize the methylation status of CpG islands in the promoter regions of 8 genes associated with rectal cancer. PCR band size and intensity was measured to give a semiquantiative analysis of methylation intensity in the cell line experiment. Result(s): 17 patients underwent analysis. Methylation was seen less frequently in post treatment specimens for all 8 markers, however, this difference was significant for one marker (ADAMTS1, 10/17 methylated pre vs 0/17 post, P = 0.001) and approached significance for another (hMLH1, 6/17 vs 1/17, P = 0.08).

Result(s): From February 2009 to April 2013, 83 PTS registered; 5 were ineligible; 4 not treated. 74 were available for toxicity evaluation (TOX); 72 had available data; 62 PTS (86%) had surgery. 1 grade 5 TOX and 2 grade 4 TOX occurred. 7 PTS withdrew for TOX, 2 for other reasons. 18 of 62 PTS had pCR (25%, 95% CI 16-37%). 19 PTS (26%) had microscopic cancer; 35 PTS (49%) had minor/no response (10 no surgery). Conclusion(s): ICT and NACR with CET improved pCR over historical and recent rates of ~20%. Toxicity was generally acceptable. This approach can serve as a base for adding additional agents in KRAS-WT LARC.",Excluded
1670,"Quantitative assessment of cerebral hemodynamics using perfusion-weighted MRI in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease: comparison with positron emission tomography. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to acetazolamide is a key parameter in determining the severity of hemodynamic impairment in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease. Perfusion-weighted MRI (PW MRI) can measure the cerebral blood volume (CBV) as an indicator of hemodynamic impairment. CBV measured by PW MRI was compared with CVR measured by positron emission tomography (PET).METHODS: Twelve normal subjects and 17 patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease underwent PW MRI and PET. The images were coregistered with 3-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition images. Quantitative PW MRI-CBV maps were generated using the indicator dilution method with arterial input function. One large cortical region of interest for each unilateral middle cerebral artery territory was determined on each image. PET-CVR was calculated by measuring cerebral blood flow before and after acetazolamide challenge.RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was observed between PW MRI-CBV and PET-CVR (r=-0.713; P<0.0001). PW MRI-CBV higher than the mean +2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.2 mL/100 g) was defined as elevated and PET-CVR lower than the mean -2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.1%) was defined as reduced. Assuming the PET-CVR as the true determinant of hemodynamic impairment, PW MRI-CBV provided 80.0% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with 80.0% positive predictive value for detecting patients with reduced CVR.CONCLUSIONS: The PW MRI-CBV method can simply and accurately identify patients with hemodynamic impairment without exposure to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

118,"The future of radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer care. Cancer is a very challenging condition and one of the fastest growing health challenges in the developed world. As cancer is not one but hundredsof conditions it cannot be expected to be managed by one approach. The cellular, metabolic and genetic factors as well as location, stage and extent all contribute to the characterisation of the disease as well as the therapeutic approach. Radiation should be viewed as a very powerful therapeutic agent in the arsenal to combat cancer. New technological advances have given us tools to apply radiation in a variety of ways dependent on clinical situation. Increasing precision of the radiation therapy systems is creating a trend towards higher doses delivered over shorter time periods. The use of stereotactic techniques is becoming more common. This increased precision, facilitated by image guidance integrated with systems, is decreasing exposure to the healthy tissue and hence with reduced complications. From being viewed as palliative care, radiation therapy has transformed to being applied with a curative intention in many clinical situations. A case example is Leksell Gamma Knife that delivers high doses with pin-point accuracy to tumours in the brain. In Gamma Knife surgery the therapeutic dose is delivered in one session and image guidance relies on advanced MRI technologies. In brain metastase patients the treatment has the potential to significantly transform the outcome and management options for large patient groups, having breast and lung cancer as primary cancer disease. Technologies applied in modern cancer care are continuously evolving and we have seen how radiation protocols are being combined with other methods in integrated management approaches. By combining radiation with other modalities such as surgery as well as biological agents and drugs further improvement can be achieved. Future more comprehensive care processes require collaboration between specialties and information and communication become important features to be able to utilize the most cost effective treatment. In this paper the global utilization of RT is further discussed with an overview of some national and global examples how the care practice of RT has been evolving. Trends and recent advancement will be discussed as well as cost-effectiveness aspects of radiation therapy. The need for strengthening partnership between industry and healthcare providers will be discussed as both are critical partners in the fight against cancer. Technological advancements and methods would not become available to health systems around the world without an Industry that develops solutions, secure that products meets regulatory demands and are properly tested prior to introduction.",Excluded
1490,"Characterization of a new rat model of experimental combined neurotrauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is present in two-thirds of patients with multiple injuries and in one-third combined with injuries of the extremities. Studies on interactive effects between central and peripheral injuries are scarce due to the absence of clinically relevant models. To meet the demand for ""more-hit"" models, an experimental model of combined neurotrauma (CNT) incorporating a standardized TBI via lateral fluid percussion (LFP) together with a peripheral bone fracture, i.e., tibia fracture, is introduced. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four experimental groups: controls (n = 10), animals with TBI (n = 30), animals with tibia fracture (n = 30), and animals with CNT (n = 30). Morphological aspects of brain and bone injury were analyzed via standard histopathological procedures and x-ray. Trauma-induced neuromotor dysfunction was assessed using a standardized neuroscore. For interactive effects between injuries, we studied the extent and temporal pattern of circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels via immunoassay and callus formation at fracture sites by means of microradiography. LFP produced an ipsilateral lesion with cortical contusion, hemorrhage, mass shift, and neuronal cell loss (adjacent cortex and hippocampus CA-2/-3), along with contralateral neuromotor dysfunction. X-rays confirmed complete fractures in the middle of the bone shaft. The type of injury (P < 0.001) and time (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with increased IL-6 levels. CNT produced the highest IL-6 plasma levels with a maximum peak at 6 h after trauma (P < 0.001). Similarly, callus formation at fracture sites in CNT was significantly increased versus fracture only (P < 0,01). The CNT model mimics a variety of clinically relevant features known from human multiple injury, including TBI, and offers novel approaches for investigation of interactive mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.",Excluded

3371,"Inhibition of rhodopsin kinase by recoverin. Further evidence for a negative feedback system in phototransduction. Recoverin is a 23-kDa Ca(2+)-binding protein found predominantly in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Recent electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest that recoverin may regulate the photoresponse by inhibiting rhodopsin phosphorylation. We find in both cell homogenates and reconstituted systems that the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by recoverin occurs over a significantly higher free Ca2+ range than previously reported. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 1.5-3 microM free Ca2+ and is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. Measurements of transducin activation demonstrate that this inhibition prolongs the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin. Ca(2+)-recoverin directly inhibits rhodopsin kinase activity, and Ca(2+)-dependent binding of recoverin to rod outer segment membranes is not required for its action. Extrapolation of the in vitro data to in vivo conditions based on simple mass action calculations places the Ca(2+)-recoverin regulation within the physiological free Ca2+ range in intact rod outer segment. The data are consistent with a model in which the fall in free Ca2+ that accompanies rod excitation exerts negative feedback by relieving inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation.",Excluded
586,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ameliorates recognition memory impairment induced by hindlimb unloading in mice associated with BDNF/TrkB signaling. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which could improve learning and memory, is widely used in psychiatry and neurology as a therapeutic approach. There are few studies reporting effective countermeasures to cognition decline in astronauts during space flight. Accordingly, we examined whether rTMS was able to significantly alleviate the learning and memory deficits induced by hindlimb unloading (HU), a general accepted rodent model to simulate microgravity, in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, rTMS, HU, and HU+rTMS groups. The hindlimb unloading procedure continued for consecutive 14 days. Meanwhile, high frequency rTMS (15Hz) was applied for 14 days from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of HU procedure. The novel object recognition test showed that the recognition memory was evidently impaired in the HU group compared to that in the Sham group, however, rTMS significantly attenuated the impairment of the memory. Furthermore, rTMS significantly improved the HU-induced LTP impairment and increased spine density in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. Additionally, rTMS enhanced the expressions of postsynaptic function-associated proteins N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NR2B and NR2A) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), upregulated BDNF/TrkB signaling and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) in the HU+rTMS group. In conclusion, the data suggest that high frequency rTMS may be an effective countermeasure against the learning and memory deficiency, induced by simulated microgravity.",Excluded

Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer and commonly metastasizes to the bone, adrenal glands, liver, and brain. Intestinal metastasis is infrequent and clinical manifestations of this are even rarer. We present a case of metastatic adenocarcinoma to the ileum in a patient presenting with passing dark red blood from his rectum. A 60 year-old male, with past medical history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the brain, status-post left lower lung lobectomy and craniotomy with right frontal partial lobectomy, a remote history of cerebrovascular accident on current anti-platelet therapy, and residual dysphagia on gastric tube feeds, presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness for 1 week. He had completed chemotherapy and radiation 3 months prior. Vomiting and loose stools occurred after feeds. Initial evaluation revealed a cachectic man with decreased air entry and rhonchi on pulmonary exam, and a soft, non-distended abdomen. Vitals were significant for hypotension, 90/50mmHg. On day 2 of hospitalization, the patient had hematochezia and a drop in hemoglobin from 8.1g/dL to 6.2g/dL. He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells. Gastroenterology was consulted for continued rectal bleeding and performed a colonoscopy. Blood clots were present throughout the colon and a 4 centimeter submucosal mass with ulceration of the overlying mucosa was visualized in the ileum, narrowing the lumen (Image A, B).

1764,"CT-aided low-count whole-body PET imaging using cross-modality attention pyramid network. Objectives: Reducing either the administered dose or scan time of PET imaging is desirable as it decreases the radiation exposure to the patient or can improve patient comfort as well as minimize motion artifact. However, the trade-off of these benefits are low overall counts and increased noise, adversely impacting image contrast and quantification. To enable low dose or shorten the PET scan while maintaining the high signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient image quality, we propose a novel method to integrate CT into a deep learning framework to aid the estimation of diagnostic quality PET images from low-count ultra-short PET scans. Method(s): We propose a cross-modality attention pyramid network (CMAPN) to generate diagnostic quality PET images from low-count PET images with the help of CT from PET/CT scans. Twenty subjects with whole-body PET/CT were used to estimate synthetic diagnostic PET images from a low-count training set using 1/8th of the normal scanning time (19 vs. 162 seconds/bed). CMAPN learns to translate a low-count PET image into a synthetic full-count PET image resembling the one from a high-quality diagnostic standard clinical protocol. At the training stage, independent 3D patch-based deep features were extracted from low-count PET and CT images using two separate PET synthesis sub-networks. The two sub-networks share the same pyramid network architecture. A low-count PET-only synthesis loss, and a CT-only synthesis loss were calculated between the outputs of the two sub-networks. The two losses would allow independent and relevant features to be extracted from low-count PET and CT images for the prediction of full-count PET images. The cross-modal deep features from the two subnetworks were subsequently combined to estimate a final full-count PET image. Feature maps of corresponding pyramid levels were first concatenated and then highlighted via attention gates. The network was trained by minimizing a combination of losses, including a low-count PET-only synthesis loss, a CT-only synthesis loss and a final synthesis loss. At the testing stage, paired low-count PET and CT image patches were first extracted from the original images. These image patch pairs were then inputted into the trained CMAPN to obtain the synthetic full-count PET patches. Finally, the synthetic full-count PET image patches were fused to predict the final whole-body full-count PET images. These synthetic PET images were then compared to the original diagnostic PET images for evaluation. The proposed method was tested using a leaveone-out cross-validation method. Mean error (ME), normalized mean square error (NMSE), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used to quantify the differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. Result(s): The average ME, NMSE, NCC and PSNR in the whole body were 0.20+/-1.01% and 0.67+/-0.28%, 0.994+/-0.004% and 46.2+/-2.8dB for all patients. There were no significant differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. In a volume of interest, such as the brain, lung, heart, kidneys, and liver, the overall ME was less than 2.5% and the NMSE was less than 1.5% for all patients. Lesion-based ME and NMSE were less than 5% for all patients. Conclusion(s): We have developed a novel CT-aided estimation method for synthetic full-count PET images using CMAPN. The proposed method could generate diagnostic quality PET datasets from ultra-short (1/8th count, 19 seconds/bed) PET scans. The organ boundary definition of the generated PET has improved due to the use of CT images in CMAPN. The proposed method has great potential to improve the quality of low-count PET scans for future implementation of low dose or fast scan PET imaging in the clinic.",Excluded

1948,"Extracranial radiosurgery (stereotactic body radiation therapy) for oligometastases. Extracranial radiosurgery, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), is an increasingly used method of treatment of limited cancer metastases located in a variety of organs/sites including the spine, lungs, liver, and other areas in the abdomen and pelvis. The techniques used to perform SBRT were initially modeled after intracranial radiosurgery, although considerable evolution in technique and conduct has occurred for extracranial applications. Unlike intracranial radiosurgery, SBRT requires characterization and accounting for inherent organ movement including breathing motion. Potent dose hypofractionation schedules have been used with SBRT such that the treatment is generally both ablative and convenient. Because the treatment is severely damaging to tissues within and about the target, the volume of adjacent normal tissue must be strictly minimized to avoid toxic late effects. Outcomes in various sites show very high rates of local control with toxicity mostly related to tubular tissues like the airways and bowels. With proper conduct though, SBRT can be an extremely effective treatment option for oligometastases. [References: 67]",Excluded

Introduction: Intracranial hemorrhage is simultaneously the most frequent and most debilitating manifestation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM), but its impact on success and complications of radiosurgery has not been rigorously assessed. In this case-control study, we define the effect of prior hemorrhage on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. Method(s): From a prospective, institutional database of 1400 AVM patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, unruptured and ruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to outcome, based on patient demographics, prior embolization, AVM size (mean volume of unruptured AVMs 3.7 cm3 versus ruptured AVMs 3.5 cm3, P=0.195), Spetzler-Martin grade and radiosurgical treatment parameters (mean prescription dose for unruptured AVMs 20.9 Gy versus ruptured AVMs 21.0 Gy, P=0.837). There were 270 patients in each cohort. Matched statistical analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics, obliteration rates, post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage risks, and incidences of radiation-induced changes (RIC) between the two cohorts. Result(s): The actuarial obliteration rates of the two cohorts were similar (unruptured AVMs: 38%, 58%, 76% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 40%, 60%, 73% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.592). However, for embolized AVMs, complete obliteration was more likely to be achieved in unruptured lesions (unruptured AVMs: 25%, 32%, 54% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 18%, 27%, 42% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.038). Prior AVM rupture resulted in a higher annual risk of post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage (ruptured AVMs 2.3% versus unruptured AVMs 1.1%, P=0.025) but a lower rate of cumulative and symptomatic RIC (cumulative RIC: ruptured AVMs 30.4% versus unruptured AVMs 48.9%, P<0.0001; symptomatic RIC: ruptured AVMs 7.0% versus unruptured AVMs 12.2%, P=0.041, respectively). The rates of permanent RIC were similar between the unruptured (2.2%) and ruptured (1.9%) AVM cohorts (P=0.761). Conclusion(s): Prior AVM rupture significantly alters the risk of latency period hemorrhage and RIC following radiosurgery. These effects should be taken into consideration with the multidisciplinary management of AVM patients.",Excluded
326,"Dynamics of Ca(2+) and Na(+) in the dendrites of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells evoked by parallel fibre stimulation. Ca2+ and Na+ play important roles in neurons, such as in synaptic plasticity. Their concentrations in neurons change dynamically in response to synaptic inputs, but their kinetics have not been compared directly. Here, we show the mechanisms and dynamics of Ca2+ and Na+ transients by simultaneous monitoring in Purkinje cell dendrites in mouse cerebellar slices. High frequency parallel fibre stimulation (50 Hz, 3-50-times) depolarized Purkinje cells, and Ca2+ transients were observed at the anatomically expected sites. The magnitude of the Ca2+ transients increased linearly with increasing numbers of parallel fibre inputs. With 50 stimuli, Ca2+ transients lasted for seconds, and the peak [Ca2+] reached approximately 100 microm, which was much higher than that reported previously, although it was still confined to a part of the dendrite. In contrast, Na+ transients were sustained for tens of seconds and diffused away from the stimulated site. Pharmacological interventions revealed that Na+ influx through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and Ca2+ influx through P-type Ca channels were essential players, that AMPA receptors did not operate as a Ca2+ influx pathway and that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphate receptors or ryanodine receptors did not contribute greatly to the large Ca2+ transients.",Excluded

613,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases. BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients.METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation.RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.",Excluded
3388,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases after prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited disease small-cell lung cancer. Background: Brain metastases are very common in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and to improve overall survival in patients with limited-disease SCLC (LD-SCLC). However, brain metastases are often observed after PCI, and the optimal treatment for these brain metastases is still unclear. The present study investigated the recurrence of brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC and the therapeutic efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery for these metastases. Method(s): Between December 2000 and December 2012, 228 patients with LD-SCLC were treated and 98 of these patients with a complete response (CR) or a near CR to chemoradiotherapy underwent PCI at the National Cancer Center Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and imaging data for these 98 patients. Result(s): Twenty-four (24%) of the 98 patients developed brain metastases after PCI. The characteristics of the 24 patients were as follows: median age, 62 years (49-72 years), male/female, 21/3; performance status 0/1/2, 2/16/6. Twelve (50%) of the 24 patients had cranial recurrences only. Twelve patients had single brain metastases, and 12 patients had multiple lesions. Nine patients had neurological symptoms due to brain metastases. The median period after PCI until the appearance of the metastases was 9.9 months (1.1-34.9 months). Fifteen (63%) of the 24 patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife radiosurgery [GKRS]), and one patient received whole brain radiotherapy. Six patients were treated with chemotherapy plus best supportive care (BSC), and two patients underwent BSC alone. The 15 patients who received GKRS had brain metastases with/without extracranial lesions (7 with, 8 without); three were symptomatic, and 12 were asymptomatic. The median number of brain metastases at the time of the first GKRS was one (range, 1-4). The local control rate of the lesions treated with GKRS was 86.7% (complete response in 3 patients, partial response in 7 patients, and stable disease in 3 patients). Five patients underwent further GKRS because of newly developing brain metastases (median: 4 times, range: 2-7 times). The median intracranial control time of the 15 patients was 6.8 months. The median survival time of the 15 patients was 29.3 months after the initial diagnosis, 13.7 months after the development of brain metastases, and 12.7 months after the treatment of GKRS. The median survival time of the patients without extracranial lesions was 20.2 months after the development of brain metastases and tended to be longer than that of the patients with extracranial lesions (12.6 months). Severe adverse events arising from GKRS were not observed in this series.

1275,"Correlating radiographical and pathological response to immunotherapy in primary brain tumors. Objective: The radiographic response of primary brain tumors to immunotherapy is poorly understood. This study investigates the imaging and pathological characteristics of primary brain tumors after exposure to immunotherapy. Background(s): Immunotherapy amplifies the innate immune response to solid cancers. For example, inhibitors of immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 block signals to inhibitory T cells, thus increasing the T-cell mediated response to non-self antigens. In prior studies, a subset of systemic cancers treated with immunotherapy demonstrate radiographic worsening prior to pathological/clinical response to treatment. While this phenomenon of ""pseudo-progression"" has been described in primary brain tumors after temozolomide and radiation, the radiographic response to immunotherapy is poorly characterized. Design/Methods: Inclusion criteria are 1) primary brain cancer diagnosis, 2) second resection, and 3) use of immunotherapy prior to re-resection. ""Immunotherapy"" includes PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, or dendritic cell vaccines. Patients can utilize other chemotherapies and/or tumor treating fields, concurrently. Radiographical response on MRI is defined by RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro- Oncology) criteria. Pathological diagnosis is defined by WHO criteria. Result(s): At our center, 90 patients with primary brain cancers received immunotherapy during the course of cancer treatment. 10 of these patients (9 glioblastoma and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma) had re-resection after initiation of immunotherapy, with radiographical progression at 0.6-9.6 months, and repeat resection at 0.7-12.6 months. Of the 10 patients, resection pathology was characterized as predominantly treatment effect in 4 patients, and predominantly recurrent tumor in 6 patients. Further analysis will be done to characterize the molecular and genetic characteristics of resection tissue. Conclusion(s): Given promise in other cancer fields, immunotherapy is becoming increasingly popular in the treatment of primary brain cancer. In this limited case series, 4 out of 10 patients treated with immunotherapy had radiographic progression without significant pathologic progression. This suggests that immunotherapy may be continued past radiographic progression.",Excluded

Lower-dose configurations were reconstructed (25-effective mAs iterative reconstruction, 50-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection). Three neuroradiologists circled findings, indicating diagnosis, confidence (0-100), and image quality. The difference between the jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit at routine and lower-dose configurations was estimated. A lower 95% CI estimate of the difference greater than -0.10 indicated noninferiority.RESULTS: Forty-two of 83 patients had 70 intracranial findings (29 infarcts, 25 masses, 10 extra- and 6 intra-axial hemorrhages) at routine head CT (CT dose index = 38.3 mGy). The routine-dose jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.93). Noninferiority was shown for 100-effective mAs iterative reconstruction (figure of merit difference, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.004) and 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.02; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02) but not for 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02) or lower-dose levels. Image quality was better at higher-dose levels and with iterative reconstruction (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Observer performance for dose levels using 100-200 eff mAs was noninferior to that observed at 250 effective mAs with iterative reconstruction, with iterative reconstruction preserving noninferiority at a mean CT dose index of 15.2 mGy.",Excluded

837,"Percutaneous fixation of thoracolumbar fractures. Does index level fixation help in fracture reduction and stability?. Introduction: Thoracolumbar burst fractures are caused by compression injury with subsequent loss of vertebral height and development of local kyphotic deformity. The application of pedicle screws in the fractured vertebrae i.e. index level fixation, had been proven to help in reduction and correction of the local kyphotic deformity and anterior vertebral height loss with their maintenance in short segment fixation. Recently, percutaneous pedicle screws are introduced and used in the thoracolumbar fracture fixation with the proposed advantage of the less soft tissue dissection, muscle disruption and atrophy and assumed less wound related complications. Controversy remains about the ability of the percutaneous instrumentation to reduce and maintain the correction of local kyphosis and lost vertebral height caused by the fracture compared to the open instrumentation. Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective study, thirty-eight neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (T11-L2) type A3 and A4 according to AOSpine classification were treated between 2012 and 2015 with posterior pedicle screw fixation. The patients were divided into two groups, group 1 included 18 patients treated with percutaneous pedicle screws (PPS) while group 2 included 20 patients treated by standard open posterior approach with pedicle screws fixation (OPS). The operative data (blood loss, radiation exposure, operative time, and cost of implants) were compared between the two groups. The patients' radiographs were assessed for local kyphotic angle (LKA) and anterior vertebral body height (AVH) compression and compared for correction and maintenance. The patients' visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain and treatment related complications were reported. Result(s): The blood loss was the only operative parameter that was significantly less in the PPS group and although the operative time decreased in the PPS group by the increase in learning curve, the other operative data show significant difference in favor of the OPS group. Post-operative correction of the local vertebral compression assessed radiologically with LKA and AVH significantly improved in both groups compared to the pre-operative degree and was maintained till the end of follow up. No major wound related complication was found in both groups. VAS of back pain was significantly reduced in PPS group in the early postoperative follow up than the OPS, but both groups at the end showed a significant improvement between early post-operative and late follow up. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is a good minimally invasive modality in the management of thoracolumbar fractures and the application of screw in the fractured vertebrae improves the correction and maintenance of local kyphosis in short segment fixation. Cost effectiveness of this technique must be evaluated thoroughly with the final and late outcome of this management. More randomized controlled and multicenter studies are needed to support these findings.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To investigate (i) the effect of monochromatic light on inhibiting induction of light-induced melatonin and (ii) the roles of melanopsin and MT1 receptor in light-induced myopia in the guinea pig.METHODS: Forty-eight guinea pigs were randomly distributed into three treatment groups: white-light (control), green-light (530 nm), and blue-light (480 nm) groups. Levels of pineal gland melatonin were measured twice daily--10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--10 days after initial light treatment. Thirty additional guinea pigs were also assigned to these groups and treated similarly. For these latter animals, refractive status, ocular length, and vitreous depth were measured before and after light treatment. Eight weeks after light treatment, retinal and sceral levels of melanopsin, melatonin receptor type (MT) 1, and mRNA protein were determined by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The level of pineal gland melatonin in the green-light group was significantly higher than that in the blue-light group. Biometric measurements showed that guinea pigs in the green-light group had a somewhat myopic refractive status. Expressions of retinal melanopsin mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the blue-light group and lower in the green-light group when compared to controls. Conversely, expressions of MT1 receptor mRNA and protein in retina and sclera were significantly higher in the green-light group and lower in the blue-light group when compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Green light appears to suppress induction of melatonin production. In addition, 530 nm of green light is involved in the development of myopia. In the guinea pig, MT1 receptor and melanopsin appear to play roles in the development of myopia induced by 530 nm of light.",Excluded

1110,"[Otolaryngological cancer pain at the after-effects stage]. The standards of pharyngolaryngeal tumor treatment have changed over the years in an attempt to prevent laryngeal mutilation (partial surgery, endoscopic surgery, sequential radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). Pain induced by these treatments is frequent and varies from one treatment to another. Chemoradiotherapy induces less pain but often more severe pain, since 20% of these situations are not controlled by strong opioids. Pain from mucositis, although nonspecific to otolaryngic cancer, is more frequent and more severe, and prevention and treatment remain poorly defined. Pain from postradiotherapeutic necrosis (mandibula, laryngeal cartilage, etc.) is less frequent, delayed, and extremely severe. Cervical and shoulder pain is present in more than one-third of patients and stems from a number of mechanisms (myofascial and articulatory). It is secondary to radiotherapy or surgery (XIth cranial nerve lesions during curage or flap reconstruction). Finally, pain coexists with disturbances of basic functions (speech, swallowing, etc.) and the disability generated by treatments. Management of pain, suffering, and the psychosocial impact is essential. [References: 34]",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To determine the detection rate of intracranial vessel occlusions using CT perfusion-based wavelet-transformed angiography (waveletCTA) in acute ischemic stroke patients, in whom single-phase CTA (spCTA) failed to detect an occlusion.METHODS: Subjects were selected from a cohort of 791 consecutive patients who underwent multiparametric CT including whole-brain CT perfusion. Inclusion criteria were (1) significant cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficit, (2) no evidence of vessel occlusion on spCTA and (3) follow-up-confirmed acute ischemic infarction. waveletCTA was independently analysed by two readers regarding presence and location of vessel occlusions. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of waveletCTA-detected occlusions.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, an occlusion was identified using waveletCTA in 31 (52.5 %) patients with negative spCTA. Out of 47 patients with middle cerebral artery infarction, 27 occlusions (57.4 %) were detected by waveletCTA, mainly located in the M2 (15) and M3 segments (8). The presence of waveletCTA-detected occlusions was associated with larger CBF deficit volumes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.335, p = 0.010) and shorter times from symptom onset (OR = 0.306, p = 0.041).CONCLUSIONS: waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in about half of acute ischemic stroke patients and may potentially identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy.KEY POINTS: * waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in stroke patients. * waveletCTA-detected occlusions are associated with larger cerebral blood flow deficits. * waveletCTA has the potential to identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy. * waveletCTA implies neither additional radiation exposure nor extra contrast agent.",Excluded

2676,"Neoadjuvant versus definitive chemoradiation in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. BACKGROUND: Multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (nCRT + S) is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or node-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (E-SCC). Those who are unsuitable or who decline surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiation (dCRT). This study compares the oncologic outcome of nCRT + S and dCRT in E-SCC patients.METHODS: Between 2011 and 2017, 95 patients with E-SCC were scheduled for dCRT or nCRT+ S with IMRT at our department. Patients undergoing dCRT received at least 50 Gy and those undergoing nCRT + S received at least 41.4 Gy. All patients received simultaneous chemotherapy with either carboplatin and paclitaxel or cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. We retrospectively compared baseline characteristics and oncologic outcome including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and site of failure between both treatment groups.RESULTS: Patients undergoing dCRT were less likely to have clinically suspected lymph node metastases (85% vs. 100%, p = 0.019) than patients undergoing nCRT + S and had more proximally located tumors (median distance from dental arch to cranial tumor border 20 cm vs. 26 cm, p < 0.001). After a median follow up of 25.6 months for surviving patients, no significant differences for OS and PFS were noticed comparing nCRT + S and dCRT. However, the rate of local tumor recurrence was significantly higher in patients treated with dCRT than in those treated with nCRT + S (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.002). Within a multivariate Cox regression model, age, tumor location, and tumor grading were the only independent parameters affecting OS and PFS. In addition to that, proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently associated with an increased risk for local treatment failure.CONCLUSION: In E-SCC patients treated with either dCRT or nCRT + S, a higher rate of local tumor recurrence was seen in patients treated with dCRT than in patients treated with nCRT + S. There was at least a trend towards an improved OS and PFS in patients undergoing nCRT + S. However, this should be interpreted with caution, because proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently affecting the risk of local tumor recurrence.",Excluded

2061,"Lower doses to hippocampi and other brain structures for skull-base meningiomas with intensity modulated proton therapy compared to photon therapy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy of skull-base meningiomas is challenging due to the close proximity of multiple sensitive organs at risk (OARs). This study systematically compared intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) based on automated treatment planning. Differences in OARs sparing, with specific focus on the hippocampi, and low-dose delivery were quantified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients, target diameter >3cm, were included. Automated plan generation was used to calculate a VMAT plan with three non-coplanar arcs, an IMRT plan with nine non-coplanar beams with optimized gantry and couch angles, and an IMPT plan with three patient-specific selected non-coplanar beams. A prescription dose of 50.4 GyRBE in 28 fractions was used. The same set of constraints and prioritized objectives was used. All plans were rescaled to the same target coverage. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in OAR dose parameters between planning techniques.RESULTS: Compared to VMAT and IMRT, IMPT significantly improved dose conformity to the target volume. Consequently, large dose reductions in OARs were observed. With respect to VMAT, the mean dose and D<sub>40%</sub> in the bilateral hippocampus were on average reduced by 48% and 74%, respectively (p<=0.005). With IMPT, the mean dose in the normal brain and volumes receiving 20-30Gy were up to 47% lower (p<=0.01). When comparing IMPT and IMRT, even larger dose differences in those OARs were observed.CONCLUSION: For skull-base meningiomas IMPT allows for a considerable dose reduction in the hippocampi, normal brain and other OARs compared to both non-coplanar VMAT and IMRT, which may lead to a clinically relevant reduction of late neurocognitive side effects.",Excluded
1782,"Radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases based on a fast, three-dimensional MR imaging technique. A fast, three-dimensional (3D) sequence for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and its application in radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases is reported. The measuring sequence (MPRAGE) requires magnetization-prepared 180degree inversion pulses followed by rapid low angle excitation pulses and gradient-echoes for image generation. The resulting T<inf>1</inf>-weighted MPRAGE images were compared with two-dimensional (2D) T<inf>1</inf>- weighted spin-echo (SE) images after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. Gd- DTPA in 10 patients with known brain metastases. Original or multiplanar reformatted images obtained from a 128 partition data set of the 3D MPRAGE sequence offered comparable diagnostic quality to that of 2D SE imaging. Gd- DTPA enhancement and lesion targeting was similar in most of the patients in SE as well as MPRAGE imaging. During imaging and therapy the patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the MR and the linear accelerator installations. The dose calculation of the radiosurgery planning was based on 3D MR imaging data assuming a homogenous attenuation value inside the head which was sufficient for an accurate dose calculation since tissue inhomogeneities do not significantly influence the shape of the relative dose distribution especially for radiosurgery of the brain. Under this circumstance the dose calculation can be based only on the 3D geometric conformation of the patient's head. A simple algorithm for treatment planning can be used if the MR data are free of geometric distortion. Target point definition, external head contour, and critical structures could be precisely defined in 3D MPRAGE images offering important advantages (i.e., improved spatial resolution, reformatted image reconstruction, rapid 3D imaging and short examination time under mask fixation resulting in better patient comfort, better slice profile, reduced vascular pulsation artefacts, superior and variable choice of soft tissue contrast due to centric phase-encoding order, lower specific absorption rate) over conventional 2D SE imaging. In addition, target volume, calculated dose distribution, and critical structures can be displayed as 3D shaded structures for better assessment for matching of target volume and dose distribution. These findings, along with other advantages of 3D imaging, indicate that the MPRAGE sequence may provide an alternative to T<inf>1</inf>-weighted 2D SE imaging in the radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The thermal damage of the surrounding tissue can be an unwanted result of continuous-wave laser irradiations. In order to propose an effective alternative to conventional surgical techniques, photothermal damage must be taken under control by a detailed dose study. Real-time temperature monitoring can be also an effective way to get rid of these negative effects. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of a new laser-thermoprobe, which consists of a continuous-wave 1,940-nm Tm:fiber laser and a thermocouple measurement system for brain surgery in an ex vivo study.STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A laser-thermoprobe was designed for using the near-by tissue temperature as a real-time reference for the applicator. Fresh lamb brain tissues were used for experiments. 320 laser shots were performed on both cortical and subcortical tissue.RESULTS: The relationship between laser parameters, temperature changes, and ablation (removal of tissue) efficiency was determined. The correlation between rate of temperature change and ablation efficiency was calculated.CONCLUSION: Laser-thermoprobe leads us to understand the basic laser-tissue interaction mechanism in a very cheap and easy way, without making a change in the experimental design. It was also shown that the ablation and coagulation (thermally irreversible damage) diameters could be predicted, and carbonization can be avoided by temperature monitoring.",Excluded

Introduction: PTLD associated lymphoma is the second most common malignancy in patients receiving SOT or HSCT with an incidence rate of 1%-3%. PCNS-PTLD occurs in 7%-15% of all PTLD cases. We present a case of isolated PCNS lymphoma two years after renal transplant. Case Description: A 57 year old woman with PMH of ESRD s/p kidney transplant (D/EBV -,R/ EBV +) with chronic CrCl of 30-40% presented with paresthesia and numbness over the right side of her body with mild ataxia 2 years post transplant. Physical exam revealed only numbness over the right side of body. MRI with contrast revealed a left thalamic lesion with moderate vasogenic edema, and MR spectroscopy confirmed high grade neoplasm involving left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy showed polymorphic CD-20 and EBV positive PTLD. EBV PCR were elevated. Further evaluation ruled out systemic PTLD. Myfortic was stopped and oral steroids started with mild improvement in symptoms. Choice of systemic chemotherapy was limited due to reduced CrCl and risks of graft failure. She received modified regimen with renally adjusted high dose Methotrexate, Vincristine and Rituximab for 6 cycles with partial remission and then Temozolomide for 7 cycles with complete remission. Discussion(s): The incidence of PTLD ranges from 1 to 25% with 90% of cases being EBV-associated, CD20 positive, B cell neoplasms. PCNS-PTLD has a higher incidence in renal SOT, occurs late and is usually monomorphic unlike our patient. Median time of occurrence is 4-5 years after transplant. Risk factors include age, intensity of immunosuppression, time to transplant and EBV status of donor and recipient. Common presenting features include neurological deficits, seizure, and raised intracranial pressure. MRI is the preferred imaging and shows multifocal, ill defined, ring enhancing lesions usually in supratentorial and lobar regions. Positive CSF EBV PCR is highly suggestive but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment modalities include reduction of immunosuppression, rituximab, high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and cranial radiotherapy. Use of high dose methotrexate has shown improved outcomes with median survival of 26-47 months. Lack of response to first line therapy is considered the dominant prognostic factor.

Induction of Egr-1 in the pars tuberalis began ~11h after dawn. This response was followed ~6h later by dramatic induction in the tuberal hypothalamus, including in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. At approximately the same time, Egr-1 was induced in dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus and in dopaminergic neurons of the premammillary nucleus. We noted no induction in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons until 2h after dawn the following morning. Overall, our results indicate that Egr-1 responses in GnRH neurons occur rather late during photostimulation, compared with responses in other cell populations, and that such induction may reflect new synthesis related to GnRH depletion rather than stimulation by light cues.",Excluded
1817,"Electrically evoked GABA release in rat hippocampus CA1 region and its changes during kindling epileptogenesis. Previous findings on changes in K+-induced GABA release from hippocampal slices during kindling epileptogenesis were reinvestigated using physiological electrical stimulation. For that purpose, a procedure was developed enabling neurochemical monitoring of GABA release locally in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices upon tetanic stimulation of Schaffer-collateral fibers. In the presence of a GABA reuptake blocker, subsequent application of short (3 s) pulses of 50-Hz stimuli induced a local transient increase in GABA release. In slices from fully kindled animals, 24 h after the last generalized seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release was increased in comparison to control slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, 4-5 weeks after the last seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release had returned to control levels. Application of the broad low-affinity GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen increased the tetanically stimulated GABA release in control slices, but had no effect in fully kindled slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, however, saclofen enhanced GABA release similarly as in control slices. We conclude that the transient increase in tetanus-induced GABA release during kindling epileptogenesis is seizure-related, and probably caused by temporarily impaired presynaptic GABAB receptors.

Chemical neurolysis based on the perivascular infusion of alcohol via endovascular technique represents a safe and effective method which includes performance characteristics essential to the procedure. METHODS The Peregrine SystemTM Infusion Catheter contains 3 micro-needles which are deployed through the media of an artery into the adventitial region. The device is directed into the renal arteries using standard endovascular techniques. A small volume of Dehydrated Alcohol (0.3 mL-0.6 mL) when infused through the catheter, distributes circumferentially and axially along the vessel. The infusion is performed at a single site of each renal artery. Alcohol is a well-characterized neurolytic agent and functions in a consistent, dose-dependent fashion by a combination of cellular dehydration, extraction of lipids, and precipitation of proteins of target tissue. Targeted delivery of the alcohol to the perivascular space ensures that the perirenal nerves are destroyed while preserving adjacent tissue. RESULTS No procedural vascular adverse events have been reported with the use of the Peregrine Catheter. The delivery mechanisms of the device are highly flexible and atraumatic. Alcohol, as a hygroscopic agent, distributes evenly at the site of infusion. Ablation depths of up to 13 mm, as measured from the IEL, are observed. Alcohol is distributed circumferentially around the vessel (with some variation due to adjacent anatomic structures) to form a 'cuff' surrounding the artery at the infusion site. An ablation area of up to 57 mm2 have been reported based on morphometric measurements. Renal norepinephrine has been reduced by 64%-86% compared to controls. Since a single deployment and infusion is required at each renal artery, procedure time, contrast, radiation exposure are all reduced. CONCLUSION Preclinical data has shown that endovascular alcohol mediated renal denervation using the Peregrine Catheter incorporates the performance characteristics required to produce more effective neurolysis of the sympathetic perirenal nerves. On-going and completed clinical trials continue to demonstrate promising results of both safety and effectiveness.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To measure scattered laser energy reaching the posterior pole during transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.METHODS: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was performed on 4 cadaver eyes with Nd:YAG noncontact, Nd:YAG contact, and diode contact lasers. Energy was measured with a photodiode through a 7-mm trephined hole in the posterior pole. Average percentage power, average power, and average energy transmission were calculated. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines were used to calculate allowable energy exposures for each laser.RESULTS: All 3 lasers transmitted 3% to 5% of the power to the posterior pole. The average energy transmission was 240 to 260 mJ for all lasers. The contact lasers had an average power transmission of 120 mW. The noncontact Nd:YAG laser, with shorter pulse duration, had an average power transmission of 13,000 mW, significantly greater than that of the other lasers. The ACGIH guidelines for allowable energy exposures were 93 mJ for the noncontact Nd:YAG laser, 1300 mJ for the contact Nd:YAG laser, and 440 mJ for the contact diode laser.CONCLUSIONS: Three percent to 5% of laser power delivered during cyclophotocoagulation reaches the posterior pole.

1172,"Effect of jump exercise training on long-term head-down bed rest-induced cerebral blood flow responses in arteries and veins. New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What is the effect of an exercise countermeasure on microgravity-induced change in cerebral blood flow? What is the main finding and its importance? Jump exercise training as a countermeasure did not modify the heterogeneous cerebral blood flow response to head-down bed rest, suggesting that this method is effective in preventing cardiovascular system deconditioning but is not good for cerebral haemodynamics. Abstract: This study aimed to examine the effect of an exercise countermeasure on cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to long-term -6degree head-down bed rest (HDBR) in all cerebral arteries and veins. Twenty male volunteers were exposed to HDBR for 60 days with (training group, n = 10) or without (control group, n = 10) jump exercise training as a countermeasure to spaceflight. The blood flow in the neck conduit arteries (internal carotid and vertebral artery; ICA and VA) and veins (internal jugular and vertebral veins; IJV and VV) was measured, using ultrasonography before (baseline) HDBR, on the 30th and 57th day of HDBR. Long-term HDBR causes a heterogeneous CBF response between the anterior and the posterior brain or between arteries and veins. Long-term HDBR decreased anterior cerebral arterial and venous blood flow, while posterior cerebral arterial and venous blood flows were well maintained. However, exercise jump training did not change each arterial and venous CBF responses to HDBR (control vs. training; ICA, P = 0.643; VA, P = 0.542; external carotid artery, P = 0.644; IJV, P = 0.980; VV, P = 0.999).

1549,"Experimental approaches to radiation-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain. The developing mammalian brain is highly susceptible to ionizing radiation. Significant increases in microcephalus, heterotopic cortical gray matter, and mental retardation have been noted in prenatally exposed survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the highest risk in those exposed during 8-15 weeks after fertilization. This stage corresponds to day 15 of pregnancy for rats and day 13 for mice in terms of brain development. The initial damage produced by radiation at this stage is cell death in the ventricular zone of the brain mantle, the radiosensitive germinal cell population. Disturbances in the production of neuronal germinal cells, and their migration to the cerebral cortex, give rise to malformations of the brain, such as microcephalus, an absent corpus callosum, disorganized cortical architecture, and heterotopic gray matter. Histological abnormalities are produced by about 500 mGy or more, and reduced brain weight is produced by 250 mGy or more. Mitotic delay, on the other hand, in the ventricular cells is caused by 100 mGy or more. A similar threshold level is suggested in human cases in the induction of mental retardation. The lowest doses of X- and gamma-radiation that induce detectable biological effects in rats and mice are around 30 mGy in increasing acute cell death.",Excluded
328,Low Dose Brain Irradiation Reduces Amyloid-beta and Tau in 3xTg-AD Mice. We have previously reported that low doses of external beam ionizing irradiation reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and improved cognition in APP/PS1 mice. In this study we investigated the effects of radiation in an age-matched series of 3xTg-AD mice. Mice were hemibrain-irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy and sacrificed 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Abeta and tau were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantified using image analysis with Definiens Tissue Studio. We observed a significant reduction in Abeta plaque burden and tau staining; these two parameters were significantly correlated. This preliminary data is further support that low doses of radiation may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.,Excluded
278,"Cognitive function and patient-reported memory problems after radiotherapy for cancers at the skull base: A cross-sectional survivorship study using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module. Background: Using patient-reported and objective assessment tools, we sought to quantify cognitive symptoms and objective cognitive dysfunction in patients irradiated for skull base cancer. Method(s): Participants were assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck module (MDASI-HN), with subsequent analysis. Result(s): Of the 122 participants analyzed, the majority (63%) had no frank detectable cognitive impairment by TICS, with frank impairment in 6%. Overall, mean patient-reported problems with memory (MDASI<inf>memory</inf>) was 3.3 (SD +/-2.66). On recursive partition analysis, the MDASI<inf>memory</inf> cutoff point of >=5 was associated with detectable cognitive impairment by TICS (logworth 1.69; P =.02), yet no MDASI<inf>memory</inf> threshold was associated with unambiguous absence of impairment by TICS. Conclusion(s): Approximately one third of patients had ambiguous results by TICS assessment, for whom more rigorous testing may be warranted. Moderate to severe levels of patient-reported memory complaints on the MDASI-HN module may have utility as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in this population.

PURPOSE: To compare the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections with respect to successful intra-articular needle placement, fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and dose area product (DAP).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. 498 fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections were performed or supervised by one of nine staff radiologists from 11/1/2010-12/31/2013. The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP).RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001). Mean radiation dose and DAP were less for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (2.1 +/- 3.7 mGy versus 2.5 +/- 3.5 mGy, P = 0.04; 11.5 +/- 15.3 muGy-m(2) versus 13.5 +/- 17.3 muGy-m(2), P = 0.006).CONCLUSION: Both injection approaches resulted in nearly 100% rates of intra-articular needle placement, but the lateral mortise approach used approximately 40% less fluoroscopy time and delivered 15% lower radiation dose and DAP to the patient.",Excluded
1240,"Upfront radiosurgery plus targeted agents followed by active brain control using radiosurgery delays neurological death in non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis. The role of radiosurgery has become further accentuated in the era of targeted agents (TA). Thus, the neurologic outcome of radiosurgery in brain metastasis (BM) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was reviewed. We analyzed 135 patients with BM of NSCLC who were administered Cyberknife radiosurgery (CKRS) as either initial or salvage therapy. We evaluated local failure (LF), intracranial failure (IF), and neurological death (ND) due to BM. Primary outcome was neurological death-free survival (NDFS). Median follow-up was 16.2 months. Median CKRS dose of 22 Gy was administered to median 2 targets per patient. Among 99 deaths, 14 (14%) were ND. Upfront treatment for BM included CKRS alone in 85 patients (63%), CKRS + TA in 26 patients (19%), and WBRT in 24 patients (18%). No patients or tumor related factors were associated with ND. However, the type of upfront treatment for BM was significantly associated with ND [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.57) for CKRS + TA, HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for CKRS alone] compared with the WBRT group (P = 0.01). The 2-year NDFS rates for the CKRS + TA, CRKS alone, and WBRT groups were 94%, 87%, and 78%, respectively (P = 0.03). Upfront CKRS showed significantly higher 2-year LF-free survival rate (P < 0.01). IF rate was insignificantly lower in the WBRT group compared with CKRS group (P = 0.38). Upfront CKRS + TA was associated with the best neurological outcome with high NDFS.

1669,"Molecular and behavioral changes in nociception in a novel rat model of chronic pancreatitis for the study of pain. The approach to the management of painful chronic pancreatitis has been empirical, primarily due to the lack of information about biological mechanisms producing pain. To facilitate research into pain mechanisms, our aim was to assess a rat model of chronic pancreatitis induced by pancreatic infusion of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid as a model of painful pancreatitis. Nociception was assessed by measuring mechanical sensitivity of the abdomen and by recording the number of nocifensive behaviors in response to electrical stimulation of the pancreas. Expression of neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in the thoracic dorsal root ganglia receiving input from the pancreas and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the pancreas were measured. Rats with pancreatitis exhibited marked increase in sensitivity to mechanical probing of the abdomen and increased sensitivity to noxious electrical stimulation of the pancreas. There were significant increases in NGF protein in the pancreas and in expression of neuropeptides CGRP and SP in the sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia receiving input from the pancreas. We have established quantitative measures of referred nociception and pancreatic hyperalgesia in a rat model of chronic pancreatitis that bears histological similarities to the human disease. This model has considerable construct, face and predictive validity for the human condition. It is of importance for the study of the pathogenesis of pain in this condition and can facilitate the development of new therapeutic options.",Excluded
42,"Whole cell recordings of intrinsic properties and sound-evoked responses from the inferior colliculus. Response features of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons to both current injections and tone bursts were studied with in vivo whole cell recordings in awake Mexican free-tailed bats. Of 160 cells recorded, 95% displayed one of three general types of discharge patterns in response to the injection of positive current: 1) sustained discharges; 2) adapting discharges; and 3) onset-bursting discharges. Sustained neurons were the most common type (N=78), followed by onset-bursting (N=57). The least common type was adapting (N=17). In 90 neurons the profiles of synaptic and discharge activity evoked by tones of different frequencies at 50 dB SPL were recorded. Three major tone-evoked response profiles were obtained; 1) neurons dominated by excitation (N=32) in which tones evoked excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) or EPSPs with discharges over a range of frequencies with little or no evidence of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by frequencies that flanked the excitation; 2) neurons that had an excitatory frequency region in which discharges were evoked that was flanked by frequencies that evoked predominantly IPSPs (N=26); 3) neurons in which all frequencies evoked IPSPs with little or no depolarizations (N=32). The question we asked is whether IC cells that express a particular profile of PSPs and discharges to acoustic stimulation also have the same current-evoked response profile. We show that, with one exception, the intrinsic features of an IC neuron are not correlated with the pattern of its synaptic innervation; the two features are unrelated in the majority of IC cells. The exception is a subtype of inhibitory dominated cell where most frequencies evoked IPSPs to both the onset and to the offset of the tone bursts. In those cells injected current steps always evoked an onset-bursting response.",Excluded

1151,"Conformational behavior and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in organic solvents: modeling the effects of membranes. Intracellular proteinaceous inclusions (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) of alpha-synuclein are pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple systemic atrophy. The molecular mechanisms underlying the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into such filamentous inclusions remain unknown, although many factors have been implicated, including interactions with lipid membranes. To model the effects of membrane fields on alpha-synuclein, we analyzed the structural and fibrillation properties of this protein in mixtures of water with simple and fluorinated alcohols. All solvents that were studied induced folding of alpha-synuclein, with the common first stage being formation of a partially folded intermediate with an enhanced propensity to fibrillate. Protein fibrillation was completely inhibited due to formation of beta-structure-enriched oligomers with high concentrations of methanol, ethanol, and propanol and moderate concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE), or because of the appearance of a highly alpha-helical conformation at high TFE and hexafluoro-2-propanol concentrations. At least to some extent, these conformational effects mimic those observed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, and can explain some of the observed effects of membranes on alpha-synuclein fibrillation.",Excluded
3120,"Phase I study of weekly nedaplatin and concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer. Nedaplatin is an analog of cisplatin that was developed in Japan, and it exhibits less nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin. This study aimed to determine the recommended dose of weekly nedaplatin chemoradiotherapy in high-risk patients following radical surgery. Fifteen patients who required postoperative pelvic radiotherapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer were enrolled in the present study. Nedaplatin was designed to be administered for eight cycles (minimum five cycles) beginning at a weekly dose of 22.5 mg/m(2) and then escalating to 25, 27.5, and then to 30 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy and/or planned chemotherapy (prior to the completion of five cycles) due to toxicity. Nedaplatin administration was interrupted prior to the completion of five cycles in one of six patients at a dose of 27.5 mg/m(2). A more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy did not occur in any patient. Nedaplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) was safely administered, and two of three patients could receive the planned chemotherapy consisting of eight cycles of weekly nedaplatin. Our recommended weekly nedaplatin dose was determined to be 30 mg/m(2) administered for more than five cycles and up to eight cycles if possible. Weekly administration of nedaplatin may be more tolerable and less toxic than weekly administration of cisplatin.",Excluded
617,"Effects of irradiation on brain vasculature using an in situ tumor model. PURPOSE: Damage to normal tissue is a limiting factor in clinical radiotherapy (RT). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane matrix absent of tumor cells.RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance. Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with and without radiation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation.",Excluded

825,"Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, mda-7/IL-24, selectively induces growth suppression, apoptosis and radiosensitization in malignant gliomas in a p53-independent manner. Malignant gliomas are extremely aggressive cancers currently lacking effective treatment modalities. Gene therapy represents a promising approach for this disease. A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",Excluded

An entity's existence in an image can be depicted by the activity instantiation vector from a group of neurons (called capsule).

This research utilizes the prowess of this algorithm to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray (CXR) images.

3481,"Differential expression of KCC2 accounts for the differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb. The rat olfactory bulb is anatomically immature at birth, and considerable neurogenesis and synaptogenesis are known to take place postnatally. In addition, significant physiological changes have also been reported in this period. For example, granule cell-mediated inhibition following electrical stimulations to the lateral olfactory tract is robust during the first postnatal week, and then decreases abruptly after the second week. However, the mechanism underlying this enhanced inhibition remains to be elucidated. To know the cause of this phenomenon, we investigated the expression patterns of cation-Cl(-) co-transporters (KCC1, KCC2 and NKCC1) mRNAs, which are responsible for the regulation of [Cl(-)](i). In addition, responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measured by gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings and Ca(2+) imaging using fura-2. We found that in the early postnatal period, mitral cells expressing KCC2 mRNA were inhibited by GABA, while granule cells lacking KCC2 mRNA expression were depolarized or excited by GABA. These results indicate that transient GABA-mediated excitation on granule cells might be the main cause of the enhanced inhibition on mitral cells, and suggest that these differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons play pivotal roles in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb.",Excluded
2828,"Monkey, rat, and first in human evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]PF- 06445974, a PET radioligand that preferentially labels phosphodiesterase 4B. Introduction: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) metabolizes and terminates the actions of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 has four isozymes: A, B, C, and D. PDE4B and PDE4D have the highest expression in brain and are linked to cognitive deficits as well as major depressive disorder (MDD). This PET study assessed the newly developed PDE4B-selective radioligand [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 in rats, rhesus monkeys and, for the first time, humans. A concomitant goal was to determine whether [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 could accurately quantify PDE4 in human brain. Method(s): In two human subjects, two whole body PET scans for radiation exposure dosimetry and three brain PET scans for specific PDE4B quantification were performed. In the pharmacokinetic analysis, target enzyme density was quantified as total distribution volume (V ) using the two-tissue compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. In one male rhesus monkey, four PET whole body scans were performed on different days. The first scan was acquired under baseline conditions, and rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), a PDE4 inhibitor, was administered IV in the second scan. The same baseline and blocked paradigms were repeated with PF- 06445974 (0.1 mg/kg) as the blocking drug. Finally, brain PET scans were conducted in four rats. Concentration of radioactivity as standardized uptake value (SUV) was compared across conditions and species. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 readily entered human brain and showed widespread distribution, with lower binding in cerebellum. V was well identified in all examined brain regions, and V calculated from the first 90 min of scan data fell within 10%. V was highest in thalamus and striatum, broadly matching human brain RNA expression. Wholebody imaging in the two humans and one monkey was notable for early distribution in the blood pool, accumulation in target organs (i.e., brain, lung), and excretion via urinary tract. Doses in the two humans were 19.6 and 19.3 muSV/MBq, respectively, similar to the value extrapolated from monkey (16.5 muSv/MBq). In monkey blocking scans, both drugs substantially blocked brain uptake; at 60 min, rolipram blocked 78% of uptake and PF-06445974 blocked 92%. However, for the rolipram-blocked scan, radioactivity in brain increased after 20 min and returned to baseline by the end of the scan. Rats showed a similar pattern to monkey. To assess whether this was due to radiometabolite in brain or rapid rolipram clearance, a second rolipram dose was injected as a displacing agent at 120 min in a rat that had undergone pre-injection of 1 mg/kg iv. This repeat rolipram dose replenished rolipram concentrations in brain and restored its ability to block radioligand binding, proving that no radiometabolite entered rat or monkey brain. Conclusion(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 successfully imaged and quantified PDE4B in human brain. No radiometabolite contamination occurred, reflecting parent radioligand binding to PDE4 in brain. In nonhuman primates,, rolipram washed out more quickly than PF-06445974. Fig.1 In human brain, [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 had widespread distribution, with high uptake in striatum and thalamus.

BACKGROUND: Petroclival meningiomas (PCMs) were once regarded as 'inoperable' due to their complex anatomy and limited surgical exposure. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgically treated PCMs larger than 2 cm.METHODS: A series of 199 consecutive patients (137 females, 68.8 %) with PCMs larger than 2 cm from between 1993 and 2003 were included. The clinical charts, radiographs, and follow-ups were evaluated.RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 111 (55.8 %) patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 65, and partial resection (PR) in 23. Cranial nerve dysfunctions were the most common complications and occurred in 133 (66.8 %) cases. The surgical mortality was 2.0 %. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores significantly decreased 1 month after the operations (preoperative KPS = 76.8 and postoperative KPS = 64.8; p = 0.011, Paired-samples t test). Long-term follow-ups were obtained in 142 patients, the follow-up duration was 171.6 months, and the most recent KPS was 83.2. Permanent morbidities remained in 24 patients (18.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that brainstem edema and tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter were independent risk factors in terms of outcomes (KPS < 80). The recurrence/progression rates were 14.5, 31.8, and 53.3 % for the GTR, STR, and PR cases, respectively (p = 0.002, Pearson chi (2) test). Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the remnants exhibited good tumor control.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes and low mortality were achieved with the microsurgical management of medium and large PCMs; however, the rates of cranial nerves dysfunction remained high. Radically aggressive resection might not be judicious in terms of postoperative morbidity. The preoperative evaluations and intraoperative findings were informative regarding the outcomes. The low follow-up rate likely compromised our findings, and additional consecutive studies were required.",Excluded

The effects of chronic, low-dose amitriptyline on serotonin (5-HT) synthesis rate were measured in rat brain using autoradiography and the trapping of alpha-[14C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[14C]-MTrp). Rats received amitriptyline (2 mg/kg per day) or saline via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps for 21 days. Amitriptyline had no effect on any physiological parameters measured, or on free or total plasma tryptophan levels. However, amitriptyline exerted selective decreases of 15% and 17% (P < 0.001) in serotonin synthesis rates in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, respectively. There was no reduction in any of the projection areas studied, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus or striatum. The data suggest that chronic low doses of amitriptyline can lead to sustained 5-HT re-uptake inhibition selectively in the raphe nuclei, an effect compatible with tonic activation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT synthesis. The failure of chronic amitriptyline treatment to affect 5-HT synthesis rate in the projection areas may ensure an adequate regulation of pain pathways implicated in migraine headache, an effect possibly related to amitriptyline anti-migraine efficacy.",Excluded

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Generate an age appropriate differential for retinal artery occlusion CASE: A 20 year-old healthy woman presented with acute left lower quadrant vision loss. She reported a similar episode 1 week prior after which her vision recovered, as well as a month-long history of left-sided temporal headaches associated with photosensitivity. Review of systems was positive for episodic paresthesias of bilateral forearms, hands, and feet. She denied constitutional symptoms, rash, joint pain, and drug use of any kind. Family history was remarkable for father with ocular migraine, and grandparents with rheumatoid arthritis and neurosarcoidosis. Exam revealed a left monocular lower quandrantanopsia, normal venous pulsations, no cherry red spot and a normal neurological exam. An extensive rheumatic and infectious workup was negative, including a hypercoaguability panel, antinuclear antibody, ESR, CRP, and hemoglobin evaluation. A brain MRI/MRA without contrast showed patent bilateral ophthalmic arteries. Face and neck MRI with contrast, transthoracic echocardiography with bubble study, electromyography, as well as nerve conduction studies were all unremarkable. Given the negative workup, the presumable etiology was thought to be vasospasm with migraine. She was started on low dose aspirin for secondary stroke prevention, and propranolol for migraine prophylaxis. IMPACT: This case highlights the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion, as well as the possible etiologies of retinal artery occlusion. Workup should be tailored to an age appropriate differential. DISCUSSION: Overall, central and branch retinal artery occlusions (CRAO and BRAO) are rare with an incidence of approximately 1 to 10 in 100,000, with an affected mean age of 60-65 years. The etiology varies with age, with carotid artery atherosclerosis being most common overall, as high as 70%; however, for patients less than 40 years of age, cardiogenic embolism is much more likely. Therefore, workup for younger patients should be focused on evaluating for sources of cardiogenic embolism such as arrhythmias, murmurs, congenital heart disease, and substance abuse. For older patients, temporal arteritis should be ruled out. Vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, radiation injury, or hematologic diseases including sickle cell anemia, hypercoagulable states, and hyperviscosity syndrome can affect all ages and should be investigated if other causes are excluded. Rare causes of CRAO/BRAO include infections due to Bartonella, toxoplasmosis, and varicella; ocular surgery; fat or amniotic fluid embolism; and vasospasm with or without migraine, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. There have only been case studies describing CRAO associated with vasculitis.",Excluded
1253,"Association Between Radiation Necrosis and Tumor Biology After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis. BACKGROUND: The primary dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is radiation necrosis (RN), which occurs after approximately 5% to 10% of treatments. This adverse event may worsen neurologic deficits, increase the frequency and cost of imaging, and necessitate prolonged treatment with steroids or antiangiogenic agents. Previous investigations have primarily identified lesion size and dosimetric constraints as risk factors for RN in small populations. We hypothesized that disease histology, receptor status, and mutational status are associated with RN.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients presenting with brain metastasis between 1997 and 2015 who underwent SRS and subsequent radiographic follow-up at a single tertiary-care institution were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of radiographic RN. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to identify biological risk factors for RN.RESULTS: 1939 patients (5747 lesions) were eligible for inclusion; 285 patients (15%) experienced radiographic RN after the treatment of 427 (7%) lesions. After SRS, the median time to RN was 7.6 months. After multivariate analysis, graded prognostic assessment, renal pathology, lesion diameter, and the heterogeneity index remained independently predictive of RN in the pooled cohort. In subset analyses of individual pathologies, HER2-amplified status (hazard ratio [HR] 2.05, P=.02), BRAF V600+ mutational status (HR 0.33, P=.04), lung adenocarcinoma histology (HR 1.89, P=.04), and ALK rearrangement (HR 6.36, P<.01) were also associated with RN.CONCLUSIONS: In the present investigation constituting the largest series of RN, several novel risk factors were identified, including renal histology, lung adenocarcinoma histology, HER2 amplification, and ALK/BRAF mutational status. These risk factors may be used to guide clinical trial design incorporating biological risk stratification or dose escalation. Future studies determining the optimal timing of targeted therapies are warranted to further define the risk of RN.",Excluded

RATIONALE: The clinical prognosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) patients is poor. Therefore, effective treatment is still a challenge at present. Moreover, little is known about the value of radiotherapy in the treatment of PTCL-NOS.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old male patient with eating difficulties and progressive exacerbation for 3 months was diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Airway compression occurred after 2 cycles of first line treatment with cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone regimen, radiotherapy (48Gy/24f) was given as the second line therapy.DIAGNOSIS: After radiotherapy, the patient complained that mild intermittent dysphagia still existed. Endoscopic biopsy of the upper digestive tract confirmed necrotic material and superficial squamous epithelial mucosa, suggesting esophageal stricture after radiotherapy, which was indistinguishable from tumor residue.INTERVENTIONS: The patient received anti-inflammatory treatment outside the hospital and did not receive any other special treatment.OUTCOMES: The symptoms of dysphagia disappeared and the focus showed complete response (CR). As of October 1, 2020, the patient has been diagnosed with PTCL-NOS for more than 57 months and the overall survival (OS) have not been achieved.LESSONS: Radiotherapy has obvious and rapid anti-tumor effect on cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone refractory PTCL-NOS. At the same time, hollow organs after radiotherapy can lead to lumen stenosis and the symptoms of suspected recurrence which is difficult to distinguish only from the imaging findings.",Excluded
738,"Habituation of steady-state visual evoked potentials in response to high-frequency polychromatic foveal visual stimulation. In an attempt to develop safe and robust methods for monitoring migraineurs' brain states, we explores the feasibility of using white, red, green and blue LED lights flickering around their critical flicker fusion (CFF) frequencies as foveal visual stimuli for inducing steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and causing discernible habituation trends. After comparing the habituation indices, the multi-scale entropies and the time dependent intrinsic correlations of their SSVEP signals, we reached a tentative conclusion that sharp red and white light pulses flickering barely above their CFF frequencies can replace commonly used 13Hz stimuli to effectively cause SSVEP habituation among normal subjects. Empirical results showed that consecutive short bursts of light can produce more consistent responses than a single prolonged stimulation. Since these high frequency stimuli do not run the risk of triggering migraine or seizure attacks, further tests of these stimuli on migraine patients are warranted in order to verify their effectiveness.",Excluded
3350,"Textiloma mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma. Introduction: Textiloma (Txm) is defined as a foreign body-related inflammatory pseudotumor arising from retained nonabsorbable cotton matrix with the associated inflammatory reaction. In current neurosurgical practice, Txm often refers to a resorbable hemostatic agent that is intentionally left in place to prevent the potentially disastrous consequences of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage. Imaging is essential to the workup for Txm, but it cannot be easily distinguished from a recurrent tumor or abscess due to their nonspecific characteristics. Parameter calculations of diffusion weighted imaging are based on complex pharmacokinetic compartment models that allow only an approximation of the biological conditions. This report describes a case of a Txm mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma including altered advanced neuroimaging techniques in an effort to highlight this possibility in the setting of tumoral recurrence. Materials And Methods: A 69-year-old female presented to our facility with a 6-month history of progressive left-sided weakness. Neuroimaging studies revealed a large non-enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal lobe. Pathology reported a diffuse astrocytoma, WHO grade II with wildtype IDH-1, EGFR amplification and PTEN negative results. After surgical intervention, external beam radiation was given to the remaining areas of residual tumor. Routine MRI revealed a nodular area of contrast enhancement in the dorsal and inferior margin of the biopsy tract, growing between interval scans, perfusion-weighted imaging parameters were elevated, clinically asymptomatic. Result(s): She underwent a complete resection of this area of interest and pathology returned as a Txm with surgicel fibers. Reactive changes were also seen consistent with radiation effect and areas of atypical cells consistent with residual tumor but not significantly mitotically active. She did notrequire any further treatments and was on observation with imaging only for 14 months until another area of progression was seen. Conclusion(s): After treatment of a neoplasm, if unexpected clinical or imaging evidence of recurrence is present, it may be a foreign body reaction to hemostatic material used during the initial surgery. The implications of this case lie in recognizing this entity to avoid unnecessary procedures. Given the technical variability of advanced MRI techniques, there are limits to the sensitivity and specificity of such. The standardization of advanced MRI is well recognized as a pressing clinical and research need.",Excluded
2624,"Wavelength-dependent change of retinal nerve fiber layer reflectance in glaucomatous retinas. PURPOSE: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) reflectance is often used in optical methods for RNFL assessment in clinical diagnosis of glaucoma, yet little is known about the reflectance property of the RNFL under the development of glaucoma. This study measured the changes in RNFL reflectance spectra that occurred in retinal nerve fiber bundles with different degrees of glaucomatous damage.METHODS: A rat model of glaucoma with laser photocoagulation of trabecular meshwork was used. Reflectance of the RNFL in an isolated retina was measured at wavelengths of 400-830 nm. Cytostructural distribution of the bundles measured optically was evaluated by confocal imaging of immunohistochemistry staining of cytoskeletal components, F-actin, microtubules, and neurofilaments. RNFL reflectance spectra were studied in bundles with normal-looking appearance, early F-actin distortion, and apparent damage of all cytoskeletal components. Changes of RNFL reflectance spectra were studied at different radii (0.22, 0.33, and 0.44 mm) from the optic nerve head (ONH).RESULTS: Bundles in 30 control retinas and 41 glaucomatous retinas were examined. In normal retinas, reflectance spectra were similar along the same bundles. In glaucomatous retinas, reflectance spectra changed along bundles with the spectra becoming flatter as bundle areas approached the ONH.CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) causes nonuniform changes in RNFL reflectance across wavelengths. Changes of reflectance spectra occur early in bundles near the ONH and prior to apparent cytoskeletal distortion. Using the ratio of RNFL reflectance measured at different wavelengths can provide early and sensitive detection of glaucomatous damage.",Excluded

A mutant, uvs-(SA3B), which shows high sensitivity to UV light segregated among the progeny in a back-cross of a presumptive MMS-sensitive mutant to a wild-type strain. At 37% survival, this mutant was approximately 5 times more sensitive to UV and also 6 times more sensitive to 4-NQO than the wild type. But it was only slightly sensitive to gamma-ray, MMS, MNNG, MTC and histidine. It showed an unusual photoreactivation response. Its time course of photorecovery was similar to the photoreactivation-defective strain upr-1 of Neurospora crassa. Mutation induction by UV at the ad-3 loci in this mutant strain was lower than that at the same loci in the wild-type strain. The uvs-(SA3B) mutant maps between met-1 and col-4 in linkage group IV, and it was not allelic with the mutagen-sensitive mutant mus-8 which is located in this area. We have concluded, therefore, that uvs-(SA3B) has resulted from mutation in a new DNA-repair gene. This new mutant was barren in homozygous crosses.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the use of targeted or immunotherapy (TT/IT) in combination with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with melanoma brain metastasis (MBM). Therefore, we analyzed the outcome and toxicity of SRS alone compared to SRS in combination with TT/IT.METHODS: Patients with MBM treated with single session SRS at our department between 2014 and 2017 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months after first SRS were included. The primary endpoint of this study was local control (LC). Secondary endpoints were distant intracranial control, radiation necrosis-free survival (RNFS), and overall survival (OS). The local/ distant intracranial control rates, RNFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to test differences between groups. Cox proportional hazard model was performed for univariate continuous variables and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (17 male and 11 female) with 52 SRS-lesions were included. The median follow-up was 19 months (range 14-24 months) after first SRS. Thirty-six lesions (69.2%) were treated with TT/IT simultaneously (4 weeks before and 4 weeks after SRS), while 16 lesions (30.8%) were treated with SRS alone or with sequential TT/IT. The 1-year local control rate was 100 and 83.3% for SRS with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.023), respectively. The estimated 1-year RNFS was 90.0 and 82.1% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.935). The distant intracranial control rate after 1 year was 47.7 and 50% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.933). On univariate analysis, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment including the BRAF status (Melanoma-molGPA) was associated with a significantly improved LC. Neither gender nor SRS-PTV margin had a prognostic impact on LC. V10 and V12 were significantly associated with RNFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: SRS with simultaneous TT/IT significantly improved LC with no significant difference in radiation necrosis rate. The therapy combination appears to be effective and safe. However, prospective studies on SRS with simultaneous TT/IT are necessary and ongoing.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The institutional review board approved this analysis on 10th of February 2015 and all patients signed informed consent (UE nr. 128-14).",Excluded

Long-term primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) survivors could have multiple adverse prognostic factors at diagnosis such as age, performance status (PS), site of the tumour (deep vs superficial), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and CSF protein level. Whether these five prognostic factors integrated in the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score have a time-dependent effect is questionable. Among 132 PCNSL patients treated at our institution between 1984 and 2006, 91 available patients for IELSG score were evaluated by time-segmented analysis. Of the 91 patients, 21% had 0-1, 59% had 2-3 and 20% had 4-5 adverse IELSG prognostic scores. With a median follow-up of 102months, the median overall survival (OS) of the 91 patients with the five prognostic factors of IELSG score was 33months (95% CI, 17 to 55) compared with 14months (95% CI, 3 to 23) for the remaining 41 patients whose CSF protein level was lacking in the IELSG score. These 41 patients who did not have lumbar puncture presented a poorer PS at diagnosis and a lower treatment response rate. While confirming the prognostic value of the IELSG score, we observed a time-dependent effect of age, PS and tumour site; all three lost their prognostic value after 6months from diagnosis, while LDH remained a constant predictor of OS. No prognostic impact of CSF protein level was reported. Patients with older age, poor PS and deep brain involvement are at risk of death during the first months after diagnosis but could have a favourable long-term outcome after the treatment period. New prognostic factors predicting long-term outcome remain to be determined. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the actual dose variability to the targets and organs at risk (OARs) during nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to investigate the significance of replanning.METHODS: 11 NPC patients were included in this study. Each patient had both a planning CT and weekly repeated CT. Simulated plans that were generated by using the same beam configurations mapped to the repeated CT represented the actual delivered doses to the target volumes and OARs. An IMRT replanning was performed with the fifth week CT scan. Doses among the initial plan, the simulated plans and replanning were compared.RESULTS: There were no significant dosimetric differences in the gross tumour volume, clinical target volume (CTV) 1 or CTV2 for either the simulated plans or the replanning compared with the initial plan. Dosimetric variability of both parotid glands and the brain stem were unique to each individual, and doses to the spinal cord were always maintained within the limit. Replanning in the fifth week had significantly decreased the doses delivered to both parotids (p-values of the mean dose were 0.015 and 0.026 for the left and right parotid, respectively), whereas it did not reduce the doses to the brain stem and spinal cord. There was no relationship between dose variability and weight loss.CONCLUSIONS: There are no significant dose changes for target volumes and spinal cord, and doses to the brain stem and both parotid glands changed individually during NPC IMRT. Replanning helps to spare bilateral parotids.",Excluded

1397,"Redox balance- and radiation-mediated alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis. Changes in the intracellular and extracellular redox balance have been correlated with cell fate decisions in terms of proliferation versus differentiation, entering versus existing cell cycle and survival versus cell death. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been correlated with neuronal plasticity of learning and memory; however, the process is exquisitely sensitive to changes in redox balance. Cranial irradiation is an effective modality in treating brain tumours but often leads to deficits in hippocampus-related learning and memory, which is most likely due to sustained elevation of oxygen free radical production and suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. The subcellular redox environment affecting hippocampal neurogenesis is largely unknown. Using mutant mice deficient in each one of the three superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) isoforms, we have begun to determine the consequences of SOD deficiency in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions of learning and memory under normal condition and following cranial irradiation.",Excluded

The annual incidence per 100,000 people ranges from two to seven for women and from one to five for men. Since the first study was published in 1970, only eight major epidemiologic studies have been done that attempted to identify risk factors for meningioma. Ionizing radiation and head trauma have emerged as the most promising etiologic risk factors. In these studies, radiation doses as low as 1-2 Gy have been associated with increased risk. The role of dental radiographs has been suggested in some studies but not supported in others. An explanation for the apparent excess of meningiomas in women remains obscure. The potential effects of endogenous or exogenous sex hormones on tumor induction or growth remain unexplored in epidemiologic studies. More should be learned about the risk factors for meningioma in search of opportunities for prevention. [References: 87]",Excluded

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of salvage stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for recurrent glioma. From August 2008 to December 2012, 30 patients with recurrent glioma underwent salvage SRT. The initial histological diagnoses were World Health Organization (WHO) grades II, III, and IV in 6, 9, and 15 patients, respectively. Morphologically, the type of recurrence was classified as diffuse or other. Two methods of clinical target delineation were used: A, a contrast-enhancing tumor; or B, a contrast-enhancing tumor with a 3-10-mm margin and/or surrounding fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) high-intensity areas. The prescribed dose was 22.5-35 Gy delivered in five fractions at an isocenter using a dynamic conformal arc technique. The overall survival (OS) and local control probability (LCP) after SRT were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A univariate analysis was used to test the effect of clinical variables on OS/LCP. The median follow-up period was 272 days after SRT. The OS and LCP were 83% and 56% at 6 months after SRT, respectively. Morphologically, the tumor type correlated significantly with both OS and LCP (P = 0.006 and <0.001, respectively). The method of target delineation also had a significant influence on LCP (P = 0.016). Grade 3 radiation necrosis was observed in two patients according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3. Salvage SRT was safe and effective for recurrent glioma, especially non-diffuse recurrences. Improved local control might be obtained by adding a margin to contrast-enhancing tumors or including increased FLAIR high-intensity areas.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy remains the standard of treatment for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to determine if the deferral of brain radiotherapy impacts patient outcomes.METHODS: Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred brain radiotherapy after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17.9 months vs 12.6 months; P=0.038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4.0 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20.0 months vs 10.7 months; P<0.01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17.9 months vs 15.2 months; P=0.289).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of deferred brain radiotherapy may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

1891,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-beta2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts.",Excluded

However visual acuity is usually determined only in narrow range of luminance levels between 160 and 320 cd/m2; therefore losses of visual acuity in other ranges of light intensity can not be detected. In a distance of 80 cm from the patients eyes, Landolt rings of varying sizes were presented on a small test field whose light intensity can be varied between 0.1 and 30,000 cd/m2. Thereby an acuity-luminance-function can be obtained. We studied such functions under different conditions of exposure time both with constant and with increasing luminance of the test field. We found that persons with normal vision can increase their visual acuity with increasing test field luminance up to a range of 5000 cd/m2. The maximum values of visual acuity under optimal lightening conditions lie (varying with age) between 2.2 and 0.9. Under pathological conditions visual acuity falls at high luminances accompanied by sensations of glare. Tests of glare sensitivity as a function of exposure time showed 4 sec to be a critical time of exposure since after 4 sec normal persons just reach their maximum visual acuity at high luminances. The underlying physiological mechanisms lead us to suppose that patients with neuronal light adaptation disturbances display a greater visual loss as a result of decreased time of exposure than those with disturbances in the ocular media. Visual acuity as well as the capacity to increase the patients visual acuity under optimal conditions of lighting were both found to be strongly age-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
300,"Acute remapping within the motor system induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of human primary motor cortex (M1) changes cortical excitability at the site of stimulation and at distant sites without affecting simple motor performance. The aim of this study was to explore how rTMS changes regional excitability and how the motor system compensates for these changes. Using functional brain imaging, activation was mapped at rest and during freely selected finger movements after 30 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS increased synaptic activity in the stimulated left M1 and induced widespread changes in activity throughout areas engaged by the task. In particular, movement-related activity in the premotor cortex of the nonstimulated hemisphere increased after 1 Hz rTMS. Analyses of effective connectivity confirmed that the stimulated part of M1 became less responsive to input from premotor and mesial motor areas. Conversely, after rTMS our results were consistent with increased coupling between an inferomedial portion of left M1 and anterior motor areas. These results are important for three reasons. First, they show changes in motor excitability to central inputs from other cortical areas (as opposed to peripheral or exogenous inputs used in previous studies). Second, they suggest that maintenance of task performance may involve activation of premotor areas contralateral to the site of rTMS, similar to that seen in stroke patients. Third, changes in motor activations at the site of rTMS suggest an rTMS-induced remodeling of motor representations during movement. This remapping may provide a neural substrate for acute compensatory plasticity of the motor system in response to focal lesions such as stroke.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between neurocognitive function (NCF) and quality of life (QOL) in patients with brain metastases after whole-brain radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 208 patients from the whole-brain radiotherapy arm of a Phase III trial (PCI-P120-9801), who underwent regular NCF and QOL (ADL [activities of daily living] and FACT-Br [Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain-specific]) testing, were analyzed. Spearman's rank correlation was calculated between NCF and QOL, using each patient's own data, at each time point. To test the hypothesis that NCF declines before QOL changes, the predictive effect of NCF from previous visits on QOL was studied with a linear mixed-effects model. Neurocognitive function or QOL deterioration was defined relative to each patient's own baseline. Lead or lag time, defined as NCF deterioration before or after the date of QOL decline, respectively, was computed.RESULTS: At baseline, all NCF tests showed statistically significant correlations with ADL, which became stronger at 4 months. A similar observation was made with FACT-Br. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits predicted ADL (p < 0.05 for seven of eight tests) or FACT-Br. Scores on all eight NCF tests deteriorated before ADL decline (net lead time 9-153 days); and scores on six of eight NCF tests deteriorated before FACT-Br (net lead time 9-82 days).CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive function and QOL are correlated. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits are predictive of QOL. Neurocognitive function deterioration precedes QOL decline. The sequential association between NCF and QOL decline suggests that delaying NCF deterioration is a worthwhile treatment goal in brain metastases patients.",Excluded

Planarians have robust regenerative ability dependent on X-ray-sensitive pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts. Here, we report that planarians can regenerate dopaminergic neurons after selective degeneration of these neurons caused by treatment with a dopaminergic neurotoxin (6-hydroxydopamine; 6-OHDA). This suggests that planarians have a system to sense the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and to recruit stem cells to produce dopaminergic neurons to recover brain morphology and function. We confirmed that X-ray-irradiated planarians do not regenerate brain dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA-induced lesioning, suggesting that newly generated dopaminergic neurons are indeed derived from pluripotent stem cells. However, we found that the majority of regenerated dopaminergic neurons were 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-negative cells. Therefore, we carefully analyzed when proliferating stem cells became committed to become dopaminergic neurons during regeneration by a combination of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, immunostaining/in situ hybridization, and 5-fluorouracil treatment. The results strongly suggested that G(2) -phase stem cells become committed to dopaminergic neurons in the mesenchymal space around the brain, after migration from the trunk region following S-phase.

After anesthetizing this nerve with local anesthetic, the same needle is withdrawn to the skin with the tip still in the subcutaneous tissue and repositioned to block the medial branch above, and thereafter below, while continuing to use only the antero-posterior view, thereby using only one entry site.CONCLUSIONS: When performed correctly, the single needle technique provides accuracy similar to the more conventional multiple needle approach during the performance of diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks. Because only one skin entry point is needed, however, this technique may afford several advantages over the multiple needle approach. These may include less patient discomfort, less time required and less radiation exposure since only one C-arm position is used, a smaller volume of local anesthetic, and possibly a lower incidence of false-positive blocks.",Excluded
2743,"Atypical retardation patterns in scanning laser polarimetry are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness. PURPOSE: Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) results can be affected by an atypical retardation pattern (ARP). One reason for an ARP is the birefringence of the sclera. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the peripapillary choroidal thickness (pChTh) on the occurrence of ARP.METHODS: One hundred ten healthy subjects were investigated with SLP and spectral domain OCT. pChTh was measured in B-scan images at 768 positions using semiautomatic software. Values were averaged to 32 sectors and the total peripapillary mean. Subjects were divided into four groups according to the typical scan score (TSS) provided by the GDxVCC: group 1 TSS, 100; group 2 TSS, 90-99; group 3 TSS, 80-89; group 4 TSS, <80.RESULTS: Mean pChTh (+/- SD) in 110 healthy subjects was 141 mum (+/-49 mum). There was a significant correlation between pChTh and TSS (r = 0.608; P < 0.001). In TSS groups 1 to 4, mean pChTh was 168 mum (+/-38 mum), 148 mum (+/- 48 mum), 119 mum (+/-35 mum), and 92 (+/-42 mum). Mean pChTh of TSS groups 3 and 4 was significantly lower than that of TSS group 1 (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Low values of TSS resulting from the appearance of ARP in SLP are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness. Reduced choroidal thickness may result in an increased amount of confounding light getting to the SLP light detectors.",Excluded

Single-fraction radiation therapy with 5 or 15 Gy (60)Co gamma radiation was combined with intraperitoneal injections of syngeneic interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-transfected cells in rats with intracerebral N29 or N32 glioma tumors at days 7, 21 and 35 after inoculation. For intracerebral N29 tumors, single-fraction radiation therapy with 5 or 15 Gy had no significant effect on the survival time. Immunization with IFN-gamma-transfected N29 cells significantly increased the survival time by 61%. Single-fraction radiation therapy with 5 Gy combined with immunization increased the survival time significantly by 87% and complete remissions by 75% while with 15 Gy the survival time increased 45% with 38% complete remissions. For intracerebral N32 tumors, single-fraction radiation therapy with 15 Gy increased the survival time significantly by 20%. Immunization by itself had no significant effect with IFN-gamma-transfected N32 cells, but combined with 15 Gy single-fraction radiation therapy it increased survival time significantly by 40%, although there were no complete remissions. Based on these findings, we suggest a new therapeutic regimen for malignant glioma using single-fraction radiation therapy with a target absorbed dose of the order of 5-10 Gy combined with clinically verified immunotherapy.",Excluded
272,"Invasive tracheal metastasis: Fatal complication of stereotactic body radiation therapy. Introduction: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important and increasing public health threat in the developed world. In the US 17 % of patients diagnosed with de novo RCC present with metastatic disease most often to lung (50-60%), bone (30-40%), liver (20%) and brain (5-11%). No treatment is effective for majority of patients with systemic disease; median survival time of those with metastatic disease is 6-12 months with a 2-year survival rate of 10-20%<sup>1</sup>. Stereotactic body high-dose fraction radiation therapy (SBRT) has shown a high local control rate however it is not without complications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66 year old male with medical history of RCC clear cell type s/p left nephrectomy in 2007 with metastasis to bone presented to clinic with persistent cough and submassive hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy revealed tracheal mass nearly obstructing the tracheal lumen 1 cm proximal to main carina. Endobronchial biopsy, cytology brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage were all negative for malignant cells. PET/CT showed avidity with SUV 5.0 in distal trachea. Multidisciplinary discussion occurred and decision was made to proceed with SBRT for presumptive metastatic renal cell carcinoma with tracheal invasion. Patient completed 5000 cGy radiation in 5 equal fractions with improvement in symptoms. Repeat bronchoscopy 4 months after SBRT therapy revealed necrotic tracheal tissue with concern of mediastinitis. Hospitalization 5 months after SBRT was due to recurrence of submassive hemoptysis. Repeat CT chest revealed acute mediastinitis with aortic ulceration of ascending aorta. Patient also reported expectorating pieces of thick tissue found to be remnants of tracheal cartilage. Rapid decline in hemodynamic status ensued and patient subsequently exsanguinated from ultimate aortic perforation. DISCUSSION: Without definitive therapy this patient would almost certainly have died of metastatic carcinoma to trachea. The patient could also die from aggressive treatment in context of treatment-related complications affecting lung parenchyma and adjacent vasculature. Conclusion(s): SBRT continuously evolves and is at the precipice of the technological advancements in image guidance, dosimetric parameters, and radiation delivery to direct radiation ablation doses to tumors. Careful evaluation and management of patients in multidisciplinary clinical setting, as well as a very thorough informed consent process are essential to ensuring the best possible treatment and outcome.",Excluded

This expert opinion paper on cardiac imaging after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) includes a statement of the ""Heart and Brain"" consortium of the German Cardiac Society and the German Stroke Society. The Stroke Unit-Commission of the German Stroke Society and the German Atrial Fibrillation NETwork (AFNET) endorsed this paper. Cardiac imaging is a key component of etiological work-up after stroke. Enhanced echocardiographic tools, constantly improving cardiac computer tomography (CT) as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer comprehensive non- or less-invasive cardiac evaluation at the expense of increased costs and/or radiation exposure. Certain imaging findings usually lead to a change in medical secondary stroke prevention or may influence medical treatment. However, there is no proof from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that the choice of the imaging method influences the prognosis of stroke patients. Summarizing present knowledge, the German Heart and Brain consortium proposes an interdisciplinary, staged standard diagnostic scheme for the detection of risk factors of cardio-embolic stroke. This expert opinion paper aims to give practical advice to physicians who are involved in stroke care. In line with the nature of an expert opinion paper, labeling of classes of recommendations is not provided, since many statements are based on expert opinion, reported case series, and clinical experience.",Excluded
3571,"Accelerated recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia is associated with increased functional brain connectivity in the high-gamma bandwidth. Recent data from our laboratory demonstrate that high-frequency gamma connectivity across the cortex is present during consciousness and depressed during unconsciousness. However, these data were derived fromstatic and well-defined states of arousal rather than during transitions that would suggest functional relevance. We also recently found that subanesthetic ketamine administered during isoflurane anesthesia accelerates recovery upon discontinuation of the primary anesthetic and increases gamma power during emergence. In the current study we re-analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG) data to test the hypothesis that functional cortical connectivity between anterior and posterior cortical regions would be increased during accelerated recovery induced by ketamine when compared to saline-treated controls. Rodents were instrumented with intracranial EEG electrodes and general anesthesia was induced with isoflurane anesthesia. After 37.5 min of continuous isoflurane anesthesia, a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (25 mg/kg intraperitoneal) was administered, with evidence of a 44% reduction in emergence time. In this study, we analyzed gamma and theta coherence (measure of undirected functional connectivity) and normalized symbolic transfer entropy (measure of directed functional connectivity) between frontal and parietal cortices during various levels of consciousness, with a focus on emergence from isoflurane anesthesia. During accelerated emergence in the ketamine-treated group, there was increased frontal-parietal coherence {p = 0.005, 0.05-0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI)]} and normalized symbolic transfer entropy [frontal to parietal: p < 0.001, 0.010-0.026 (95% CI); parietal to frontal: p < 0.001, 0.009-0.025 (95% CI)] in high-frequency gamma bandwidth as compared with the saline-treated group. Surrogates of cortical information exchange in high-frequency gamma are increased in association with accelerated recovery from anesthesia. This finding adds evidence suggesting a functional significance of high-gamma information transfer in consciousness. Copyright © 2017 Li, Hambrecht-Wiedbusch and Mashour.",Excluded

We compared the acute effects of different doses of 630 nm light-emitting diode therapy (LEDT) on skeletal muscle inflammation and hyperalgesia in rats submitted to exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Wistar rats were divided into five experimental groups (n = 5-8/group): sedentary control (CON); exercise + passive recovery (PR); and exercise + LEDT (1.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1.8 J; 4.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 6.3 J; 10.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 15 J). After 100 min of swimming, the rats in the LEDT groups were exposed to phototherapy on the triceps surae muscle. For mechanical hyperalgesia evaluation, paw withdrawal threshold was assessed before and 24 h after swimming. Immediately after hyperalgesia tests, blood samples were collected to analyze creatine kinase (CK) activity and the soleus muscle was removed for histological and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha immunohistological analyses. In all LEDT groups, plasma CK activity was reduced to levels similar to those measured in the CON group. Paw withdrawal threshold decreased in the PR group (- 11.9 +/- 1.9 g) when compared to the CON group (2.2 +/- 1.5 g; p < 0.01) and it was attenuated in the group LEDT 4.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (- 3.3 +/- 2.4 g, p < 0.05).

PURPOSE: In response to growing concern about the effect of blue light on ocular tissue, companies have created mobile device screen protectors to block blue light. This project evaluates one of these screen protectors' ability to reduce blue light intensity.METHODS: The intensity of light at 450 nm from an iPhone 8, iPhone X, and iPad was measured in a dark room. The averages of three measurements were taken with and without the screen protector at different distances, settings of brightness, and Apple's night shift (NS) mode. Results were analyzed using paired t-tests.RESULTS: At 33 cm, 100% brightness, and 0% NS, the screen protector decreased intensity by 43.9%, 32.3%, and 34.9% for the iPhone 8, iPhone X, and iPad, respectively. At 33 cm and 100% brightness, increasing NS mode from 0% to 100% decreased intensity by 81.2%, 84.2%, and 86.5%. At 33 cm without NS, decreasing the brightness from 100% to 0% decreased intensity by 99.5%, 99.8%, and 97.8%.CONCLUSIONS: The screen protector decreased the intensity at 450 nm for every setting other than those at 0% brightness.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of streptokinase (SK) on the ultrastructure of cellular elements in the cerebral cortex of newborn rats in vitro. Three series of cell cultures grown on DMEM were used, including those grown on the medium enriched with 15% fetal calf serum (control 1), cultures transferred to the depleted medium containing only 0.5% of this serum (control 2), and the experimental cultures, to which SK (2000 IU/ml) was added. Addition of SK to the medium prevented a reduction of the viability of mature (14 days) dissociated neocortical cell culture from 1-2-day-old rats, induced by a transfer of the culture to a blood serum protein-deficient medium. In a 7-day culture SK potentiated the decrease in the cell viability. In organotypical cultures, with the use of electron microscopy, it was found that SK in concentration used prevented the development of destructive changes in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons of explants, induced by a deficit in serum proteins. The neurons contained numerous mitochondria, some of which had only a few cristae. Signs of destruction were observed only in neuronal nuclei. After exposure to SK for 48 hours an activation of oligodendrocytes (containing numerous myelin bodies) was noted which was accompanied by astrocyte disintegration (with hyperchromatic nuclei in the remaining cells).

3248,"Effect of dehydration on thermoregulation in eland and hartebeest. Thermoregulatory responses to solar radiation in the eland and hartebeest were examined in the natural radiative environment by determining the relationships of sweating and panting to skin and rectal temperatures. For the hydrated eland, the thermoregulatory mechanisms of panting and sweating were related to skin and not to rectal temperature, the onset occurring at a threshold skin temperature of 31.2-31.3degreeC, respectively. When dehydrated, panting and sweating were delayed until threshold skin temperature of 35.1 and 35.7 respectively, and both were now also related to a rising rectal temperature. In the hartebeest, panting is the only regulated thermoregulatory mechanism. When fully hydrated, panting frequency of the hartebeest was related to skin temperature, the onset occurring at 33.4degreeC. However, when dehydrated, regulation of panting shifted to a rising rectal temperature, the onset of polypnea occurring at a threshold rectal temperature of 39.5degreeC. During dehydration, the sensitivity and magnitude of the panting frequency in both species were enhanced. It is postulated that peripheral thermal sensitivity in these African antelopes when hydrated helps maintain thermal homeostasis in response to increase in the radiative load. When dehydrated, rigid thermal homeostasis is abandoned to conserve water with a resultant hyperthermia. However, in both species, it is suggested that the brain is protected from hyperthermia by an enhanced sensitivity of the panting mechanism.",Excluded

The Morris water maze learning and the LTP in the CA1 area of the hippocampal slice were observed in wild-type mice and mutant mice lacking D-amino-acid oxidase. The mutant mice showed significantly shorter platform search times in the water maze and significantly larger hippocampal LTPs than the wild-type mice.

2322,"The analgesic effect of low dose focal irradiation in a mouse model of bone cancer is associated with spinal changes in neuro-mediators of nociception. Despite the widespread use of radiotherapy to treat painful bone metastases, the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of low dose ionizing radiation is unknown. Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded

The regulated expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) genes was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 29 noninstitutionalized Down syndrome individuals and compared to that of 32 normal donors. Culture conditions were chosen that measure the transient, phytohemagglutinin-induced expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA, as well as the intactness of post-transcriptional and suppressor T cell-dependent mechanisms that control this expression. The latter was achieved by analyzing, respectively, the superinduction of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA occurring upon culture with cycloheximide or after low-dose gamma-irradiation. A convenient, sensitive, and quantitative assay for specific mRNA was devised, suitable for measuring mRNA levels expressed in cells from 1 ml of peripheral blood. Analysis of individuals with Down syndrome revealed a pronounced decrease in inducibility of the IL-2 gene. By contrast, induction of IFN-gamma mRNA was as vigorous as that observed for normal donors. In cells from trisomic subjects, superinduction of IFN-gamma mRNA by cycloheximide was at least as extensive as for normal donors, while in the case of IL-2 mRNA, it was weaker. These abnormal patterns of IL-2 gene expression were seen irrespective of age. Our findings demonstrate a selective impairment of IL-2 gene expression in Down syndrome, rather than a general deficiency in helper T cells.",Excluded

This study investigated safety and efficacy associated with check-point inhibitors (CPIs) concurrent with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in melanoma patients with brain metastases. Materials/Methods: Prospectively collected data were analyzed from an IRB-approved registry of 428 patients with 2830 brain metastases treated with SRS from 2012-2015. Melanoma patients treated with SRS within 1 month of administration of a CPI were identified as being treated concurrently. Patients treated concurrently were matched 1:1 with a control group of melanoma patients treated with SRS alone. All patients had preand post-SRS T1-and T2-weighted MRIs. Categorical variables were compared with Fisher's exact tests, continuous variables with independent sample t-tests, and the log-rank test was used for survival and disease control analyses. Statistical tests were two-tailed, with the significance level set at a<0.05. Result(s): Twenty one melanoma patients with 104 brain metastases were treated concurrently with GKRS and a CPI. Ten patients were treated with Ipilimumab, ten with Pembrolizumab, and one with Nivolumab. Matched patients had no statistically significant differences in age, gender, performance status, extracranial disease burden, prior radiation, peri-SRS steroid use, number of brain lesions or total brain tumor volume treated. Patients treated with concurrent CPIs and SRS were significantly more likely to have any post-treatment increases in T1 post-contrast and T2-FLAIR volumes (52 vs 19%; P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in rates of adverse radiation effects, steroid use at follow-up, or decompressive craniotomies.

The benefit of multimodality therapy is clearly established for adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, but its impact on toxicity is not well defined. We reviewed data from prospective randomized trials to better define the risks of multimodality therapy. The rates of surgical mortality and complications range from 0% to 10% and 23% to 49%, respectively. Multimodality therapy increases acute toxicity. The rate of severe acute hematologic toxicity varies considerably between trials (3%-78%) and appears to be primarily attributable to chemotherapy. Common severe acute nonhematologic toxicities include esophagitis (16%-63%), infection (2%-30%), pain (3%-24%), and gastrointestinal (6%-60%) and cardiac (3%-19%) events. The individual contribution of each modality to nonhematologic toxicities is unclear, but toxicity is increased when adding radiosensitizing chemotherapy to radiotherapy.

2755,"Targeted disruption of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disease caused by germline biallelic mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) that results in partial or complete loss of ATM expression or activity. A diverse phenotype of the disease includes progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, radiation hypersensitivity, increased cancer incidence, immunodeficiency and chromosomal instability. The frequency of A-T in the United States and United Kingdom has been estimated to be 1:40 000. Heterozygous carriers may also have predisposition to diverse cancers. Although ATM-deficient mice have been produced, none reflects the extent of neurological abnormalities involving the loss of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum seen in patients. Hence, miniature pigs, which are anatomically and physiologically closer to humans, might serve as an alternative model for human A-T. In the present study, we attempted a targeted disruption of ATM in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Most A-T patients possess mutated ATM with truncation, resulting in prematurely terminated ATM proteins that are highly unstable. To induce the truncation of ATM, we disrupted exon 59 region of ATM that has been known to be critical for ATM kinase activity. Miniature pig fetal fibroblasts were transfected with ATM-targeting vector and treated by neomycin for 2 weeks. A total of 139 colonies were screened by PCR and 3 among them were identified as homologous recombinants with monoallelic disruption of ATM (targeting efficiency=2.1%). One of the 3 colonies was chosen and used for subsequent nuclear transfer. In total, 611 nuclear transfer embryos reconstructed with ATM-targeted fetal fibroblasts were transferred into 5 surrogate gilts. Two gilts became pregnant and developed to term with a total of 5 live piglets delivered. Being analysed by PCR, all piglets born were found to be ATM gene-targeted. Because conventional murine models of human A-T have provided only limited insights into therapies and pharmacological treatments, the generation of miniature pigs with disrupted ATM will allow new opportunities to more precisely understand A-T and to accelerate discovery of strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease. In addition, such animals may be utilised in studying cancer with respect to the involvement of ATM in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis.",Excluded

Introduction: Recently, as an alternative for the open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) of thoraco-lumbar fractures (TLF), percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) has evolved to minimize soft tissue injury and perioperative morbidity. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of three different methods of neurologically intact TLF treatment: OPSF, minimally invasive two-plane conventional fluoroscopy-guided (FPPSF) and navigation-guided (N-PPSF). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 137 patients underwent either OPSF (n = 50) or F-PPSF (n = 39) or N-PPSF (n = 48) for stabilization of TLF between 2014 and 2016 in two Departments (Orthopaedics and Neurosurgery). Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were evaluated on lateral thoracolumbar radiographs. As a method of clinical evaluation, the intraoperative blood loss, operation time, radiation dose, postoperative hospital stay, the postoperative scar size and perioprative complications. Result(s): There were significant differences between open and both percutaneous methods of treatment in surgical blood loss and postoperative hospital stay in favour of percutaneous and without significant difference between F-PPSF and N-PPSF. The time of the surgery was the shortest in OPSF and F-PPSF. The radiation dose was both the highest for the patient and the lowest for the operative team in N-PPSF. The length of the postoperative scar was equal for all groups. There were five infections of the operative wound and one implant loosening in OPSF group without any significant complication. Postoperative VAS decreased significantly in all groups and there was a significant difference in favour of percutaneous techniques groups at the time of discharge and after 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. There were no statistical differences in VAS. For both F-PPSF and N-PPSF ODI was significantly better 6 weeks after the surgery than for OPSF without any difference between all groups at the final follow-up. The regional sagittal Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle and anterior height of the fractured vertebra all significantly improved in each group immediately after the surgery and at the final follow-up. Conclusion(s): Both percutaneous pedicle screw fixation techniques were comparable except the radiation dose for the operative team, which was the lowest in N-PPSF group. Although all three groups showed favorable outcomes at the final follow-up, F-PPSF and N-PPSF provided earlier pain relief, better functional improvement, less perioperative complications but worse early postoperative radiological outcome in comparison with OPSF.",Excluded

908,"Evaluation of the size of optic nerve and optic nerve sheath in optic pathway glioma in neurofibromatosis type 1. Purpose-Objective. To evaluate the size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) patients with or without optic pathway glioma (OPG) with 3D-SPACE sequence in 3 tesla magnetic resonans imaging (MRI) unit. Material and methods. Sixteen NF-1 patients with OPG (group 1), and 17 NF-1 patients without OPG (group 2) were included in this prospective study. All patients received conventional contrast-material enhanced brain MRI, and 3D-SPACE sequence. The size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath was measured on routine fat-saturated T2 weighted STIR and 3D-SPACE images. Patients with optic nerve glioma were excluded from the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath analysis. Results. The average size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath measured with both MRI techniques did not show any significant difference between group 1 and group 2 (p> 0.05). The variables measured with either STIR or 3DSPACE imaging techniques were correlated with each other in both groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). Discussion and conclusions. Our study demonstrated that OPG presented in the optic pathways including optic chiasm, optic tractus, and optic radiations did not significantly effect the size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheat. 3D-SPACE sequence is an efficient sequence for evaluation of NF-1 patients.",Excluded
1328,"Radiation Induced Metabolic Alterations Associate With Tumor Aggressiveness and Poor Outcome in Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with a 1-year median survival, despite best available treatment, including radiotherapy (RT). Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD<sup>+</sup>, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.",Excluded

The effect of low-power gallium aluminium arsenide diode laser irradiation on the development of synapses was studied in the radiatum layer and the lacunosum-molecular layer of field CA3 of the neonatal rat hippocampus. Neonatal rats were irradiated with a low-power diode laser (830 nm, 60 mW) at two points located above the hippocampi, for 15 s, respectively, twice per day from birth (day 1) to day 5. The mean body weights of the laser-irradiated animals were found to be lower than those of the control animals, the deficit at day 20 being 22.6%. Moreover, the density of synaptic junctions stained by ethanolic phosphotungstic acid per unit area of the radiatum layer and the lacunosum-molecular layer of the neonatal rat hippocampus was significantly reduced at day 20. It was suggested that the low-power diode laser irradiation affected the development of synapses in the neonatal rat brain.",Excluded
3588,"Quantitative characterization of nuclear overhauser enhancement and amide proton transfer effects in the human brain at 7 tesla. PURPOSE: This study aimed to quantitatively investigate two main magnetization transfer effects at low B1: the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) and amide proton transfer in the human brain at 7 T.METHODS: The magnetization transfer effects in the human brain were characterized using a four-pool proton model, which consisted of bulk water, macromolecules, an amide group of mobile proteins and peptides, and NOE-related protons resonating upfield. The pool sizes, exchange rates, and relaxation times of these proton pools were investigated quantitatively by fitting, and the net signals of amide proton transfer and NOE were simulated based on the fitted parameters.RESULTS: The results showed that the four-pool model fitted the experimental data quite well, and the NOE effects in human brain at 7 T had a broad spectrum distribution. The NOE effects peaked at a B1 of ~ 1-1.4 muT and were significantly stronger in the white matter than in the gray matter, corresponding to a pool-size ratio ~ 2:1. As the amide proton transfer effect was relatively small compared with the NOE effects, magnetization transfer asymmetry analysis yielded an NOE-dominated contrast in the healthy human brain in this range of B1.CONCLUSION: These findings are important to identify the source of NOE effects and to quantify amide proton transfer effects in human brain at 7 T.",Excluded
3243,"Electrophysiological characterisation of the infrared organ of the Australian ""Little Ash Beetle"" Acanthocnemus nigricans (Coleoptera, Acanthocnemidae). This study characterises the response properties of the sensilla located on the prothoracic disc organ of the beetle Acanthocnemus nigricans, such as intensity response functions and temporal coding properties. Warming the sensilla by a red laser accelerated their ongoing spiking activity, cessation of the stimulus suppressed their firing as revealed by extracellular recordings. Convective heat sources also increased sensillum activity, but stimuli of other modalities failed to elicit responses. The response threshold was between 11 and 25 mW/cm2 and latencies ranged between 20 and 40 ms. Repeating stimuli with frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz were reliably resolved by the sensilla. This temporal resolution enables the disc sensilla to represent behaviourally relevant changes in heat stimuli in a thermally patchy environment. These findings complement our knowledge on the sensory physiology of pyrophilous insects by hinting at two different, elementary orientation strategies evolved in the three pyrophilous beetle species described. A. nigricans seems to be best adapted to short-range orientation on freshly burnt areas.",Excluded
805,"Exposure to different wavelengths of light and the development of structural and functional asymmetries in the chicken. The thalamofugal visual projections of the chick are known to develop in response to stimulation by light prior to hatching, and asymmetry in the number of projections develops as a consequence of the embryo being oriented in the egg so that it occuludes its left eye. The right eye only is stimulated by light and this causes the visual projections connected to the right eye to develop in advance of those connected to the left. We have now found that exposure of embryos, from day 19 of incubation to hatching, to red (peak transmission at 670 nm) or green (peak at 500 nm) light is as effective as broad-spectrum (white) light in establishing asymmetry in these projections. The intensities of the light to which the embryos were exposed in each case were equivalent, achieved in part by removing the air sac end of the egg shell. The thalamofugal visual projections, therefore, develop in response to light stimulation but appear to have no wavelength specificity. This result is consistent with the apparent lack of involvement of the thalamofugal visual pathway in colour vision. However, functional asymmetry, tested as left-right eye differences in categorising grain from pebbles, was found to be less marked in the chicks that had been exposed to green light compared to those that had been exposed to 'while' light, and it was absent in those exposed to red light or incubated in the dark. Thus, there is wavelength specificity for the development of the behavioural asymmetry, which suggests involvement of colour-coded neurons outside the thalamofugal visual pathway, probably in the tectofugal pathway. Exposure of the embryos to red and green light alternating at 30 min intervals is as effective as ""white' light for establishing both the structural and functional asymmetry.",Excluded
794,"Synchrotron-based in vivo tracking of implanted mammalian cells. We have developed an X-ray imaging protocol that permits 3D visualisation of a small number of implanted cells within bulk tissue. The cells are marked using natural endocytosis of inert gold nano-particles. The resulting local increase in electron density allows high imaging contrast to be obtained from small clusters of these marked cells. Using this technique we have imaged C6 glioma cells within the brain of a model animal. The cells were marked by exposing them to colloidal gold incorporated in the growth media. Gold-loaded glioma cells were implanted into the brains of adult male Wistar rats. After tumours had been allowed to develop for up to 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and images of the intact cranium were acquired at the SYRMEP imaging station on the Elettra synchrotron in Italy. Computed tomography was performed using mixed absorption and phase contrast techniques at an X-ray energy of 24 keV. In the resulting volume datasets the tumour bulk is clearly visible and the infiltrating nature of the malignant growth is well demonstrated. Although the protocol was developed using this particular model of malignant brain tumour, it is believed that it will be possible to use it with other cell lines. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1717,"Adaptive spatio-temporal filtering of multichannel surface EMG signals. A motor unit (MU) is defined as an anterior horn cell, its axon, and the muscle fibres innervated by the motor neuron. A surface electromyogram (EMG) is a superposition of many different MU action potentials (MUAPs) generated by active MUs. The objectives of this study were to introduce a new adaptive spatio-temporal filter, here called maximum kurtosis filter (MKF), and to compare it with existing filters, on its performance to detect a single MUAP train from multichannel surface EMG signals. The MKF adaptively chooses the filter coefficients by maximising the kurtosis of the output. The proposed method was compared with five commonly used spatial filters, the weighted low-pass differential filter (WLPD) and the marginal distribution of a continuous wavelet transform. The performance was evaluated using simulated EMG signals. In addition, results from a multichannel surface EMG measurement fro from a subject who had been previously exposed to radiation due to cancer were used to demonstrate an application of the method. With five time lags of the MKF, the sensitivity was 98.7% and the highest sensitivity of the traditional filters was 86.8%, which was obtained with the WLPD. The positive predictivities of these filters were 87.4 and 80.4%, respectively. Results from simulations showed that the proposed spatio-temporal filtration technique significantly improved performance as compared with existing filters, and the sensitivity and the positive predictivity increased with an increase in number of time lags in the filter. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2006.",Excluded
10,"Pre-operative versus post-operative radiosurgery of brain metastases-Volumetric and dosimetric impact of treatment sequence and margin concept. Background: Pre-operative radiosurgery (SRS) preceding the resection of brain metastases promises to circumvent limitations of post-operative cavity SRS. It minimizes uncertainties regarding delineation and safety margins and could reduce dose exposure of the healthy brain (HB). Method(s): We performed a systematic treatment plan comparison on 24 patients who received post-operative radiosurgery of the resection cavity at our institution. Comparative treatment plans were calculated for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (7 x 5 Gray (Gy)) in a hypothetical pre-operative (pre-op) and two post-operative scenarios, either with (extended field, post-op-E) or without the surgical tract (involved field, post-op-I). Detailed volumetric comparison of the resulting target volumes was performed, as well as dosimetric comparison focusing on targets and the HB. Result(s): The resection cavity was significantly smaller and different in morphology from the pre-operative lesion, yielding a low Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 53% (p = 0.019). Post-op-I and post-op-E targets showed high similarity (DSC = 93%), and including the surgical tract moderately enlarged resulting median target size (18.58 ccm vs. 22.89 ccm, p < 0.001). Dosimetric analysis favored the pre-operative treatment setting since it significantly decreased relevant dose exposure of the HB (Median volume receiving 28 Gy: 6.79 vs. 10.79 for pre-op vs. post-op-E, p < 0.001). Dosimetrically, pre-operative SRS is a promising alternative to post-operative cavity irradiation that could furthermore offer practical benefits regarding delineation and treatment planning. Comparative trials are required to evaluate potential clinical advantages of this approach. Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
405,"Predictors of individual tumor local control after stereotactic radiosurgery for non-small cell lung cancer brain metastases. Purpose: To evaluate local control rates and predictors of individual tumor local control for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Methods and Materials: Between June 1998 and May 2011, 401 brain metastases in 228 patients were treated with Gamma Knife single-fraction SRS. Local failure was defined as an increase in lesion size after SRS. Local control was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify an optimal cutpoint for conformality index relative to local control. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Median age was 60 years (range, 27-84 years). There were 66 cerebellar metastases (16%) and 335 supratentorial metastases (84%). The median prescription dose was 20 Gy (range, 14-24 Gy). Median overall survival from time of SRS was 12.1 months. The estimated local control at 12 months was 74%. On multivariate analysis, cerebellar location (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, P=.009), larger tumor volume (HR 1.09, P<.001), and lower conformality (HR 0.700, P=.044) were significant independent predictors of local failure. Conformality index cutpoints of 1.4-1.9 were predictive of local control, whereas a cutpoint of 1.75 was the most predictive (P=.001). The adjusted Kaplan-Meier 1-year local control for conformality index >=1.75 was 84% versus 69% for conformality index <1.75, controlling for tumor volume and location. The 1-year adjusted local control for cerebellar lesions was 60%, compared with 77% for supratentorial lesions, controlling for tumor volume and conformality index. Conclusions: Cerebellar tumor location, lower conformality index, and larger tumor volume were significant independent predictors of local failure after SRS for brain metastases from NSCLC. These results warrant further investigation in a prospective setting. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
848,"Ultra light-sensitive and fast neuronal activation with the Ca2+-permeable channelrhodopsin CatCh. The light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has rapidly become an important tool in neuroscience, and its use is being considered in therapeutic interventions. Although wild-type and known variant ChR2s are able to drive light-activated spike trains, their use in potential clinical applications is limited by either low light sensitivity or slow channel kinetics. We present a new variant, calcium translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh), which mediates an accelerated response time and a voltage response that is ~70-fold more light sensitive than that of wild-type ChR2. CatCh's superior properties stem from its enhanced Ca2(+) permeability. An increase in [Ca2(+)](i) elevates the internal surface potential, facilitating activation of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and indirectly increasing light sensitivity. Repolarization following light-stimulation is markedly accelerated by Ca2(+)-dependent BK channel activation. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown principle: shifting permeability from monovalent to divalent cations to increase sensitivity without compromising fast kinetics of neuronal activation. This paves the way for clinical use of light-gated channels.",Excluded
1902,"Effects of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields on acetylcholine release in hippocampus of freely moving rats. Some central cholinergic effects have been reported in animals after acute exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic field at low intensity. We studied acetylcholine (ACh) release in the brain of freely moving rats exposed for 1 h during the day to a 2.45 GHz continuous wave radiofrequency field (RF) (2 or 4 mW/cm(2)) or exposed for 1 or 14 h during the night to a 800 MHz field modulated at 32 Hz (AM 200 mW/cm(2)). Measurements were performed by microdialysis using a membrane implanted through the upper CA1 region of the hippocampus. After irradiation with the 2.45 GHz RF, rats exposed at 2 mW/cm(2) did not show a significant modification of Ach release, whereas those exposed at 4 mW/cm(2) showed a significant 40% decrease in mean ACh release from hippocampus. This decrease was maximal at 5 h post exposure. Exposure to the 800 MHz RF for 1 h did not cause any significant effect, but exposure for 14 hrs induced a significant 43% decrease in ACh release during the period 11 p.m.-4 a.m. compared to control rats. In the control group we observed an increase of ACh release at the beginning of the night, which was linked to the waking period of rats. This normal increase was disturbed in rats exposed overnight to the 800 MHz RF.

3041,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant glioblastomas demonstrate a decreased rate of pseudoprogression: A multi-institutional experience. Background: Pseudoprogression (psPD) represents false radiologic evidence of tumor progression and is observed in some glioblastoma (GBM) patients after postoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with temozolomide (TMZ). The ambiguity of the psPD diagnosis confounds identification of true progression and may lead to unnecessary interventions. The association between psPD and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational (mut) status is understudied, and its incidence may alter clinical decision making. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 120 patients with IDH1-mut (n = 60) and IDH1-wild-type (IDH-WT; [n = 60]) GBMs who received postoperative CRT with TMZ at 4 academic institutions. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to identify psPD rates in routine brain MRIs performed up to 90 days after CRT completion. Result(s): Within 90 days of completing CRT, 9 GBM patients (1 [1.7%] IDH1-mut and 8 [13.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated true progression, whereas 17 patients (3 [5%] IDH1-muts and 14 [23.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated psPD (P =. 004). IDH1-mut GBMs had a lower probability of psPD (hazard ratio: 0.173, 95% CI, 0.047-0.638, P =. 008). Among the patients with radiologic signs suggestive of progression (n = 26), psPD was found to be the cause in 3 of 4 (75.0%) of the IDH1-mut GBMs and 14 of 22 (63.6%) of the IDH1-WT GBMs (P =. 496). Median overall survival for IDH1-mut and IDH1-WT GBM patients was 40.3 and 23.0 months, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion(s): IDH1-mut GBM patients demonstrate lower absolute rates of psPD expression. Irrespective of GBM subtype, psPD expression was more likely than true progression within 90 days of completing CRT. Continuing adjuvant treatment for IDH1-mut GBMs is suggested if radiologic progression is suspected during this time interval. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

INTRODUCTION: CT-angiography gains an increasing role in the initial diagnosis of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the implementation of CT-angiography does not always exclude the necessity of conventional angiography. Our objective was to determine the practical utility and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography.METHODS: All patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to our university hospital after implementation of CT-angiography between June 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in regard to factors of treatment flow, radiation exposure, harms of contrast medium loading, and diagnostic costs. A control group of the same size was assembled from previously admitted SAH patients, who did not undergo pretreatment CT-angiography. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.RESULTS: The final analysis consisted of 93 patients in each group. Of 93 patients with pretreatment CT-angiography, 74 had to undergo conventional angiography for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. CT-angiography had significant impact on the reduction of collective effective radiation dose by 4.419 mSv per person (p = 0.0002) and was not associated with additional harms. Despite the significantly earlier detection of aneurysms with CT-angiography (p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in the timing of aneurysm repair and duration of ICU and general hospital stay. There was an increase of diagnostic costs-the cost-effectiveness analysis showed, however, that benefits of CT-angiography in respect to radiation exposure and risk of conventional angiography-related complications justify the additional costs of CT-angiography.CONCLUSIONS: Although the implementation of CT-angiography in SAH diagnosis cannot completely replace conventional angiography, it can be approved in regard to radiation hygiene and cost-effectiveness.",Excluded
3171,"Successful endoscopic hemostasis with cryotherapy for a case of refractory esophageal cancer bleeding. Gastrointestinal malignancy bleeding (GIMB) can be a clinical challenge. Options for treatment include surgical resection, radiation, angiography with embolization and endoscopic treatment (ET). Currently there is no standard of care for ET of GIMB. Modalities tried in the past include epinephrine injection, contact thermal devices, argon plasma coagulation (APC) and hemoclip (HC) placement. Cryotherapy (cryo) is a modality used for tumor ablation. It has also been successfully used in treatment of benign bleeding such as radiation proctitis and gastric antral vascular ectasia. There is one case report of cryo use in refractory GIMB leading to short term hemostasis (HS). We present a case of long term HS achieved by cryo in a patient with refractory GIMB. A 51 year old male with a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presented with melena. He was successfully treated with APC and was then referred for external beam radiation to prevent further bleeding. This combination achieved HS for around 8 months after which he presented with recurrent melena. A second attempt at treatment with APC achieved initial hemostasis but bleeding recurred 2 days later. Cryo was offered to him to aid with his dysphagia and possibly hemostasis. On EGD a fungating tumor oozing blood was seen in the distal third of the esophagus. Cryo was performed with 15 second freeze cycles. The patient experienced significant improvement in his dysphagia and resolution of his melena. The patient expired 2 months later due to newly diagnosed brain metastasis without recurrence of his melena. ET of GIMB continues to be a challenge. Multiple modalities can be tried including standard hemostatic maneuvers. Bleeding often recurs and can become refractory. Hemospray has been reported to be effective in these situations but is not available in the United States. Cryo, proven effective in refractory benign bleeding and approved for tumor ablation was used successfully in this patient. Cryo effect at standard application duration is limited to the superficial 5 mm of tissue. In addition to tumor necrosis has the theoretical advantage of forming crystal in the microvasculature leading to thrombosis and possibly hemostasis. This is a case of long term hemostasis achieved by cryotherapy in a patient with refractory tumor bleeding. A prospective study is needed to determine whether these effects can be reproduced in other patients. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1612,"Normal tissue contour variation and the dosimetric impact on radiation therapy treatment planning. Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate how variability in contouring normal tissues affects dose assessment for radiation therapy treatment planning. Materials/Methods: Computed tomography (CT) scans of individual patients treated for tumors of the brain, head and neck, thorax, pancreas and prostate were selected for this study. For each scan, a radiation oncologist, who primarily treats the disease site and a diagnostic radiologist, outlined the normal tissues (""gold"" contours) using RTOG guidelines. A total of 27 organs were delineated. Independently, five board-certified dosimetrists and one trainee then outlined the same set of contours on the individual scans. A radiation treatment plan was calculated for each of the disease sites based on PTVs, gold contours and doses defined by the physician. Dose-volume constraints were defined per RTOG protocol criteria for each disease site. Result(s): For the 27 gold organs contoured, a total of 156 organs were outlined by dosimetrists. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for each dosimetrist drawn organ and compared with the gold contours. Of the 34 dosimetric endpoints that were evaluated, 56% of the organs had dosimetric parameters that agreed to within 10% of those obtained by the gold contours. Maximum and mean dose variation for the dosimetrist's contours that were greater than 10% when compared to the dose of the gold contours were reviewed. Organs with the highest variation in dose were the optic lens maximum dose (45%) and the mandible maximum dose (40%). Moderate variation was seen for the mean left parotid gland dose (15%) and the cervical spinal cord (13%). When evaluating the prostate plan, the V80Gy, V75Gy and V65Gy for the bladder and the V70Gy and V50Gy for the rectum were obtained. Minimal variation was observed in the absolute volumes at each dose level, however the relative variation was larger (10-25%). This difference is due to the small volume of the organs receiving these doses and was determined not to be clinically relevant. Conclusion(s): The results of this study demonstrated that the normal tissue contours produced by our dosimetrists showed good dosimetric agreement with the gold contours for over half of the organs evaluated. For the remaining organs, our expectation is that the establishment of contouring competencies will ensure more accurate treatments and dose assessment in radiotherapy treatment planning and delivery.",Excluded

3519,"Bridging Radiation Therapy Before Commercial Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma. Purpose: CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma (r/rABL), culminating in 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies: tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel). Following leukapheresis and in preparation for CART infusion, contemporary bridging and lymphodepletion regimens rely mostly on cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, in a cohort of patients treated with commercial tisa-cel and axi-cel, we show that bridging-RT may offer a supplemental approach. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients receiving commercial tisa-cel (n = 13) or axi-cel (n = 18) between August 2018 and February 2019 for r/rABL were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: (1) bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion or (2) nonbridging-RT (NBRT), in which patients received either remote RT greater than 30 days before CART infusion or no prior RT. Result(s): Five patients received bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion. Median bridging-RT dose was 37.5 Gy and was completed a median of 13 days before infusion. No grade 3 (G3) or higher RT-toxicities occurred. No patients in the bridging-RT group experienced G3 or higher CART-related toxicities (CRS or neurotoxicity), and 23% (n = 6) and 15% (n = 4) experienced G3-5 CRS and G3-5 neurotoxicity in the NBRT group, respectively. Overall treatment response in the bridging-RT and NBRT groups was 80% and 64%, respectively. The axi-cel CART product was associated with CRS (odds ratio [OR] = 26.67, P =.001) and CRS correlated with neurotoxicity (OR = 12.22, P =.028). There was a trend toward an association for CRS with metabolic tumor volume (OR = 1.06/mL, P =.141) and TLG (OR = 1.01/mL x standard uptake value, P =.099). Conclusion(s): Bridging-RT before commercial CART does not appear to increase the risk for CART-related toxicities or negatively affect outcomes in r/rABL patients. No G3 or higher RT-toxicities occurred in this series. Pretreatment metabolic tumor burden may be associated with CART-associated CRS; however, larger patient numbers are required to elucidate significant associations.

1337,"Subthalamic Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Parkinson's Disease: A Cautionary Tale. INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reliably improve several symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in appropriately selected patients. Various factors may preclude patients from undergoing DBS and for them, non-invasive lesion-based therapies such as focused ultrasound and Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery may present a safer alternative.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on preliminary positive reports of STN GK for PD, we conducted a prospective, open-label, single-center, pilot study in PD patients deemed potential candidates for unilateral DBS based on their disease characteristics, but contraindicated due to age >74, an irreversible bleeding diathesis, or significant comorbid medical disease. Stereotactic MRI-guided GK radiosurgery was performed using a single 110- or 120-Gy dose targeting the STN contralateral to the more symptomatic extremity. Clinical follow-up and imaging assessed the safety and efficacy of the procedure over a 12-month period.RESULTS: Four PD patients with medication-refractory tremors and disabling dyskinesias underwent unilateral STN GK radiosurgery. Contraindications to DBS included high-risk comorbid cardiovas-cular disease in 3 patients and an irreversible bleeding diathesis in 1. There were no immediate post-procedural adverse events. One patient who underwent left STN GK radiosurgery developed right hemiparesis and dysarthria 7 months post-procedure followed by hospitalization at 9 months for bacterial endocarditis and liver failure from which he died. The remaining 3 patients were free of adverse events up to 12 months post-procedure and experienced a reduction in contralateral rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. Upon extended follow-up, 2 patients developed subacute worsening of gait. One died at 16 months due to complications of a fall whereas the other saw no change in gait up to 42 months post-procedure. All 3 patients with adverse events demonstrated a hyper-response in the targeted area on follow-up neuroimaging.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite the potential for clinical improvement, our results suggest that unilateral STN GK radiosurgery should be approached cautiously in medically frail PD patients who may be at higher risk of GK hyper-response and neurologic complications.",Excluded
1845,"Dti imaging of white matter changes in normal pressure hydrocephalus patients. PURPOSE The etiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) remains enigmatic. The search for reliable markers of the disease that could be used for non invasive diagnostics is constantly needed. One of the hypotheses for gait impairment in NPH is the affection of periventricular white matter. METHODS In this study 15 patients were investigated for possible NPH. All patients underwent diagnostic testing (lumbar infusion test and 5 days of external lumbar drainage for diagnosis of NPH). Only the patients with positive diagnostic response were included in the study (n=10), all patients with postive response were finally treated by venriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients underwent MRI examination including T2W, T1W and DTI sequence of the whole brain in axial sections (EPI, TR/TE=12,000/ 89.4 ms, 40 slices with thickness of 2,4 mm, no gap, 128x 128 matrix, FOV 24x24 cm2; along 30 noncollinear gradient directions with b value of 1000 s/mm2, with additional five b=0 images). Anatomical 3D T1W sequence was also acquired. Twenty age matched subjects with Alzheimer disease resulting in marked atrophia and venricular dilatation, without clinical signs of NPH were examined with the same technique. Following parameters were then manually measured: fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in fornix, splenium of corpus callosum, genu of the internal capsule, and optic radiation. The ROIs were placed two slices above the slice where anterior comissure could be detected. A Mann Whitney U test was used for the analysis of the results. Tract based spatial statistics method (TBSS) was also used. RESULTS The fractional anisotropy was decreased significantly in the NPH patient group compared to the controls (p<0,01) in fornix, right genu of the capsula interna and left optical radiation (p< 0,05), the data showed some trend (p<0,1) in ADC of the left and right optical radiation. The results were similar using TBSS. CONCLUSION The DTI measurements may reveal the white matter structural imparirment in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. As a possible non-invasive diagnostic marker it deserves further attention and investigation.",Excluded

The aims of this study were to investigate: 1) whether G history influences latent time to, or sequence of, symptoms/signs upon G exposures exceeding the tolerance threshold; and 2) how pilots respond to a sudden loss of pressure in the anti-G garment (AGG) in flight-like scenarios. Method(s): There were 14 subjects who were exposed to rapid onset rate 1 G<inf>z</inf> -time profiles, with plateaus 1 and 2 G above the relaxed tolerance level, without initial pressurization of the AGG (NoAGG) and when losing AGG pressure after 10 (AGG_10) and 120 (AGG_120) s at the plateau. Simulated target-chase flights during which AGG pressure was released were performed by seven pilots; the pilot was instructed to behave as during real flight. Result(s): Latent time to symptoms was shorter at 1 2 G than at 1 1 G, and shorter in AGG_10 and AGG_120 than in NoAGG. In AGG_120, 43 and 64% of the subjects experienced serious symptoms (black out, Almost LOC, G-LOC) at 1 1 and 1 2 G, respectively, compared to 21 and 54% in AGG_10 and 7 and 29% in NoAGG. The incidence of A-LOC/ G-LOC was higher in AGG_10 and especially in AGG_120 than in NoAGG. During the target chase, one pilot did not notice the pressure loss, one experienced G-LOC, and two A-LOC. Discussion(s): The risk of serious consequences of G exposure exceeding the tolerance level appears to be greater when G-garment failure occurs after a prolonged than after a brief exposure. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",Excluded

1721,"Nontraumatic vascular emergencies: Imaging and intervention in acute occlusion. Risk factors for acute venous occlusion range from prolonged immobilization to hypercoagulability syndromes, trauma, and malignancy. The aim of this review article is to illustrate the different imaging options for the diagnosis of acute venous occlusion and to assess the value of interventional strategies for venous thrombosis treatment in an emergency setting. First, diagnosis and treatment of the most common form of venous occlusion, at the level of the lower extremities, is presented, followed by pelvic vein and inferior vena cava occlusion, mesenteric venous thrombosis, upper extremity occlusion, acute cerebral vein thrombosis, and finally acute venous occlusion of hemodialysis access. In acute venous occlusion of the lower extremity phlebography is still the reference gold standard. Presently, duplex ultrasound with manual compression is the most sensitive and specific noninvasive test. Limitations of ultrasonography include isolated distal calf vein occlusion, obesity, and patients with lower extremity edema. If sonography is non-diagnostic, venography should be considered. Magnetic resonance venography can differentiate an acute occlusion from chronic thrombus, but because of its high cost and limited availability, it is not yet used for the routine diagnosis of lower extremity venous occlusion only. Regarding interventional treatment, catheter-directed thrombolysis can be applied to dissolve thrombus in charily selected patients with symptomatic occlusion and no contraindications to therapy. Acute occlusion of the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, often due to extension from the femoropopliteal system, represents a major risk for pulmonary embolism. Color flow Doppler imaging is often limited owing to obesity and bowel gas. Venography has long been considered the gold standard for identifying proximal venous occlusion. Both CT scanning and MR imaging, however, can even more accurately diagnose acute pelvis vein or inferior vena cava occlusion. MRI is preferred because it is noninvasive, does not require contrast agent, carries no exposure to ionizing radiation, and is highly accurate and reproducible. Apart from catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy has proven to be a quick and safe treatment modality by enabling the recanalization of thrombotic occlusions in conjunction with minimal invasiveness and a low bleeding risk. Mechanical thrombectomy devices should only be used in conjunction with a temporary cava filter. Contrast-enhanced CT is at present considered the examination of choice for acute mesenteric vein occlusion which has mortality rates as high as 80%. Patients with proven acute mesenteric venous occlusion and contraindications to surgical therapy and no identified bleeding disposition without looming bowel ischemia or infarction are possible contenders to the less invasive percutaneous approach either by (in)direct thrombolysis or mechanical means. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of upper extremity thrombosis. Computed tomography and MRI are in addition helpful in diagnosing central chest vein occlusions. The interventionalist is rarely involved in the treatment of this entity. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is known to improve lysis rates. Together with balloon angioplasty good results have been obtained. If stenosis or thrombus remains after thrombolysis and angioplasty, stent placement should follow. Within the first two weeks, thrombosed dural sinus and cerebral venous vessels are typically hyperdense on CT compared with brain parenchyma; after the course of 2 weeks, the thrombus will become isodense. In MRI an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, an axial diffusion-weighted MRI, coronal T1-weighted spinecho and T2-weighted turbo-spinecho sequences, a coronal gradientecho and a 3D phase-contrast venous angiogram should be performed. Local thrombolysis is needed only when patients have an exacerbation of clinical symptoms or imaging signs of worsening disease despite sufficient anticoagulation therapy. Acute occlusions of dialysis grafts and fistulae are a frequently encountered complication. Among the various methods described for acute occlusion screening, ultrasonography and MRI have been proven to be accurate and noninvasive; however, if immediate treatment can be anticipated, imaging should be performed directly by digital subtraction angiography before the percutaneous intervention. Initial percutaneous thrombectomy is very effective with success rates and patency rates comparable to those of surgical thrombectomy. A short thrombosis can be treated with balloon angioplasty alone, whereas an extensive thrombosis requires a combination of mechanical devices and/or thrombolytic agents with adjunctive balloon angioplasty.",Excluded
438,"Resolution of the more anteriorly positioned psoas muscle following correction of spinal sagittal alignment from spondylolisthesis: Case report. Several studies have described the radiographic, histological, and morphological changes to the paraspinal muscle in patients with chronic low-back pain due to degenerative diseases of the spine. Gross anatomical illustrations have shown that the psoas muscle lies lateral to the L4-5 vertebrae and subsequently thins and dissociates from the vertebral body at L5-S1 in a ventrolateral course. A ""rising psoas"" may influence the location of the lumbar plexus and result in transient neurological injury on lateral approach to the spine. It is postulated that axial back pain may be exacerbated by anatomical changes of paraspinal musculature as a direct result of degenerative spine conditions. To their knowledge, the authors present the first reported case of a more anteriorly positioned psoas muscle and its resolution following correction of spondylolisthesis in a 62-year-old woman. This case highlights the dynamic nature of degenerative spinal disorders and illustrates that psoas muscle position can be affected by sagittal balance.

1070,"Central pain modulation after subthalamic nucleus stimulation: A crossover randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute effect of subthalamic nuclei deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and levodopa on pain and tolerance thresholds in patients with Parkinson disease. We hypothesized that a modification of pain threshold after STN-DBS would suggest a central modification of pain perception, whereas the absence of pain threshold change after STN-DBS would correspond to a peripheral mechanism via a decrease of painful stimuli.METHODS: Nineteen patients with Parkinson disease were included in this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Postoperatively, we evaluated pain thresholds (thermal and mechanical) and motor symptoms under 3 acute conditions: stimulation on/medication off; stimulation off/medication on; and stimulation off/medication off. We also conducted a retrospective analysis of the data prospectively recorded during the follow-up of the cohort pre- and postoperatively (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, equivalent levodopa daily dose, and tapping test score).RESULTS: We found a significant increase of pain and tolerance mechanical thresholds not only after acute STN-DBS but also after acute levodopa administration. We did not find any significant correlation between postoperative clinical pain improvement and UPDRS-III improvement after acute levodopa or STN-DBS, nor with motor complications improvement assessed with UPDRS-IV after chronic STN-DBS. No correlation was found between postoperative clinical pain improvement and mechanical pain threshold modification.CONCLUSION: Clinical pain alleviation after STN-DBS cannot be considered merely as a consequence of motor complications improvement and could be attributable to a direct central modulation of pain perception, via increased mechanical pain and tolerance thresholds.",Excluded

Background and aims: Epicrania fugax (EF) diagnostic criteria (Appendix of International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) point out the appearance of brief pain paroxysms, describing a stable trajectory across the surface of one hemicranium, commencing and terminating in territories of different nerves. Pain radiation may be forward or backward. We aimed to analyse a large series of patients attended in an outpatient headache clinic. Method(s): We systematically included all patients fulfilling criteria from March 2008 to January 2019. We prospectively assessed clinical and demographic characteristics, therapeutic requirements and response. Result(s): We included 87 patients (61 females, 26 males) out of 5980 attended during study period (1.45%). Age at onset was 45.3+/-16.8 years (16-84). 56 cases (64.4%) suffered a forward EF, 28 (32.2%) a backward EF, and in 3 (3.4%) paroxysms described both trajectories. Pain was strictly unilateral in 72 (82.7%) patients whilst in 11 (12.6%) shifted both sides and in 4 (4.6%) presented a sagittal trajectory. Pain quality was mainly described as electric (52, 59.7%), or stabbing (27. 31%) and intensity rated as 6.9+/-1.9 (3-10). In 28 cases (32%) autonomic features appeared (mainly lacrimation). Temporal pattern was heterogeneous, with spontaneous remissions in 27 cases (31%). 54 patients (62.1%) required a preventive therapy.

3063,"Spinal epidural tumor in patients with prostate cancer: Clinical and radiographic predictors of response to radiation therapy. The authors retrospectively reviewed 50 episodes of spinal epidural tumor that occurred in 42 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and were treated with external-beam radiation. Treatment response was evaluated in terms of symptoms, neurologic status, and, in most cases, reduction of tumor on repeat myelography. At the completion of therapy, 92% of treated patients experienced pain relief and 67% had significant to complete improvement on neurologic examination. Thirty days after treatment, repeat myelography was performed in 40 of the 50 cases; compared with the initial findings immediately preceding radiation therapy (RT), the results of 58% of these studies had normalized completely, results were improved in 25%, and the results had not changed in 18%. The presence of a high-grade compression fracture of the vertebral body was an indicator of poor prognosis for tumor response on repeat myelography. The ability of a patient to walk before treatment and tumor response on repeat myelography were associated significantly with improved outcome of RT and with survival. The authors conclude that RT can effectively palliate epidural lesions from metastatic prostate cancer. The prognosis for the long-term response to therapy may be indicated by pretreatment ambulatory status and posttreatment imaging of the epidural space.",Excluded

1473,"Low-power inversion recovery MRI preserves brain tissue contrast for patients with Parkinson disease with deep brain stimulators. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequences have been very useful for MR imaging-guided deep brain stimulation procedures in Parkinson disease. However, high-quality fast spin-echo imaging deposits significant heat, exceeding FDA-approved limits when patients already have undergone deep brain stimulation and need a second one or a routine brain MR imaging for neurologic indications. We have developed a STIR sequence with an ultra-low specific absorption rate that meets hardware limitations and produces adequate tissue contrast in cortical and subcortical brain tissues for deep brain stimulation recipients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with medically refractory Parkinson disease who qualified for deep brain stimulation were imaged at 1.5T with a fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence modified to meet conditional MR imaging hardware and specific absorption rate restrictions. Tissue contrast-to-noise ratios and implant localization were objectively and subjectively compared by 2 neuroradiologists, and image quality for surgical planning was assessed by a neurosurgeon for high and low specific absorption rate images.RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio for cerebral tissues without including the contrast-to-noise ratio for ventricular fluid was 35 and 31 for high and low specific absorption rate images. Subjective ratings for low specific absorption rate tissue contrast in 77% of patients were identical to (and in a few cases higher than) those of high specific absorption rate contrast, while the neurosurgical coordinates for fusing the stereotactic atlas with low specific absorption rate MR imaging were equivalent to those of the high specific absorption rate for 69% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Parkinson disease who have already had a deep brain stimulation face a risk of neural injury if routine, high specific absorption rate MR imaging is performed. Our modified fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence conforms to very conservative radiofrequency safety limits, while it maintains high tissue contrast for presurgical planning, postsurgical assessment, and radiologic evaluations with greater confidence for radiofrequency safety.",Excluded

Background The GLARIUS trial, which investigated the efficacy of bevacizumab (BEV)/irinotecan (IRI) compared with standard temozolomide in the first-line therapy of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-nonmethylated glioblastoma, showed that progression-free survival was significantly prolonged by BEV/IRI, while overall survival was similar in both arms. The present report focuses on quality of life (QoL) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) during the whole course of the disease. Methods Patients (n = 170) received standard radiotherapy and were randomized (2:1) for BEV/IRI or standard temozolomide. At least every 3 months KPS was determined and QoL was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Core Quality of Life and 20-item Brain Neoplasm questionnaires. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model evaluated differences in the course of QoL and KPS over time. Also, the time to first deterioration and the time to postprogression deterioration were analyzed separately. Results In all dimensions of QoL and KPS, GEE analyses and time to first deterioration analyses did not detect significant differences between the treatment arms. At progression, 82% of patients receiving second-line therapy in the standard arm received BEV second-line therapy. For the dimensions of motor dysfunction and headaches, time to postprogression deterioration was prolonged in the standard arm receiving crossover second-line BEV in the vast majority of patients at the time of evaluation. Conclusions GLARIUS did not find indications for a BEV-induced detrimental effect on QoL in first-line therapy of MGMT-nonmethylated GBM patients. Moreover, GLARIUS provided some indirect corroborative data supporting the notion that BEV may have beneficial effects upon QoL in relapsed GBM. Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
655,"Patterning the cone mosaic array in zebrafish retina requires specification of ultraviolet-sensitive cones. Cone photoreceptors in teleost fish are organized in precise, crystalline arrays in the epithelial plane of the retina. In zebrafish, four distinct morphological/spectral cone types occupy specific, invariant positions within a regular lattice. The cone lattice is aligned orthogonal and parallel to circumference of the retinal hemisphere: it emerges as cones generated in a germinal zone at the retinal periphery are incorporated as single-cell columns into the cone lattice. Genetic disruption of the transcription factor Tbx2b eliminates most of the cone subtype maximally sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and also perturbs the long-range organization of the cone lattice. In the tbx2b mutant, the other three cone types (red, green, and blue cones) are specified in the correct proportion, differentiate normally, and acquire normal, planar polarized adhesive interactions mediated by Crumbs 2a and Crumbs 2b. Quantitative image analysis of cell adjacency revealed that the cones in the tbx2b mutant primarily have two nearest neighbors and align in single-cell-wide column fragments that are separated by rod photoreceptors. Some UV cones differentiate at the dorsal retinal margin in the tbx2b mutant, although they are severely dysmorphic and are eventually eliminated. Incorporating loss of UV cones during formation of cone columns at the margin into our previously published mathematical model of zebrafish cone mosaic formation (which uses bidirectional interactions between planar cell polarity proteins and anisotropic mechanical stresses in the plane of the retinal epithelium to generate regular columns of cones parallel to the margin) reproduces many features of the pattern disruptions seen in the tbx2b mutant.",Excluded

Systemic chemotherapy is the bedrock of treatment for both the limited and extensive stages of the disease. However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC.

733,"Evidence for a basal temporal visual language center: cortical stimulation producing pure alexia. BACKGROUND: Dejerine and Benson and Geschwind postulated disconnection of the dominant angular gyrus from both visual association cortices as the basis for pure alexia, emphasizing disruption of white matter tracts in the dominant temporooccipital region. Recently functional imaging studies provide evidence for direct participation of basal temporal and occipital cortices in the cognitive process of reading. The exact location and function of these areas remain a matter of debate.OBJECTIVE: To confirm the participation of the basal temporal region in reading.METHOD: Extraoperative electrical stimulation of the dominant hemisphere was performed in three subjects using subdural electrodes, as part of presurgical evaluation for refractory epilepsy.RESULTS: Pure alexia was reproduced during cortical stimulation of the dominant posterior fusiform and inferior temporal gyri in all three patients. Stimulation resulted in selective reading difficulty with intact auditory comprehension and writing. Reading difficulty involved sentences and words with intact letter by letter reading. Picture naming difficulties were also noted at some electrodes. This region is located posterior to and contiguous with the basal temporal language area (BTLA) where stimulation resulted in global language dysfunction in visual and auditory realms. The location corresponded with the visual word form area described on functional MRI.CONCLUSION: These observations support the existence of a visual language area in the dominant fusiform and occipitotemporal gyri, contiguous with basal temporal language area. A portion of visual language area was exclusively involved in lexical processing while the other part of this region processed both lexical and nonlexical symbols.",Excluded
3258,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded

2523,"Comet assay as a useful tool to assess brain damage. DNA damage could be defined as any modification of DNA that changes its coding properties. There are two main mechanisms inducing damage to the structure of DNA: (1) spontaneous damage caused by sources within a cell and (2) damage caused by external sources such as chemicals and radiation. Protracted oxidative, hydrolytic, deamination or alkylation reactions can modify DNA bases, or even sometimes cause a complete loss of bases within DNA, resulting in strand breakage. In the same way, cellular DNA can be damaged by external sources such as ultraviolet or ionizing radiation and a variety of chemical substances can induce interstrand and intrastrand cross-links, DNA-protein cross-links, bulky DNA adducts, single strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs). The human genome is constantly exposed to many classes of genotoxins and the central nervous system is sensitive to oxidative damage. Deficiency in repair of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. DNA damage measurement in any cell or tissue is a significant indicator of a stable or unstable nature of the genomic apparatus, which would reveal physiological health status of a single cell and a whole organism. A number of techniques to detect DNA damage have been used to identify substances with genotoxic activity. The most useful approach to assess DNA damage seems to be the single-cell gel (SCG) or also named Comet assay. This is a simple, rapid, and sensitive technique for the analysis of DNA damage in all cell types, which combine DNA gel electrophoresis with fluorescence microscopy to visualize the migration of DNA strands from individual agarose-embedded cells. Determination of the relative amount of DNA that migrates provided an easy way to evaluate the number of DNA breaks in an individual cell. Since its development in 1984, the Comet assay has been modified at various steps to make it suitable for assessing various kinds of damage in different cells. It is now a tool used extensively to assess DNA damage and repair. Since the introduction of the Alkaline Comet assay, in 1988, the extent of applications and the number of investigators using this technique have increased almost exponentially. This assay has developed into a vital tool for use by investigators interested in research areas ranging from human and environmental biomonitoring to DNA repair processes and genetic toxicology. The Comet assay has been used as a test to predict the risk of development of some diseases related to a higher susceptibility of the individual to DNA damage.

Magnetic resonance imaging-only radiotherapy treatment planning (MRI-only RTP) and positron emission tomography (PET)-MRI imaging require generation of synthetic computed tomography (sCT) images from MRI images. In this study, initial dosimetric evaluation was performed for a previously developed MRI-based attenuation correction (MRAC) method for use in MRI-only RTP of the brain. MRAC-based sCT images were retrospectively generated from Dixon MR images of 20 patients who had previously received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Bone segmentation performance and Dice similarity coefficient of the sCT conversion method were evaluated for bone volumes on CT images. Dose calculation accuracy was assessed by recalculating the CT-based EBRT plans using the sCT images as the base attenuation data. Dose comparison was done for the sCTand CT-based EBRT plans in planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). Parametric dose comparison showed mean relative differences of <0.4% for PTV and <1.0% for OARs. Mean gamma index pass rates of 95.7% with the 2%/2 mm agreement criterion and 96.5% with the 1%/1 mm agreement criterion were determined for glioma and metastasis patients, respectively.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults, with a median survival for patients of 12-15 months after diagnosis. Standard therapy includes radiation and chemotherapy, with GBM recurrences refractory to second line treatments. Given the lack of therapeutic opportunities in GBM, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been shown to support GBM maintenance and exhibit enhanced resistance to ionizing radiation, a cornerstone of GBM therapy. Monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4, SLC16A3) is highly expressed in the vast majority of GBMs and predominantly in cells that congregate in ""palisades"" around centers of necrosis or in cells where hypoxiainducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is expressed either due to reduced oxygen levels or other microenvironmental stresses. MCT4 appears to regulate proliferation, survival, and xenograft implantation of GSC neurosphere lines. Importantly, we found these effects to be independent of lactate homeostasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differentially expressed genes revealed an enrichment of DNA replication stress response pathways including cell cycle (G2/M checkpoint), DNA replication, DNA damage response (DDR), and cellular deoxyribonucleotide metabolism in MCT4-depleted GSCs. To validate these data, after lentiviral silencing of MCT4 expression in two GBM neurosphere lines, we examined DNA repair potential by assessing the resolution of yH2AX and by performing alkaline comet assays. In both assays, reduced MCT4 levels resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of nuclear foci (p < 0.0001) and in the percentage of cells with comet tails (p=0.0003), respectively, confirming that reduced MCT4 expression decreases cellular ability to repair DNA damage. Moreover, we show that conditional MCT4 depletion alone (p=0.0001) or in combination with ionizing radiation (p=0.0006) efficiently enhance survival of mice orthotopi- cally implanted with GSC-derived xenografts. We determined that MCT4 inhibition enhances the radiosensitivity of GBM and should be explored as a treatment strategy to complement conventional treatment.",Excluded
975,"Location of glioblastoma intersectiing white matter tracts predict patient prognosis and response to bevacizumab prior to therapy. INTRODUCTION: Brain tumors are known to invade healthy brain along white matter tracts. We therefore hypothesized that specific white matter tracts would be associated with poorer prognosis based on their connection to primitive brain regions necessary for essential life functions. We also hypothesized that tumors in these regions treated with bevacizumab would alter patient survival. METHOD(S): 109 subjects with primary GBM tumors were retrospectively included in this study. Voxel-wise survival analyses were performed to test for spatial and treatment dependence of GBM survival prognosis. An intersection analysis was first performed between an enhancing tumor mask and template-space diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived tractography which highlighted voxels with tumor-intersecting white matter tracts. Maps of voxels with these tracts were made for each patient. A voxel-wise Kaplan-Meier test was performed comparing the survival times of patients with and without a tumor-intersecting white matter tract in that voxel. The same analysis was implemented to compare survival of participants with and without bevacizumab. This highlighted regions where survival was effected due to anti-VEGF treatment. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to validate the observed survival differences induced by bevacizumab considering inconsistencies in treatment regimens seen in the patient population. RESULT(S): Glioblastoma patients with tumors intersecting the right anterior thalamic radiation, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral corticospinal tracts, and corpus callosum have decreased survival compared to those with tumors intersecting elsewhere. Patients treated with bevacizumab and who also had tumors intersecting the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, or the thalamic radiations were found to be at a survival advantage when compared to those who did not receive bevacizumab. CONCLUSION(S): Patient prognosis is associated with the location of tumor intersecting WM tracts. A survival advantage was found in tumors intersecting specific WM tracts treated with bevacizumab.",Excluded
987,"Autopsy report of a late delayed radiation injury after a period of 45 years. For delayed radiation injury, image analysis has considerably advanced, but neuropathological findings are still required to establish diagnosis. A patient who had received radiation therapy for pineal germinoma at age 14 developed neurological and psychiatric abnormalities after 15 years as a late delayed radiation injury. Autopsy at age 59 revealed diffuse changes in the white matter consisting in order of severity of myelin pallor, demyelination, and necrosis which were characterized by a lack of glial reaction. The cerebral cortex was relatively well preserved. As delayed radiation injuries, hyalinous changes in the vascular wall, angiomatous lesions and, fresh and old petechial hemorrhages were found. Moreover, vascular changes associated with arteriosclerosis were also present. Furthermore, a focal glial nodule was detected which was considered to be a new radiation-induced neoplasia. These findings suggest that late delayed radiation injury may slowly develop over 30 years and may involve damage to neuroglial stem cell compensation. It is also evident that arteriosclerotic changes and newly induced neoplasia may develop in delayed radiation injury cases.",Excluded
2831,"Shunt age-related complications in adult patients with suspected shunt dysfunction. A recommended diagnostic workup. Background: Patients admitted for suspicion of shunt dysfunction (SD) often show unspecific symptoms and require time-consuming, expensive and even invasive diagnostics involving significant radiation exposure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the current diagnostic procedures and to propose a process optimisation. Method(s): As all patients admitted for suspicion of SD receive imaging studies, we searched for adult patients receiving neuroimaging in the period from January 2010 to July 2013, analysing referring diagnosis, clinical signs, products, diagnostic process and final diagnosis. Recursive partitioning was used to define time intervals for differentiating types of SD. Result(s): A total of 148 patients, aged 18-89 (mean, 54) years, were studied. Forty-two percent were referred by a hospital or rehabilitation centre, 30% by general practitioners and 24% were self-referrals. The admission diagnosis was in the majority ""shunt dysfunction"" only. Further differentiations were rarely made. An SD was confirmed in 46% of the patients. In 17%, the symptoms were based on another cause and in 37% they could not be clearly attributed to any specific disorder. Abdominal dislocations (2%) and shunt infections (5%) were found within the first 6 months. Over- (3%) and under-drainage (14%) were the most frequent complications during the first 4 years. Disconnections (13%) occurred generally 4 years or more after implantation. Only shunt obstruction (9%) showed no temporal pattern. Conclusion(s): Symptoms of SD remain mostly unspecific. This study showed that the type of SD depends on the time interval from implantation. We propose a workup strategy for patients with SD based on the temporal profile.

426,"Nongynecologic Findings Seen at Pelvic US. Ultrasonography (US) is frequently the first imaging modality used to examine women with symptoms involving the pelvis. It is widely available and involves no exposure to ionizing radiation. Images can be acquired with a transabdominal, endovaginal, or translabial approach, and the use of video clips and three-dimensional reconstructions can be helpful. US is excellent for assessment of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Occasionally, nongynecologic pelvic diseases arising from the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems and the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces may be detected and can be a source of diagnostic dilemma. US can be helpful not only in the detection but also occasionally in the characterization of such entities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in complicated cases. In this article, the normal US appearance of the bowel and US signs of bowel disease and specific entities, including appendicitis, diverticular disease, bowel obstruction, appendiceal mucocele, and intestinal tumors, are reviewed. The lower urinary tract is included in the field of view in every pelvic US examination; commonly encountered entities related to the urinary bladder, distal ureter, and urethra are illustrated. In addition to arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, pathologic conditions in the pelvis can arise in the peritoneal or extraperitoneal space. Although conditions of the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces are rare, it is important to recognize these entities and distinguish them from the more common gynecologic diseases. Owing to the implications for diagnosis and management, radiologists and other physicians who perform pelvic US should be aware of the spectrum of nongynecologic pathologic entities that can be detected. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2017.",Excluded
103,"Re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors. Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of survival for patients with recurrent gliomas treated with reirradiation, and to identify subgroups for whom re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas is most beneficial. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas received re-irradiation between 1996 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 43 years (range, 20-63 years). Pathologic subtypes were glioblastomas in 21 patients (58.3%), WHO grade III astrocytomas in 8 patients (22.2%), and WHO grade I/II astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas in 7 patients (19.4%). In 27 patients, re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas was preceded by subtotal (19/36; 52.8%) or total (8/36; 22.2%) tumor resection. The median time interval between initial radiation therapy (RT) and re-irradiation was 30.5 months (range, 4-173 months). Radiation doses of the first and second radiation course were 32.4-70.0 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) and 30.0-64.6 Gy (median 45 Gy). The cumulative radiation doses were 82.8-123.0 Gy (median 100.2 Gy), and the median cumulative biological equivalent doses (BED) were 195.8 (a/b = 2 Gy) and 102.3 Gy (a/b = 10 Gy). All patients were followed-up until death or the time of analysis. Result(s): Thirty-two patients died of disease 2-50 months after re-irradiation and one patient was alive with disease 12 months after re-irradiation. Three patients are alive without disease 8-50 months after re-irradiation. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months (range, 2-50 months), and the 6 and 12months OS rates were 83.3 and 39.4%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months, and 6-months and 12-months PFS rates were 71.09 and 41.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <=70 (p<0.001), the dose of re-irradiation <=40 Gy(p = 0.019), and the length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation(p = 0.029) were associated with improvement in OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p=0.033) was the most important predictors for OS. Histologic subtype (GBM vs non-GBM, median OS, 8 vs 12 months, p=0.668) and surgical resection (median OS, 9 vs 12 months, p = 0.810) had no significant benefit on OS. Radiographically suspected radiation necrosis (RN) after re-irradiation was seen in 6 patients (16.7%) whose median cumulative radiation doses were 100.4 Gy, and a median cumulative BED were 198.4 Gy (a/b=2 Gy). At 3, 7 and 8 months after re-irradiation, neurological deterioration occurred in 3 patients, and was managed with dexamethasone and anticonvulsant drug. Conclusion(s): Approximately 45 Gy of re-irradiation after 60 Gy of initial radiation therapy was feasible without serious complications. Re-irradiation could be suggested as an alternative salvage treatment for selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and recurrence over a longer period of time.",Excluded

604,"Zonisamide in Brain Tumor-Related Epilepsy: An Observational Pilot Study. OBJECTIVES: Epilepsy heavily affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients with brain tumor because in addition to taking treatments for the oncological illness, patients are required to live with the long-term taking of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The AEDs' adverse effects are common in these patients and can negatively influence their perceptions of their QoL. We conducted an observational pilot study in patients with brain tumor-related epilepsy to verify efficacy, tolerability, and impact on QoL and global neurocognitive performances of zonisamide (ZNS) in add-on.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 13 patients (5 females, 8 males; mean age, 49.6 years) presenting uncontrolled seizures. At first visit and at final follow-up at 6 months, patients underwent neurological examination, evaluation of adverse events, and cognitive and QoL tests. A seizure diary was given.RESULTS: Eight patients underwent chemotherapy, 3 underwent radiotherapy, and 5 had disease progression. Mean dosage of ZNS at final follow-up was 300 mg/d.Of 9 patients who reached the sixth month follow-up, the mean weekly seizure number before ZNS had been 3.2 +/- 5.0, and at final follow-up, the mean weekly seizure number was 0.18 +/- 0.41 (P = 0.05). Compared with baseline, we observed stability in all cognitive domains, except for verbal fluency that significantly worsened. Results on QoL tests showed that QoL remained unchanged over time, which could indicate that ZNS did not influence the patients' perceived QoL.CONCLUSIONS: Zonisamide as add-on in our patients seems to be well tolerated and efficacious in controlling seizures. Despite having limitations represented by the fact that our study is observational, with a small study population and a short follow-up period, our results confirm that when choosing an AED, in addition to efficacy, the drug's effect on patients' QoL also needs to be considered, especially for patients facing many psychosocial challenges, such as those with brain tumor-related epilepsy.",Excluded

SXC-1800 waveguides (IT'IS-Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland) were modified for in vitro exposure to the EDGE signal radiofrequency (RF) radiation at 1800 MHz. Four exposure conditions were tested: 2 and 10 W/kg for 1 and 24 h. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry using the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe at the end of the 24-h exposure or 24 h after the 1-h exposure. Rotenone treatment was used as a positive control. All cells tested responded to rotenone treatment by increasing ROS production. These findings indicate that exposure to the EDGE signal does not induce oxidative stress under these test conditions, including 10 W/kg. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings that RF radiation alone does not increase ROS production.",Excluded

PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of fractionated radiation treatments on the life spans of athymic rats bearing intracerebral brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: U-251 MG or U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells were implanted into the brains of athymic rats, and the resulting tumors were irradiated once daily with various doses of ionizing radiation for 5 consecutive days or for 10 days with a 2-day break after Day 5.RESULTS: Five daily doses of 1 and 1.5 Gy, and 10 doses of 0.75 and 1 Gy, cured some U-251 MG tumors. However, five daily doses of 0.5 Gy increased the survival time of animals bearing U-251 MG tumors 5 days without curing any animals of their tumors. Ten doses of 0.3 Gy given over 2 weeks extended the lifespan of the host animals 9 days without curing any animals. For U-87 MG tumors, 5 daily doses of 3 Gy produced an increased lifespan of 8 days without curing any animals, and 10 doses of 1 Gy prolonged lifespan 5.5 days without curing any animals. The differences in extension of life span between the 5- and 10-fraction protocols were minor for either tumor type.CONCLUSION: The finding that the U-251 MG tumors are more sensitive than U-87 MG tumors, despite the fact that U-251 MG tumors contain many more hypoxic cells than U-87 MG tumors, suggests the intrinsic cellular radiosensitivities of these cell lines are more important than hypoxia in determining their in vivo radiosensitivities.",Excluded

Two clinical trials are currently running at the Finnish dedicated boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) facility. Between May 1999 and December 2001, 18 patients with supratentorial glioblastoma were treated with boronophenylalanine (BPA)-based BNCT within a context of a prospective clinical trial (protocol P-01). All patients underwent prior surgery, but none had received conventional radiotherapy or cancer chemotherapy before BNCT. BPA-fructose was given as 2-h infusion at BPA-dosages ranging from 290 to 400 mg/kg prior to neutron beam irradiation, which was given as a single fraction from two fields. The average planning target volume dose ranged from 30 to 61 Gy (W), and the average normal brain dose from 3 to 6 Gy (W). The treatment was generally well tolerated, and none of the patients have died during the first months following BNCT. The estimated 1-year overall survival is 61%. In another trial (protocol P-03), three patients with recurring or progressing glioblastoma following surgery and conventional cranial radiotherapy to 50-60 Gy, were treated with BPA-based BNCT using the BPA dosage of 290 mg/kg. The average planning target dose in these patients was 25-29 Gy (W), and the average whole brain dose 2-3 Gy (W). All three patients tolerated brain reirradiation with BNCT, and none died during the first three months following BNCT. We conclude that BPA-based BNCT has been relatively well tolerated both in previously irradiated and unirradiated glioblastoma patients. Efficacy comparisons with conventional photon radiation are difficult due to patient selection and confounding factors such as other treatments given, but the results support continuation of clinical research on BPA-based BNCT.",Excluded

In the present case report the radiotherapy technique combining whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal sparing (hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiotherapy HA-WBRT) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of the brain metastases is performed in a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. HA-WBRT was administered to 30 Gy in 10 fractions with sparing of the hippocampal structures and SRT of 21 Gy in 3 fractions to brain metastases which has preceded the HA-WBRT. Two single arc volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) plans were prepared using Monaco planning software. The HA-WBRT treatment plan achieved the following results: D2=33.91 Gy, D98=25.20 Gy, D100=14.18 Gy, D50=31.26 Gy.

2952,"An exploration of the factor structure and development of potentially useful subscales of etiological beliefs about schizophrenia in a general population sample. Background: Given that accessing care, treatment engagement, and course and outcomes among people with schizophrenia may be influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community, causal beliefs about schizophrenia have been studied in numerous communities around the world. In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by Angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method(s): Data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern United States: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Result(s): Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach's internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals.

636,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme: The First Experiences in the Czech Republic. [Slovak]. Background. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its treatment remains unsatisfactory with very limited overall survival. In the year 2001, in cooperation with Department of Neurosurgery, Nemocnice Na Homolce and Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, we have started to treat glioblastoma patients with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Methods and Results. Cells of malignant brain tumors, especially that of glioblastomas, are able to accumulate boron compounds. If BNCT should be successful, it is necessary to reach selective accumulation of sufficient amount of 10B in the tumor and low accumulation in the normal brain tissue. After BSH administration, radiation with low energy thermal neutrons is delivered. It results in nuclear capture and fission reactions with subsequent selective damage of tumor cells. At the time of analysis 9 patients have been enrolled. Therapy was completed in 5 patients. Treatment has been very well tolerated. We observed minimal acute toxicity associated with radiation and no laboratory abnormalities after administrations of BSH. Unfortunately treatment results were quite unsatisfactory. The median time to progression and overall survival were shorter then expected with conventional treatment. Conclusions. BNCT is very well tolerated with only a modest toxicity. In contrast to standard radiation, BNCT patients receive only one dose of radiation. Nevertheless, in this small pilot study first results were inferior when compared either to outcomes of conventional therapy or to results reported from other BNCT groups. It might be explained that lower dose of radiation had been used. Further study will show whether the higher dose radiation can improve treatment results.",Excluded
2997,"Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields Promote In Vitro Neuronal Differentiation and Neurite Outgrowth of Embryonic Neural Stem Cells via Up-Regulating TRPC1. Exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. However, little is focused on the effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we studied the potential effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neural stem cells (eNSCs). We exposed eNSCs to ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 1, 2, and 3 days with 4 hours per day. We found that eNSC proliferation and maintenance were significantly enhanced after ELF-EMF exposure in proliferation medium. ELF-EMF exposure increased the ratio of differentiated neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth of eNSC-derived neurons without influencing astrocyes differentiation and the cell apoptosis. In addition, the expression of the proneural genes, NeuroD and Ngn1, which are crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, was increased after ELF-EMF exposure. Moreover, the expression of transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) was significantly up-regulated accompanied by increased the peak amplitude of intracellular calcium level induced by ELF-EMF. Furthermore, silencing TRPC1 expression eliminated the up-regulation of the proneural genes and the promotion of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth induced by ELF-EMF. These results suggest that ELF-EMF exposure promotes the neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of eNSCs via up-regulation the expression of TRPC1 and proneural genes (NeuroD and Ngn1).

822,"Sex-dependent differences in the activity and modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons. Women have greater temporal summation of experimental pain stimuli and also have a higher propensity for developing chronic visceral pain conditions. Sex hormone-mediated regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in nociceptive pathways is a plausible mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in modulation of NMDAR activity in adult male and female rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons were collected from adult male or female rats and grown in short-term culture in steroid-free media. NMDAR currents were recorded on small to medium size neurons by whole cell patch clamp using rapid perfusion with saturating concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid and glycine in the absence of extracellular Mg(2+). We found that the average density of NMDAR currents was 2.8-fold larger in DRG neurons from female rats compared with male rats (P<0.0001). Addition of 100 nM E2 increased NMDAR currents 55+/-15% in female neurons, but only 19+/-7% in male neurons. Potentiation was maximal after 20-40 min and dose dependent with an apparent 50% excitatory concentration of 17-23 nM. This effect was mimicked by E2 conjugated to BSA and attenuated by pretreatment with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A (1 microM) or the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182,780 (1 microM), strongly suggesting activation of a cell surface ER acting through a non-genomic mechanism involving protein tyrosine kinases to increase NMDAR currents.

2339,Correlations of neuronal spike discharges of VL neurons during spontaneous firing and during the activity evoked by peripheral stimulation. The temporal relations between simultaneously recorded neurons of the nucleus ventralis lateralis (VL) of cat thalamus were studied. The interaction and the functional connections between individual VL neurons are described. This was achieved with an application of cross correlation techniques. The response patterns of different individual neurons to somatic sensory and photic stimuli were also analyzed. For the purpose of classifying neurons as thalamocortical relay cells (T-C) and non relay cells (N-C) which do not project to the motor sensory cortex antidromic cortical stimulation was used. This stimulation was also used as conditioning one when proceeded peripheral stimuli. To analyze the nonspecific specific interactions upon single neurons conditioning photic stimuli were applied. The results show that T-C neurons are antidromically excited from a wide cortical areas and that the functional interaction between T-C neurons is mediated by a shared input from common sources. It is further postulated that N-C cells interposed between relay neurons subserve the functions of gating units modifying the neuronal network of lateral ventral nucleus of the thalamus.,Excluded

However, this effect has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients. We have currently found a technical solution to this problem. Our current protocol for WBRT+SIB is presented and described, incluiding a retrospective review of the results in relation to radiation-induced alopecia. Material(s) and Method(s): The protocol already implemented in our department is based on a frame-less procedure compatible with masks of type 35764/2MA/M (Orfit Industries N.V., Wijnegem, Belgium), submasks of eXaSkin (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain) and a resonance compatible frame eXaFrame (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain).

Two CCW VMAT arcs (178degree to 60degree and 300degree to 182degree) are added, with the following objectives: Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 1), brain-CPE (D<inf>max</inf>= 21 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 20 Gy, weight = 50), eyes(D<inf>max</inf>= 10 Gy, weight = 1). Thereafter, we work separately on the metastases blocking the optimization of the prophylaxis and creating three structures: VI1 = PTV (MTS1)+ 5 mm, VI2 = PTV (MTS2)+ 5 mm, Epx = brain-VI1-VI2. Objectives were: PTVI (D<inf>max</inf>= 44 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 40 Gy weight = 50), Epx (D<inf>max</inf>= 30 Gy) ,brain stem (D<inf>max</inf>= 23 Gy) and Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 20). Result(s): We have treated 14 patients until now. Fusion images have shown differences less than 1mm while mean IGRT correction has been 1.34mm. No acute toxicity have been observed, including neither alopecia nor temporal depilation. Conclusion(s): This protocol has been designed and developed in our hospital, considering the alopecia as toxicity in VMAT optimization. It produces excellent cosmetic results, avoiding alopecia in practically all cases, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. As a general consideration, we would like to point out that that it should be considered mandatory to use all advanced tools available on modern radiotherapy to minimize toxicity in radiation treatments.",Excluded
1936,"The diagnostic accuracy of chromatic pupillary light responses in diseases of the outer and inner retina. PURPOSE: To compare the chromatic pupillary light responses (PLR) in healthy subjects with those from patients with diseases of the outer or inner retina under various stimulus conditions, and to ascertain the parameters required to optimally distinguish between disease and control groups.METHODS: Fifteen patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), 19 patients with optic nerve disease (ON), and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled in this prospective study. ON included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12 s, and for stimulus intensities of 4 lx and 28 lx.RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3 s and 7 s after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4 lx, 4 s yellow stimulus are significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4 s, 28 lx blue stimulus at 7 s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON vs RP patients with a high specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one another. The optimal stimuli for future protocols was found to be a 4 s blue stimulus at 28 lx, and a 4 s yellow stimulus at 4 lx.",Excluded
2491,"The distribution of thirteen GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. III. Embryonic and postnatal development. The embryonic and postnatal expression of 13 GABAA receptor subunit genes in the rat CNS was studied by in situ hybridization. Each transcript exhibited a unique regional and temporal developmental expression profile. For example, in both embryonic and early postnatal cortex and thalamus, expression of the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 3 mRNAs was pronounced. In particular, the alpha 5 gene expression underwent a prominent peak in early brain. Subsequently, the thalamocortical expression of these four genes substantially diminished and was superseded in the adult by the alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta subunit mRNAs. Similarly, gamma 1 and gamma 3 gene expression also dropped markedly during development, their initial stronger expression being restricted to relatively few structures. In contrast, gamma 2 gene expression was widespread and mostly remained constant with increasing age. The medial septum and globus pallidus were regions expressing few subunits in both early postnatal and adult stages, allowing clear developmental combinatorial changes to be inferred (alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 1 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1/gamma 2, respectively). In contrast, cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibited no developmental switch, expressing only the alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs from birth to adult. Certain GABAA transcripts were also detected in germinal zones (e.g., beta 1, beta 3, gamma 1) and in embryonic peripheral tissues such as dorsal root ganglia (e.g., alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 3, gamma 2) and intestine (gamma 3). Some parallels in regional and temporal CNS expression were noted (e.g., alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 3, alpha 4/alpha 6 delta), whereas the alpha 5 and beta 1 regional mRNA expressions converted over time. The changes of GABAA receptor subunit gene expression suggest a molecular explanation for earlier observations on changing ligand binding affinities. Thus, the composition, and presumably properties, of embryonic/early postnatal rat GABAA receptors differs markedly from those expressed in the adult brain.",Excluded
3210,"Investigation of higher-order cognitive functions during exposure to a high static magnetic field. PURPOSE: To test for potential changes in higher-order cognitive processes related to the exposure to a high static magnetic field.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers participated in two experimental sessions inside a 3 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet. During one session the magnetic field was ramped down. The tasks consisted of six well-established paradigms probing a variety of cognitive functions. Reaction times (RT) and accuracies (AC) were recorded for statistical analysis.RESULTS: The overall performance was very similar in both sessions. Strong task-specific effects (all P < 0.006) were consistent with previously published results. Direct comparisons of task-specific effects between the two sessions (magnetic field on or off) remained insignificance for all paradigms (RT: all P > 0.196; AC: all P > 0.17; no corrections for multiple comparisons).CONCLUSION: The results did not indicate any apparent safety concerns with respect to cognitive performance in a static magnetic field of a typical whole-body magnet. In addition, comparisons of cognitive effects from testing situations with and without exposure to high static magnetic fields can be considered valid.",Excluded

346,"Postnatal development under conditions of simulated weightlessness and space flight. The adaptability of the developing nervous system to environmental influences and the mechanisms underlying this plasticity has recently become a subject of interest in space neuroscience. Ground studies on neonatal rats using the tail suspension model of weightlessness have shown that the force of gravity clearly influences the events underlying the postnatal development of motor function. These effects depend on the age of the animal, duration of the perturbation and the motor function studied. A nine-day flight study has shown that a dam and neonates can develop under conditions of space flight. The motor function of the flight animals after landing was consistent with that seen in the tail suspension studies, being marked by limb joint extension. However, there were expected differences due to: (1) the unloading of the vestibular system in flight, which did not occur in the ground-based experiments; (2) differences between flight and suspension durations; and (3) the inability to evaluate motor function during the flight. The next step is to conduct experiments in space with the flexibility and rigor that is now limited to ground studies: an opportunity offered by the International Space Station.",Excluded
100,"Repeat stereotactic radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas. PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for acoustic neuromas, we assessed tumor control, clinical outcomes, and the risk of adverse radiation effects in patients whose tumors progressed after initial management.METHODS AND MATERIALS: During a 21-year experience at our center, 1,352 patients underwent SRS as management for their acoustic neuromas. We retrospectively identified 6 patients who underwent SRS twice for the same tumor. The median patient age was 47 years (range, 35-71 years). All patients had imaging evidence of tumor progression despite initial SRS. One patient also had incomplete surgical resection after initial SRS. All patients were deaf at the time of the second SRS. The median radiosurgery target volume at the time of the initial SRS was 0.5 cc and was 2.1 cc at the time of the second SRS. The median margin dose at the time of the initial SRS was 13 Gy and was 11 Gy at the time of the second SRS. The median interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS was 63 months (range, 25-169 months).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months after the second SRS (range, 13-71 months), tumor control or regression was achieved in all 6 patients. No patient developed symptomatic adverse radiation effects or new neurological symptoms after the second SRS.CONCLUSIONS: With this limited experience, we found that repeat SRS for a persistently enlarging acoustic neuroma can be performed safely and effectively.",Excluded
142,"Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in HER-2 positive breast cancer with brain metastasis: a single-centre experience. Objective: To determine the characteristics and prognosis of brain metastasised HER-2 positive breast cancer (BC) patients. Study Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Turkey between 2000 and 2019. Methodology: HER-2 positive BC patients were analysed retrospectively and 105 patients were included in the study. Age 18 years and over, HER-2 positive BC, with BM (brain metastases) were the inclusion criteria. Patients with secondary malignancies, those with missing data, and irregular follow-up were excluded from the study. The age, type of treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score, BM date, and the last contact date of the patients were obtained from the hospital records. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the time to BM and OS. Independent factors affecting OS and time to BM were determined using the Cox regression model. Result(s): Patients with ECOG PS score of 0-1 at the time of the BM had 19 months median overall survival (OS), while patients with ECOG PS score of 2 had 8 months (p <0.01). Median OS after BM was 32 and 14 months for patients with one BM and patients with multiple BM, respectively (p <0.01). Multivariate cox regression analyses revealed that time to progression of BM was shorter in patients with high-grade tumors compared to patients with low-grade tumors (p= 0.048), and in patients with de-novo metastasis compared to patients without de-novo metastasis (p= 0.003). Conclusion: Tumor grade and de-novo metastasis (extracranial metastasis at the time of diagnosis) are independent predictive factors that may cause the earlier occurrence of BM and affect mortality in BC patients.

406,"Expandable intramedullary nails for fixation of tibial shaft fractures. Interlocking intramedullary nailing is currently the preferred treatment for most tibial fractures requiring operative treatment, with good results and a relatively low complication rate as reported in large clinical series. However, vascular and neurological complications caused by interlocking screws have been reported. In addition, insertion of distal interlocking screws can be technically demanding and may entail substantial exposure. We present the results with an expandable self-locking nail in the management of 52 AO type A and B tibial shaft fractures. The mean time to union was 15.8 weeks and the rate of union was 98%. The average surgical time was 60 minutes. Complications were those usually seen in diaphysis nailing and no complication was noted during nail expansion. Interlocking screws are not necessary, which reduces the risk of iatrogenic lesions. The expandable nail allows effective management of AO type A and B diaphyseal fractures of the tibia, a lower radiation exposure and shorter operative time.",Excluded
1633,"Nitric oxide as a mediator of parasympathetic vasodilation in ocular and extraocular tissues in the rabbit. Purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate in rabbits the relationship between nitric oxide and the noncholinergic vasodilation caused by facial nerve stimulation in the eye and some extraocular tissues. Methods. Uveal vascular resistance was determined by measuring simultaneously the flow from a cannulated vortex vein with intraocular pressure and arterial blood pressure recordings. The local blood flow in different parts of the eye (iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retina), eyelids, nictitating membrane, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland was determined using radioactive microspheres. The effects of facial nerve stimulation, at different frequencies, were examined before and alter the administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. Results. In the experiments with direct determination of uveal blood flow, stimulation of the facial nerve caused a frequency-dependent decrease in uveal vascular resistance, indicating vasodilation. This effect was reduced or abolished by NOS inhibition at low frequencies but was unaffected at high frequencies. Determination of regional blood flow, with radioactive microspheres, showed that the stimulation increased local blood flow in all parts of the urea. Compared to the nonstimulated control side, stimulation at 2 Hz increased choroidal blood flow by 89% +/- 12% before NOS inhibition and by 45% +/- 10% after NOS inhibition, a difference of 44% +/- 77% (n = 9; P <= 0.05). Iris and ciliary body vasodilation appeared to be equally reduced. In eyelids, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland, the vasodilation elicited by stimulation at 2 Hz was abolished almost completely by NOS inhibition. The vasodilation in most of the extraocular tissues was reduced significantly by NOS inhibition at 5 Hz, with only a slight reduction in the choroid, iris, and ciliary body. Retinal blood flow also was significantly increased by facial nerve stimulation at 2 Hz and 5 Hz. The increase in retinal blood flow appeared to be more sensitive to NOS inhibition than the increase in uveal blood flow. Conclusions. These results suggest that the formation of nitric oxide plays an important role in the uveal, retinal, and extraocular vasodilation brought about by facial nerve stimulation at low frequencies. At high frequencies, other neurotransmitters also seem to be involved.",Excluded

3332,"Exposure to 2.45 GHz Radiation Triggers Changes in HSP-70, Glucocorticoid Receptors and GFAP Biomarkers in Rat Brain. Brain tissue may be especially sensitive to electromagnetic phenomena provoking signs of neural stress in cerebral activity. Fifty-four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ELISA and immunohistochemistry testing of four relevant anatomical areas of the cerebrum to measure biomarkers indicating induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70), glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) after single or repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz radiation in the experimental set-up. Neither radiation regime caused tissue heating, so thermal effects can be ruled out. A progressive decrease in GCR and HSP-70 was observed after acute or repeated irradiation in the somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. In the limbic cortex; however, values for both biomarkers were significantly higher after repeated exposure to irradiation when compared to control animals. GFAP values in brain tissue after irradiation were not significantly different or were even lower than those of nonirradiated animals in all brain regions studied. Our results suggest that repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz elicited GCR/HSP-70 dysregulation in the brain, triggering a state of stress that could decrease tissue anti-inflammatory action without favoring glial proliferation and make the nervous system more vulnerable.",Excluded

Thirty-three subjects participated in the study and performed same auditory selective attention task in which the odd numbers in a randomly mixed series of odd and even numbers (go/no-go) presented acoustically in Chinese pronunciation were assigned as target signal during the rotation stimuli. The results showed that the P3 latency induced by target signal and the NIP2, P2N2 and N2P3 peak-to-peak amplitudes decreased significantly during constant 10degree/s rotation in contrast to control and constant angular acceleration. The P3 latency induced by target signal was shorter during constant 0.6degree/s <sup>2</sup> and 1.2degree/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration rotations than that during constant 0.8degree/s<sup>2</sup> and 1.0degree/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration rotations.

1385,"Point process analysis of noise in early invertebrate vision. Noise is a prevalent and sometimes even dominant aspect of many biological processes. While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance. This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To report our 20 yr experience of definitive radiotherapy for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation records of 141 patients were retrospectively evaluated for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Cox proportional hazard models were used to perform univariate (UVA) and multivariate analyses (MVA). Cause specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were plotted using cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meir curves, respectively.RESULTS: Of the 91% patients that presented with impaired voice, 73% noted significant improvement. Chronic laryngeal edema and dysphagia were noted in 18% and 7%, respectively. The five year LC was 94% (T1a), 83% (T1b), 87% (T2a), 65% (T2b); the ten year LC was 89% (T1a), 83% (T1b), 87% (T2a), and 53% (T2b).

The inclusion of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials of patients with CNS tumors is increasing. Neurocognitive end points are used to understand what cognitive problems exist before treatment to establish a baseline by which the effect of treatment is judged, and to determine whether different treatment regimens improve neurocognitive function due to better tumor control, slow expected neurocognitive deterioration due to the tumor, or have more or less short- and long-term neurotoxicity. However, the use of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials for patients with CNS tumors is in its infancy, so that long-term outcomes are difficult to predict and the ability to determine the effects of different agents and treatment approaches is scant.

Few therapeutic strategies exist for the treatment of metastatic tumor cells in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access. Thus the identification of molecular targets and accompanying BBB permeable drugs will significantly benefit brain metastasis patients. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an attractive molecular target because it is only expressed in dividing cells and its expression is upregulated in many tumors. Analysis of a publicly available database of human breast cancer metastases revealed Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in brain metastases compared to systemic metastases (P = 0.0018). The selective Plk1 inhibitor, GSK461364A, showed substantial uptake in normal rodent brain. Using a breast cancer brain metastatic xenograft model (231-BR), we tested the efficacy of GSK461364A to prevent brain metastatic colonization. When treatment was started 3 days post-injection, GSK461364A at 50 mg/kg inhibited the development of large brain metastases 62% (P = 0.0001) and prolonged survival by 17%. GSK461364A sensitized tumor cells to radiation induced cell death in vitro. Previously, it was reported that mutations in p53 might render tumor cells more sensitive to Plk1 inhibition; however, p53 mutations are uncommon in breast cancer. In a cohort of 41 primary breast tumors and matched brain metastases, p53 immunostaining was increased in 61% of metastases; 44% of which were associated with primary tumors with low p53.

Purpose: This work was designed to study the effectiveness of radiation protection caps in lowering the dose to the brain and the eye lens during fluoroscopically guided interventions. Material(s) and Method(s): Two types of radiation protection caps were examined with regards to their capacity to lower the radiation dose. One cap is equipped with lateral flaps, the other one is not. These caps were fitted to the head of an anthropomorphic Alderson-Rando (A.-R.) phantom. The phantom was positioned aside an angiographic table simulating the position of the first operator during a peripheral arterial intervention. One of the brain slices and both eyes of the A.-R. phantom were equipped with thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs). Result(s): The analysis of the data showed that the cap without lateral flaps reduced the dose to the brain by 11,5-27,5 percent depending on the position within the brain. The cap with lateral protection flaps achieved a shielding effect between 44,7 and 78,9 percent. When evaluating the dose to the eye, we did see an increase of dose reduction from 63,3 to 66,5 percent in the left eye and from 45,8 to 46,8 percent in the right eye for the cap without lateral protection. When wearing the cap with lateral protection we observed an increase of dose reduction from 63,4 to 67,2 percent in the left eye and from 45,8 to 50,0 percent in the right eye.

The purpose of this study was to develop methods for the production of high levels of (211)At and the radiosynthesis of clinically useful amounts of (211)At-labeled human/mouse chimeric 81C6 antibody.METHODS: (211)At was produced through the (209)Bi(alpha, 2n)(211)At reaction using an internal target system and purified by a dry distillation process. Antibody labeling was accomplished by first synthesizing N-succinimidyl 3-[(211)At]astatobenzoate from the corresponding tri-n-butyl tin precursor and reacting it with the antibody in pH 8.5 borate buffer. Quality control procedures consisted of methanol precipitation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and pyrogen and sterility assays, as well as determination of the immunoreactive fraction by a rapid procedure using a recombinant tenascin fragment coupled to magnetic beads.RESULTS: A total of 16 antibody labeling runs were performed. Using beam currents of 50-60 microA alpha-particles and irradiation times of 1.5-4.5 h, the mean (211)At production yield was 27.75 +/- 2.59 MBq/microA.h, and the maximum level of (211)At produced was 6.59 GBq after a 4-h irradiation at 55 microA. The decay-corrected distillation yield was 67% +/- 16%. The yield for the coupling of the (211)At-labeled active ester to the antibody was 76% +/- 8%. The fraction of (211)At activity that eluted with a retention time corresponding to intact IgG on HPLC was 96.0% +/- 2.5%.

The indisputable efficacy of adjuvant cerebral irradiation contrasts with the absence of any significant improvement in survival time: 2 patients are alive and in complete remission, 1 in each group, while the mean survival was 12.3 and 11.7 months respectively. This is explained by the continued occurrence of extra-cerebral metastatic deposits such as in the liver or mediastinum where the efficacy of systemic therapy remains uncertain.

Multiphase CT Angiography (mCTA) provides an overview of cerebrovascular hemodynamics, acute stroke pathophysiology, and collateral circulation, accounting for these variables allows physicians to make more individualized therapeutic decision. Imaging of collateral circulation and determination of collateral grade may predict greater reperfusion, lower hemorrhage risk, and better functional outcome. mCTA asseses cerebral circulation, from arterial inflow routes to the micro-circulation and downstream venous channels involved in sustaining collateral perfusion and protect the brain against ischemia and sustain the penumbra The currently available knowledge has increased the pathophysiologic understanding of intrinsic compensatory vascular mechanisms, supports the use of mCTA technique to rapidly evaluate AIS (Acute ischemic stroke), and provides evidence for therapeutic decisions. Role of collaterals is important critical selection criteria for intervention, with triage based on collateral score rather than time alone. Copyright © 2019",Excluded

255,"Clinical and histopathologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) after stereotactic radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma entails uncertain long-term risk of tumor recurrence and delayed cranial neuropathies. In addition, the underlying histopathologic changes to the tumor bed are not fully characterized. We seek to understand the clinical and histologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiation therapy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Four patients who underwent microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma after primary stereotactic radiation therapy.INTERVENTION: Patients were treated primarily with gamma knife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy followed by salvage microsurgery. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was used in all cases.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathologic review. Preoperative and postoperative facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann scale.RESULTS: We observed highly inconsistent radiation changes in the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal. Fibrosis outside and within the tumor bed varied markedly, complicating microsurgical dissection. Light microscopy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in all cases. Histopathologic features were typical of vestibular schwannoma, and there was no significant scarring that could be attributed to radiation effect.CONCLUSIONS: The variable fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle and lack of radiation changes seen histopathologically in irradiated vestibular schwannoma suggest that a uniform treatment effect was not achieved in these cases. Although all four patients with preoperative cranial neuropathies were found intraoperatively to have fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle, excellent preservation of facial nerve anatomy and function was possible with salvage microsurgical resection. Additional analyses are needed to clarify the histopathologic and molecular characteristics associated with vestibular schwannoma growth after stereotactic radiation. [References: 58]",Excluded

Discerning between primary brain tumor progression and treatment-related effect is a significant issue and a major challenge in neuro-oncology. The difficulty in differentiating tumor progression from treatment-related effects has important implications for treatment decisions and prognosis, as well as for clinical trial design and results. Conventional MRI is widely used to assess disease status, but cannot reliably distinguish between tumor progression and treatment-related effects. Several advanced imaging techniques are promising, but have yet to be prospectively validated for this use. This review explores two treatment-related effects, pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis, as well as the concept of pseudoresponse, and highlights several advanced imaging modalities and the evidence supporting their use in differentiating tumor progression from treatment-related effect.",Excluded
1754,"Characterization of bone mineral crystals in horse radius by small-angle X-ray scattering. The size and the orientation of the bone salt (mineral) crystals in the cranial and caudal zones in the transverse midshaft section of the equine radius were investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results are interpreted as indicating that the crystals had an elongated shape with an average thickness of T = 3.17 +/- 0. 15 nm in the caudal region and T = 3.79 +/- 0.20 nm in the cranial region. Their orientation was predominantly in the longitudinal direction of the bone. There was no preferential orientation within the transverse plane. The distribution of tilt angles with respect to the longitudinal direction was determined directly from the SAXS data: the average angle was about 30 degrees for the cranial region and 45 degrees for the caudal region. Assuming that the needle-like crystals are parallel with the collagen fibrils, the angular distribution of the crystals is in good agreement with previous measurements of collagen orientation using circularly polarized light microscopy.",Excluded

162,"Thermoregulation in pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana, Ord) in winter. Conservation of energy is a prerequisite thermoregulatory strategy for survival in northern hemisphere winters. We have used thermistor/data logger assemblies to measure temperatures in the brain, carotid artery, jugular vein and abdominal cavity, in pronghorn antelope to determine their winter body temperature and to investigate whether the carotid rete has a survival role. Over the study period mean black globe and air temperature were -0.5+/-3.2 degrees C and -2.0+/-3.4 degrees C, respectively, and mean daytime solar radiation was approximately 186 W m(-2). Brain temperature (T(brain), 39.3+/-0.3 degrees C) was higher than carotid blood temperature (T(carotid), 38.5+/-0.4 degrees C), and higher than jugular temperature (T(jugular), 37.9+/-0.7 degrees C). Minimum T(brain) (38.5+/-0.4 degrees C) and T(carotid) (37.8+/-0.2 degrees C) in winter were higher than the minimum T(brain) (37.7+/-0.5 degrees C) and T(carotid) (36.4+/-0.8 degrees C) in summer that we have reported previously. Compared with summer, winter body temperature patterns were characterized by an absence of selective brain cooling (SBC), a higher range of T(brain), a range of T(carotid) that was significantly narrower (1.8 degrees C) than in summer (3.1 degrees C), and changes in T(carotid) and T(brain) that were more highly correlated (r=0.99 in winter vs r=0.83 in summer). These findings suggest that in winter the effects of the carotid rete are reduced, which eliminates SBC and prevents independent regulation of T(brain), thus coupling T(brain) to T(carotid). The net effect is that T(carotid) varies little. A possible consequence is depression of metabolism, with the survival advantage of conservation of energy. These findings also suggest that the carotid rete has wider thermoregulatory effects than its traditional SBC function.",Excluded
644,"Radiation as a local ablative therapy option for oligoprogressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with osimertinib. Purpose/Objective(s): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved response rate and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their efficacy is limited by acquired resistance and disease progression. Local ablative therapy (LAT) has shown a survival benefit in patients with oligometastatic disease in retrospective studies. At our institution, we are conducting a prospective single-arm Phase 2 study of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI. Following LAT to the sites of progression with either radiation or surgery, patients are re-initiated on osimertinib. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and efficacy of re-initiation of osimertinib, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that osimertinib and radiation can be safely administered sequentially, and that LAT followed by re-initiation of osimertinib will result in improved PFS. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with no prior EGFR-TKI exposure (cohort 1) or progression after 1st/2nd generation EGFR-TKIs with acquired T790M mutation (cohort 2) receive osimertinib. Upon progression, eligible patients with <=5 progressing sites undergo LAT by either radiation therapy or surgery, then resume osimertinib until further disease progression. Patients previously treated with osimertinib with disease progression who qualify for LAT are also eligible (cohort 3). Prior to beginning radiation, patients must be off osimertinib for at least 2 wks, and total time off osimertinib must be less than 8 wks. Result(s): Fifteen patients with a median age of 57 (range 36-71) were enrolled between 4/2016 and 1/2017 (cohorts 1/2/3: 9/3/3 patients). Overall, treatment has been well tolerated, with rash, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and alanine transaminase elevation the most common adverse events (AEs). Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 4 (27%) patients. Objective response rates among evaluable patients prior to LAT in cohorts 1 and 2 were 71% (5/7) and 100% (2/2), respectively. Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI: 3.4 mo-undefined) in cohort 1; there have been no progressions in cohort 2. To date, 2/5 patients receiving LAT have received radiation (both in cohort 3). One patient received 5 Gy x 5 to 2 lung lesions, while the other received 24 Gy and 18 Gy by stereotactic radiosurgery to 2 brain metastases. Additional endpoints include assessment of mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib by multi-omics analyses of tumor, blood, and saliva; results from these analyses will also be presented. Conclusion(s): Oligoprogressive disease can be safely treated with LAT, including radiation therapy, in patients with limited metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR-TKI therapy. This approach could potentially prevent premature switching to other, less-effective systemic therapies by maximizing the duration and efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment in selected patients.",Excluded
2813,"Proposed mechanism for reduced jugular vein flow in microgravity. Internal jugular flow is reduced in space compared with supine values, which can be associated with internal jugular vein (IJV) thrombosis. The mechanism is unknown but important to understand to prevent potentially serious vein thromboses on long duration flights. We used a novel, microgravity-focused numerical model of the cranial vascular circulation to develop hypotheses for the reduced flow. This model includes the effects of removing hydrostatic gradients and tissue compressive forces - unique effects of weightlessness. The IJV in the model incorporates sensitivity to transmural pressure across the vein, which can dramatically affect resistance and flow in the vein. The model predicts reduced IJV flow in space. Although tissue weight in the neck is reduced in weightlessness, increasing transmural pressure, this is more than offset by the reduction in venous pressure produced by the loss of hydrostatic gradients and tissue pressures throughout the body. This results in a negative transmural pressure and increased IJV resistance. Unlike the IJV, the walls of the vertebral plexus are rigid; transmural pressure does not affect its resistance and so its flow increases in microgravity. This overall result is supported by spaceflight measurements, showing reduced IJV area inflight compared with supine values preflight. Significantly, this hypothesis suggests that interventions that further decrease internal IJV pressure (such as lower body negative pressure), which are not assisted by other drainage mechanisms (e.g. gravity), might lead to stagnant flow or IJV collapse with reduced flow, which could increase rather than decrease the risk of venous thrombosis.

281,"Radiosurgery in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas: Experience at the Carlos Haya Hospital. Introduction. The treatment of malignant glioma consists in complete surgery or broadest possible, followed by radiation on the previous location of the removed tumor and, in many cases, with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy. These tumors have a high recurrence rate despite receiving appropriate treatment, being proportional to histologic grade. Once you see a recurrence, reoperation and change line chemotherapy are usual. Due to the advancement of radiosurgery techniques and greater availability, is being increasingly used for the treatment of small size recurrence, or to treat some rest after surgery. Objective. Descriptive study of patients suffering from malignant gliomas treated with radiosurgery in the Carlos Haya Hospital. Material and methods. Since the implementation of the technique of radiosurgery in the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga in 2010, 9 patients were treated with brain gliomas with Brainlab radiosurgery system. The prescribed dose ranged from 16 to 22 Gy, depending on the size of the treated lesion in each case and the dose of radiation that had previously received. Results. Of the 9 patients, 5 were men and 4 women. The most common first symptom was seizures in 5 patients. The distribution of patients according to histology was as follows: 5 glioblastoma multiforme, 2 oligodendrogliomas, 1 ependymoma and 1 astrocytoma grade II. Conclusions.

1157,"Clinical significance of downstaging in patients with limited-disease small-cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of downstaging on OS in LD-SCLC patients treated with first-line treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 210 LD-SCLC patients who were treated with first-line treatment at Seoul National University Hospital between April 1999 and November 2012. Compared with initial tumor, node, metastases (TNM) stage, cases that showed a lower TNM stage after treatment were defined as 'downstaging.' The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and a subgroup analysis on the responders was performed.RESULTS: After first-line treatment, 78 (37.1%) patients achieved complete response, 97 (46.2%) achieved PR, and 35 (16.7%) experienced stable disease or progressive disease. A hundred and fifty one patients (71.9%) showed downstaging of their diseases, and the remaining 59 patients (28.1%) showed no change or upstaging. The median OS for patients achieving downstaging and no change/upstaging were 32.8 months and 13.1 months, respectively (P < .001). Of the 97 patients who achieved PR, the OS was significantly longer in patients who showed downstaging than those who did not (25.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively; P = .004). In multivariate analyses, female sex, downstaging, lower initial TNM stage, and prophylactic cranial irradiation were independent good prognostic factors for OS.CONCLUSION: Downstaging might be an independent good prognostic factor in LD-SCLC. Specifically, downstaging is expected to be useful for stratification of patients achieving PR. Further prospective studies are warranted to verify whether patients who achieved PR without downstaging can be candidates for consolidation treatments after first-line treatment.",Excluded

1225,"[Radiation-induced neuropathies: collateral damage of improved cancer prognosis]. INTRODUCTION: Because of the improvement of cancer prognosis, long-term damages of treatments become a medical and public health problem. Among the iatrogenic complications, neurological impairment is crucial to consider since motor disability and pain have a considerable impact on quality of life of long cancer survivors. However, radiation-induced neuropathies have not been the focus of great attention. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated review about the radiation-induced lesions of the peripheral nerve system.STATE OF THE ART: Radiation-induced neuropathies are characterized by their heterogeneity in both symptoms and disease course. Signs and symptoms depend on the affected structures of the peripheral nerve system (nerve roots, nerve plexus or nerve trunks). Early-onset complications are often transient and late complications are usually progressive and associated with a poor prognosis. The most frequent and well known is delayed radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, which may follow breast cancer irradiation. Radiation-induced lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy is characterized by pure or predominant lower motor neuron signs. They can be misdiagnosed, confused with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or with leptomeningeal metastases since nodular MRI enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content can be observed. In the absence of specific markers of the link with radiotherapy, the diagnosis of post-radiation neuropathy may be difficult. Recently, a posteriori conformal radiotherapy with 3D dosimetric reconstitution has been developed to link a precise anatomical site to unexpected excess irradiation.PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION: The importance of early diagnosis of radiation-induced neuropathies is underscored by the emergence of new disease-modifying treatments. Although the pathophysiology is not fully understood, it is already possible to target radiation-induced fibrosis but also associated factors such as ischemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. A phase III trial evaluating the association of pentoxifylline, tocopherol and clodronate (PENTOCLO, NCT01291433) in radiation-induced neuropathies is now recruiting.",Excluded

Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT): SIRT, or radioembolization, delivers yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres via a catheter in the hepatic artery to treat intra-hepatic disease. SIRT takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply for much of the normal liver parenchyma arrives through the portal circulation, while tumors are preferentially fed by the arterial system. Glass- or resin-based microspheres tagged with Y-90 are delivered typically in a ""lobar"" fashion and preferentially distribute into the tumoral and peritumoral vasculature, thereby delivering a high radiation dose (>100 Gy). Because Y-90 is a beta emitter, the effect is relatively selective and mostly affects only the metastatic sites while sparing normal liver parenchyma. The two currently available Y-90 products include SIR-spheres and TheraSphere. SIR-spheres deliver a higher dose per treatment and are more embolic. In contrast, the TheraSphere product delivers a higher specific radioactivity dose per microsphere allowing for smaller dose per treatment and are not as embolic. Both products have been shown to be welltolerated.

Purpose: Augmented reality (AR) holds great potential for IR by integrating virtual 3D anatomic models into the real world.1 In this pilot study, we developed an AR guidance system for cerebral angiography, evaluated its impact on radiation, contrast, and fluoroscopy time, and assessed physician response. Materials: In this prospective study, 9 patients with CT or MR imaging of the aorta underwent diagnostic neuroangiography with AR guidance from June to August 2017. Before each procedure, segmentation software was used to create a 3D model of the patient's aortic arch including carotid and vertebral arteries. The model was deployed to HoloLens (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), a stereoscopic optical see-Through AR head-worn display. Using the AR user interface we developed, physicians manipulated a virtual 3D model intraoperatively via voice commands, gaze, and gestures while maintaining sterility. In total, 6 physicians completed 14 postoperative questionnaires assessing the system. 18 casematched retrospective controls were identified by screening for age, aorta imaging, cone-beam CT, indication, physician, and OR.

A series of monomeric porphyrins (2-8) based on porphyrin C (1) have been tested as sensitisers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cerebral glioma using the in vitro/in vivo C6 intracerebral animal tumour model. The in vivo screening, consisting of cytotoxicity, phototoxicity (red light) and subcellular localisation studies, revealed two sensitisers (porphyrin 7, molecular weight 863 Da and porphyrin 8, molecular weight 889 Da), which had greater photoactivity than porphyrin C and similar photoactivity to haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) although at a 5-fold higher dose than HpD. Both sensitisers showed intracellular localisation to discrete organelle sites and exhibited considerably less 'dark' cytotoxicity than HpD. The kinetics of uptake of porphyrins 7 and 8 was studied in the mouse C6 glioma model as well as in biopsy samples from normal brain, liver, spleen and blood. Maximal drug uptake levels in tumour occurred 9 and 6 h after intraperitoneal injection for 7 and 8 respectively, at which time the tumour to normal brain ratios were 15:1 and 13:1 respectively.

Introduction: By medio 2012 Rigshospitalet has treated more than 60 patients with neuroendocrine tumors with 177Lu-Dotatate. Patients are scheduled for 4 treatments with 8-10 weeks in between. Cells in the red bone marrow are vulnerable to radiation and are together with the kidneys the organs at risk in patients undergoing 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. The effective dose given to the red bone marrow can be estimated from the calculated accumulated radioactivity in the blood. Aim(s): To described the procedure for collection of blood samples, measurement of radioactivity in the blood and for estimating the effective dose to bone marrow following 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. Method(s): At the first treatment a total of eight blood samples is collected at the following time points: 45, 90, 150 and 210 minutes, 8 and 24 hours, and 4 and 7 days after the administration of 177Lu-Dotatate. For the following three treatments no blood samples are collected at day 4 and 7, resulting in a total of six samples. The first four blood samples are drawn from a venflon or venipuncture in the opposite arm of the infusion of the radionuclide in order to avoid contamination of the samples. The exact time of sampling is recorded for all blood samples. The activity of Lu-177 in the blood is so high shortly after administration that even small sample volumes causes lack of accuracy due to the dead time of the counting apparatus. Therefore samples are stored for seven days before they are prepared for counting. Measurements during the development of the data collection procedure showed that the radioactivity was at least 1.5 greater in whole blood than in plasma. Measurement of radioactivity is therefore done on whole blood from which samples of 500 muL blood is taken. The amount of Lu-177 in the 500 muL blood samples (duplicate samples for every time point) is measured in a well counter (Canberra Cobra-II auto-gamma) using a 15-400 keV window and a counting time of 10 min which is sufficient for good count statistics. Based on the measured cpm/sample the Lu-177 concentration in the blood (Bq/ml) is calculated for every time point and the result are plotted in a time-activity graph.

Electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal (GP) nerve (which innervates taste buds on the caudal 1/3 of the tongue) were recorded from single cells in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation was delivered as single pulses (n=55), paired-pulses (n=15) and tetanic trains (n=11). NTS cells with GP-evoked responses were also tested for responsivity to taste stimuli (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M quinine HCl). Fifty-five neurons were studied: 49 cells showed GP-evoked (mean latency+/-SEM=18.0+/-1.32 ms); seven of these were taste-responsive. Spontaneous rate of these cells was low (mean+/-SEM=1.4+/-0.3 spikes per second; median=0.21 spikes per second) and many cells showed no spontaneous activity. Paired-pulse stimulation of the GP nerve in 13 rats produced both paired-pulse suppression (n=11) and paired-pulse enhancement (n=4); tetanic stimulation (25 Hz, 1.0 s) produced sustained (>20 s) increases or decreases in firing rate in 7 of 11 cells tested. Histological data suggested that GP-evoked responses recorded in the most rostral NTS were likely the result of polysynaptic connections. Cells with GP-evoked responses formed a heterogeneous group in terms of their response properties and differed from cells with evoked responses to chorda tympani (CT; which innervates taste buds on the rostral 1/3 of the tongue) nerve stimulation. These differences may reflect the respective functional specializations of the GP and CT nerves.",Excluded
1737,"Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and structural chromosome aberration in mutagenicity testing. Data from previous studies published on the induction by mutagens of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and structural chromosome damage were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Although a good correlation between the incidence of both cytogenetic phenomena has been pointed out in many previous publications, about 30% of the agents for which comparable data were available yielded non-corresponding qualitative results concerning both indicator effects. However, even in groups with good qualitative agreement distinct quantitative differences indicated different molecular mechanisms of the formation of SCEs and breaks. Additional information supporting the importance of these differences for the validity of both indicator systems has been derived from the results obtained using strong clastogens exhibiting a low or no SCE-inducing activity and vice versa, from special observations on chromosomal breakage syndromes, and from studies on the action of known co- and anti-clastogens on SCE-induction by chemical mutagens. As a result, it has been suggested that the SCE-technique should be considered as a valuable additional method for cytogenetic mutagenicity testing, which, however, is not adequate to replace the classical methods of analysis of structural chromosome damage.

1201,"STAT RAD: Prospective Dose Escalation Clinical Trial of Single Fraction Scan-Plan-QA-Treat Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Painful Osseous Metastases. PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is a well-established treatment for symptomatic bone metastases. Despite continued advances in both planning techniques and treatment delivery, the standard workflow has remained relatively unchanged, often requiring 1 to 3 weeks and resulting in patient inconvenience and delayed palliation. We developed an expedited method wherein computed tomography simulation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery are performed in 1 day. This prospective pilot clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and patient satisfaction of this rapid workflow.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with 1 to 3 painful bone metastases were prospectively enrolled and treated with 1 fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, using a same-day Scan-Plan-QA-Treat workflow, termed STAT RAD, in a phase 1/2 dose escalation trial from 8 Gy to 15 Gy per fraction. Bone pain, opioid use, patient satisfaction, performance status, and quality of life were evaluated before and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after treatment. Outcomes and treatment-related toxicity were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were enrolled, and 46 patients with 60 bone metastases were treated per the protocol. Partial or greater pain response occurred in 50% of patients at 1 week, 75% of patients at 8 weeks, 68.7% of patients at 6 months, and 33.3% of patients at 12 months. There were 2 grade-3 toxicities, including 1 spinal fracture associated with disease progression and hyperbilirubinemia. Reirradiation was required in 16.7% of treated lesions at a median time to retreatment of 4.9 months. Most patient responses (78.6%) indicated that patients would choose this workflow again.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that treating bone metastases with palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy via a single-fraction, patient-centric workflow is feasible and safe with doses up to 15 Gy. However, pain response decreased at 12 months and was associated with a 16.7% retreatment rate, which suggests that further dose escalation is warranted.",Excluded

1611,"The coupling between synaptic vesicles and Ca2+ channels determines fast neurotransmitter release. In order to release neurotransmitter synchronously in response to a presynaptic action potential, synaptic vesicles must be both release competent and located close to presynaptic Ca2+ channels. It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse. We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials.",Excluded
2059,"Development of radiolabeled molecular imaging probes for in vivo analysis of biological function. [Japanese]. Molecular imaging is a newly emerging field aimed at advancing our understanding of biology and medicine through the noninvasive in vivo investigation of cellular molecular events involved in normal and pathologic processes. In this field, researchers and/or clinicians are combining modern tools of molecular and cell biology with state of the art technology in order to noninvasively image living subjects. Various imaging modalities such as optics (fluorescence and luminescence), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and radiation are being used to visually capture and study molecular and cellular events in living organisms. Among these modalities, nuclear medical molecular imaging uses radionuclides [i.e., positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)], and has characteristic properties that allow researchers and/or clinicians to obtain functional images of living subjects with high sensitivity. Translational molecular imaging, a research step between animal experiments and the clinical setting, has been successful when using nuclear medical molecular imaging. This approach leads to better methods for studying biological processes, as well as for diagnosing and managing diseases. In this review, two topics associated with our research on nuclear medical molecular imaging are summarized: (1) the development of a nuclear medical molecular imaging probe that targets cerebral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and the translational molecular imaging research conducted using this nAChR imaging probe; and (2) the development of oxygen-dependent degradable nuclear medical molecular imaging probes that target hypoxia-inducible factor-1-active tumor microenvironments.

482,"Selective nanoparticle-directed ablation of the canine prostate. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer type and the second most common cause of cancer death among US men. This study, adapted a previously reported nanoparticle-directed photothermal treatment of brain tumors to the treatment of prostate disease by using normal canine prostate in vivo, directly injected with a suspension of nanoparticles as a proxy for prostate tumor, and by developing laser dosimetry for prostate which is marginally ablative in native tissue, yet producing photothermal coagulation in prostate tissue containing nanoparticles.METHODS: Canine prostates were exposed by surgical laparotomy and directly injected with suspensions of nanoparticles (nanoshells) and irradiated by a NIR laser source delivered percutaneously by an optical fiber catheter and isotropic diffuser. The photothermal lesions were permitted to resolve for up to 8 days, at which time each animal was euthanized, necropsied, and the prostate taken for histopathological and elemental analysis.RESULTS: Nanoparticles were retained for up to 4 hours in prostate and served as a proxy for prostate tumor. A marginally ablative laser dose of 3.0 W for 3 minutes was developed which would yield 4 mm-radius coagulo-necrotic lesions if nanoparticles were present.CONCLUSION: We have shown that the addition of nanoshells to native tissue, combined with a marginally ablative laser dose can generate ablative thermal lesions, and that the radial extent of the thermal lesions is strictly confined to within ~4 mm of the optical fiber with sub-millimeter uncertainty. This, in turn, suggests a means of precise tumor ablation with an ability to obviate damage to critical structures limited primarily by the precision with which the optical fiber applicator can be placed. In so doing, it should be possible to realize a precise, nerve bundle and urethra sparing prostate cancer treatment using a minimally invasive, percutaneous approach.",Excluded
735,"Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for unilateral thalamotomy in medication refractory essential tremor. Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and is associated with significant functional impairment and disability. Ablative and stimulation-based surgical treatments have been developed to treat the significant number of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management. Although often providing effective tremor control, current surgical options have risks associated with intracranial procedures, as well as issues of durability and predictability of treatment response. Here, we explore the application of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as an alternative, non-invasive means of generating thalamic lesions in patients with treatment-resistant ET. Method(s): Four patients underwent awake MRgFUS thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor (mean age 70.8; mean duration of illness 17.8 years). Diagnosis of refractory ET was confirmed by a movement disorder neurologist, and patients underwent baseline medical and imaging investigations prior to treatment. Tremor assessments and serial structural imaging were performed at 1, 7, 30 and 90 days following the procedure. Result(s): All four patients experienced immediate and sustained improvements in their dominant (treated) hand tremor (Figure 1). At 1- and 3-months following treatment, dominant hand tremor scores were reduced by a mean of 89% and 78%, respectively, on part A of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Functional impairment decreased significantly at 3-months, with patients reporting improvements in writing, drinking and eating. There were no serious adverse events, with only one patient reporting persistent lip and finger paraesthesias at 3-months. Conclusion(s): MRgFUS appears to be a safe and effective means of non-invasively generating thalamic lesions for the relief of refractory ET. This technology is a promising alternative to radiation- and surgical-based approaches to lesional functional neurosurgery, but requires larger trials with more patients to verify its efficacy.

2186,"Hedgehog signaling sensitizes glioma stem cells to endogenous nano-irradiation. Objectives Existence of therapy resistant glioma stem cells (GSC) is responsible for the high recurrence rate and incurability of glioblastomas. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity plays an essential role for self-renewal capacity and survival of GSC. Since these cells are supposed to be the source of tumor recurrence, a new paradigm targeting high resistant dormant GSC may provide a novel therapeutic model for malignant brain cancers. Thus, we examined the potential of the Sonic Hh ligand for sensitizing of GSC to endogenous nanoirradiation. Methods Primary GM cells were phenotyped using GSC markers by microscopy. GSC were isolated using CD133 microbeads. Existence and activity of Hh pathway was examined by SDS-PAGE and RT-PCR. For stimulation, GM cells and normal human astrocytes (NHA) were incubated with Shh (200 ng/ml for 5d) and with fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd, 1muM for 1h). Proliferation was determined by BrdU. Annexin-V visualized the apoptosis. Uptake and DNA incorporation of I-125-ITdU (250kBq/1*10^5 cells) were measured after 4d using gamma-counter. Killing efficiency was defined by means of intrinsic caspases activation and clonogenic survival. Results Sonic Hh ligand preferentially and efficiently activated GSC to enter the radiation sensitive G2/M phase. Concomitant inhibition with FdUrd and treatment with the Auger electron emitting thymidine analogue [I-125]ITdU led to fatal nano-irradiation in sensitized GCS. Targeting of proliferating GCS with DNA-incorporated [I-125]ITdU efficiently invoked the intrinsic apoptotic pathway despite active DNA repair mechanisms. Further, [I-125]ITdU completely inhibited survival of GCS. Analysis of non-stem glioblastoma cells and NHA revealed that GCS differentially responded to Sonic Hh ligand. Conclusions These data demonstrate a highly efficient and controllable singlecell kill therapeutic model for targeting glioma stem cells.",Excluded
886,"How the use of CBCT and MRI has changed our management of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma remains a clinical diagnosis but today imaging has become an important cornerstone in the diagnostic work-up of this condition. Conebeam CT offers a much higher resolution of the interface between bone, air and soft tissue, while the associated irradiation dose is substantially lower, as compared to multi-detector CT scans. As such, CBCT has become very useful for the pre-op work-up of patients with cholesteatoma showing with precision bony erosion of the ossicular chain and erosion of the petrous bone (as fistulae, perilabyrinthine erosion, intracranial invasion). Also the aeration of theME-cleft is shown (important for the functional prognosis) and important preoperative landmarks warn the surgeon for eventual pitfalls. The advent of the non-EP diffusion weighted sequence in MR-imaging makes this sequence a very useful adjunctive tool in the pre-op work-up of cholesteatoma cases specially in cases suspected of intralabyrinthine spread, or extension medial to the otic capsule or intracranial invasion. Its today almost undisputed value has been demonstrated in the postoperative follow-up of cholesteatoma by the high sensitivity and specificity (in most studies well above 90%). By this innovation many ""unnecessary"" (because absence of residual pathology) second stage operations can today be avoided.

2140,"Cholinergic responses in crossed tecto-reticular neurons of rat superior colliculus. Neurons in the intermediate gray layer (SGI) of mammalian superior colliculus (SC) receive cholinergic innervation from the brain stem parabrachial region, which seems to modulate the signal processing in the SC. To clarify its role particularly in orienting behaviors, we studied cholinergic effects on the major output neuron group of the SGI, crossed tecto-reticular neurons (cTRNs), identified by retrograde labeling from the contralateral brain stem gaze center in SC slices obtained from rats (PND 17-22) by whole cell patch-clamp techniques. Bath application of carbachol induced either 1) nicotinic inward (nIN) + muscarinic inward (mIN) (11/24) or 2) nIN + mIN + muscarinic outward (mOUT) (13/24) current responses. Transient pressure application of 1 mM acetylcholine elicited nIN in all neurons tested (n = 58). In a majority of these neurons (52/58), the nIN was completely suppressed by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, a specific antagonist for alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype. The remaining 6/58 neurons exhibited not only the slower alpha4beta2 receptor-mediated component but also a faster component that was inhibited by a specific antagonist for alpha7 nicotinic receptor, alpha-bungarotoxin. cTRNs expressing alpha7 nicotinic receptors tended to be smaller in size than those lacking alpha7 receptors. Bath application of muscarine induced two response patterns: mIN only (17/38) and mIN+ mOUT (21/38). The mIN and mOUT were mediated by M3 (plus M1) and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively. These results suggest that a major response to cholinergic inputs to cTRNs is excitatory.

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is the single most effective therapy for malignant gliomas. Targeting the CD95 apoptotic pathway is a promising experimental approach to these neoplasms. Here, we asked whether irradiation modulates CD95-mediated apoptosis of human malignant glioma cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: LN-18, LN-229 and T98G human malignant glioma cell lines were irradiated with dosages from 0-8 Gy and treated with CD95L (CD95 ligand). CD95 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was determined by DEVD cleavage. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by crystal violet staining of cells in a 96-well plate assay. Clonogenic cell death was determined by a standard colony forming assay.RESULTS: We find that (i) CD95L-induced apoptosis, but not irradiation-induced clonogenic cell death, involves caspase 3 activation and is blocked by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A. (ii) Irradiation does not modulate CD95 expression either in p53 wild-type or in p53 mutant glioma cell lines, and does not enhance CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity or CD95L-induced clonogenic cell death.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous CD95/CD95L interactions are not involved in radiation-induced clonogenic cell death and that the killing cascades of CD95L and irradiation are independent in human malignant glioma cells.",Excluded

AIM: Primary hypothyroidism is one of the late complications that can occur after radiation therapy for malignant tumors in the head and neck region. The aim of this retrospective study was to show the validity of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication model for thyroid gland based on clinical results.METHODS: Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine serum levels before radiation therapy, 3 months after the beginning of radiation therapy, and afterwards at each follow-up visit. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Dose-volume histogram, total dose, fractionation schedule, total duration of the treatment, and other parameters were used for normal tissue complication probability calculation based on the LKB model. The model was evaluated after fitting with the three sets of parameters for grade 2 hypothyroidism: 1) ""Emami,"" where n= 0.22; m= 0.26, and D<sub>50</sub>= 80Gy; 2) ""mean dose,"" where n= 1; m= 0.27, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy; and 3) ""Lyman EUD,"" where n= 0.49; m= 0.24, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy.

Data suggesting cerebral involvement in NMOSD is scarce. Here, we investigate brain parenchymal integrity alterations in NMOSD and their association with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) thinning. Method(s): 21 patients with NMOSD and 21 sex and age matched healthy control (HC) subjects were enrolled.

Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study.

2793,"The effect of biological effective dose on time to symptom progression in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. AIMS: Renal cell carcinoma is commonly thought to be a radioresistant malignancy. Retrospective studies report conflicting results on the effect of radiotherapy dose escalation on response and time to progression in symptomatic metastatic disease; studies using the linear quadratic model have used alpha/beta ratios that are inappropriate for slow growing tumours. We aim to describe our experience with palliative radiotherapy in this context, relating Biological Effective Dose to outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 1995 to April 2001, 143 independent palliative radiotherapy treatments were delivered to 78 patients in a single institution. Retrospective data was obtained on the radiotherapy schedule used, symptom response and time to symptom progression. The biological effective dose (BED) was calculated using alpha/beta ratios of 3 and 7 Gy (BED3 and BED7). The Log-Rank test was used to assess any differences in time to progression, and the Cox Proportional Hazards analysis to determine prognostic factors of time to progression.RESULTS: Overall symptomatic response rate was 73%, with most responses being partial (67%). Forty-three (38%) patients had symptomatic progression after a median follow-up of 425 days. BED (BED3 or BED7) was not significantly different across response types (complete, partial or no response; P=0.90 and 0.88, respectively) and was not predictive for time to symptomatic progression (P=0.99 for BED3 and P=0.70 for BED7). Patients with bone metastases received less total dose (P=0.001), less BED (BED3, P=0.0013, and BED7, P=0.0005) and had a significantly longer time to progression than other sites of metastases (hazard ratio (HR) 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7; P=0.004). Initial treatment with interferon-alpha alone in patients presenting with metastatic disease, before palliative radiotherapy, was also associated with a shorter time to symptom progression (HR 4.6; 95% CI 1.5-14.1; P=0.007). On removal of these criteria, brain metastases became a significant predictor of progression time, with an HR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.0-5.9; P=0.05), showing an increased risk of progression with brain metastases compared with metastases elsewhere. Time from primary diagnosis to development of metastatic disease was not predictive of time to symptom progression (P=0.29).CONCLUSION: Despite the widespread assumption that renal cell carcinoma is radioresistant, retrospective assessment showed high response rates to palliative radiotherapy. On the basis of our data, higher BED does not seem to be a predictor of response or of duration of response in the palliative treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Palliation of bone pain seems to be particularly durable compared with the palliation of symptoms at other sites of metastases. A trend for shorter duration of palliative effect of whole-brain radiotherapy was noted.",Excluded

1596,"A prospective phase II trial of lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( LEN-DEX) in POEMS syndrome. Background. POEMS syndrome is a rare form of B cell dyscrasia combining a proliferation usually of plasma cells, a polyneuropathy, osteocondensing bone lesions and multiple other clinical signs. The pathogenesis is not well understood but VEGF plays a major role. In patients with one or two sclerotic plasmacytoma and no bone marrow involvement, first line therapy should include radiation. For patients with diffuse sclerotic lesions, bone marrow involvement or absence of any bone lesion and for those who have not demonstrated stabilization of their disease 3 to 6 months after completing radiation systemic therapy is indicated, the most effective being high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Radiation of a single lesion is effective in about every other case and is accompanied by a fairly slow improvement of the neurological symptoms, often after initial worsening. ASCT seems to be accompanied by a number of important complications, in particular engraftment syndrome. Outside these 2 treatments there is no consensus therapy. Lenalidomide (LEN), a drug without serious neurological toxicity, has the advantage of being both anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic to malignant plasma cells (Richardson PG, Blood 2002;100(9):3063-7). We have recently reported a series of 20 French patients with POEMS syndrome treated by LEN with a good efficacy. We now report the first 27 patients of a prospective phase II trial using LEN + dexamethasone (LEN-DEX), 2 cycles preceding radiation or high dose treatment trying to obtain a rapid clinical response and to avoid engraftment syndrome or 9 cycles followed by 1 year LENalone in patients who cannot receive radiation or ASCT.

Patients who can be treated by local radiation or intensive treatment with stem cell support receive two 28 day cycles of LEN 25 mg PO Days 1-21 and DEX 40 mg PO Days 1,8,15,22 before radiation or intensive treatment (Group 1), the other patients receive 9 cycles of the same LEN-DEX (Group 2) and then 12 cycles of continuous low dose LEN (10 mg). LEN dose was tapered to 10 mg for patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min and DEX to 20 mg for patients above 75 years of age and for those who were frail patients. Main eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome according to criteria by Dispenzieri et al (Am J Hematol 2012;87(8):804-14), an age of 18 or more, a creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min, no prior treatment with or contraindication to LEN and no uncontrolled thrombosis. Serum and plasma VEGF, serum electrophoresis, immunofixation and free light chain measurements were centrally monitored. Neurologic evaluations were performed using the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS), the Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) and the 10 meter walk test (10MWT). The primary endpoint was evaluation of the effectiveness of LEN-DEX combination using biological responses (decrease of monoclonal protein and serum VEGF level) and secondary endpoints were clinical and particularly neurological responses. Results. Twenty-seven patients have been included in 12 centres, median age was 61 (range 32-75), the median follow-up was 6.6 months (range 2-24). Eighteen patients were in group 1, with radiotherapy in 10 patients and ASCT in 8 patients; 9 patients were in group 2. Nineteen patients were in first line and 8 already treated. Only 2 patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events due to LEN (cytopenia) and 2 patients had allergic rashes, no thrombotic event occurred. No engraftment syndrome was noted in the 5 patients already treated with ASCT. To date, no patient have died. Evolution of VEGF median values in serum and plasma, M-spike and dFLC levels and evolution of neurological measurements are reported in table 1. Neurological improvement was very rapid in some patients, using ONLS and 10MWT 11/18 evaluable patients had a neurological improvement after 2 cycles with an improvement of 1 or more of the ONLS score an /or change of 0.1 m/s or more in the 10MWT. Only one patient who progressed after nine cycles received another therapy. Conclusion. This is the first prospective trial of LEN-DEX in POEMS syndrome. This combination seems well tolerated in this disease with a good efficacy on VEGF measurements and rapid neurological improvement in the majority of patients. Updated data will be presented at the meeting. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1289,"Nerve specific modulation of somatosensory inflow to cerebral cortex during submaximal sustained contraction in first dorsal interosseous muscle. Modulation of the early component (latency approximately 20-30 ms) of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and that of the middle and long latency cutaneous reflexes was examined in 13 healthy volunteers during fatiguing submaximal voluntary contraction (20% maximum) of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). The SEP was evoked by stimulating the ulnar nerve (U-SEP), a mixed nerve innervating the FDI muscle, the purely cutaneous nerves of the 2nd digit (D2-SEP) and the 5th digit (D5-SEP). The cutaneous reflex was recorded concurrently with D2-SEP. The size of D2- and D5-SEP significantly decreased during fatiguing contraction as compared to rest, and the decrease in both SEPs persisted throughout fatiguing contraction. In contrast, the significant decrease in the gating of U-SEP disappeared during the latter phase of fatiguing contraction. The ratio (reflex response/background EMG) of excitatory E2 (latency approximately 60-90 ms) and E3 (approximately 120-180 ms) responses following D2 stimulation significantly increased during the middle or latter phase of fatiguing contraction. In contrast, no significant changes in inhibitory I1 and I2 were seen. The release of the attenuation of U-SEP and a constant gating of the D2- and D5-SEP suggests that the brain selectively permits the muscular afferent inflow into the cortex during fatiguing contraction. An increase in the E2 and E3 reflex ratio of cutaneous reflexes during the later phase of fatiguing contraction most likely results from an increase in the excitability of the motor cortex.",Excluded

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity.",Excluded

Previous studies have revealed that extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) exposure affects neuronal dendritic spine density and NMDAR and AMPAR subunit expressions in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Although calcium signaling has a critical role in control of EC neuronal functions, however, it is still unclear whether the ELF-EMF exposure affects the EC neuronal calcium homeostasis. In the present study, using whole-cell recording and calcium imaging, we record the whole-cell inward currents that contain the voltage-gated calcium currents and show that ELF-EMF (50Hz, 1mT or 3mT, lasting 24h) exposure does not influence these currents. Next, we specifically isolate the high-voltage activated (HVA) and low-voltage activated (LVA) calcium channels-induced currents. Similarly, the activation and inactivation characteristics of these membrane calcium channels are also not influenced by ELF-EMF. Importantly, ELF-EMF exposure reduces the maximum amplitude of the high-K(+)-evoked calcium elevation in EC neurons, which is abolished by thapsigargin, a Ca(2+) ATPase inhibitor, to empty the intracellular calcium stores of EC neurons. Together, these findings indicate that ELF-EMF exposure specifically influences the intracellular calcium dynamics of cultural EC neurons via a calcium channel-independent mechanism.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical benefit of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in patients suffering from radiotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy.DESIGN: Retrospective review of a single institutional experience.PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with the postradiotherapy syndrome received ventriculoperitoneal shunts. All had a history of cranial irradiation, progressive ventriculomegaly visible on neuroimaging scans, and neurologic decline; other causes of hydrocephalus were excluded. All 31 patients had cognitive deficits: 30 had gait disturbance and 24 were incontinent.RESULTS: Twenty-four (80%) of 30 assessable patients achieved symptomatic improvement an average of 1.6 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Incontinence and gait problems were more likely to improve than cognition. Sixteen (53%) of 30 patients achieved a good overall functional outcome, and incontinence was the only feature significantly associated with good outcome (P=.04). Neither cerebrospinal fluid-opening pressure nor tap tests predicted improvement from ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Median duration of improvement was 6 months, and median survival after receiving the shunt was 14.5 months. Shunt-related complications occurred in 10 (33%) of 30 patients, with 1 fatal outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Our results from ventriculoperitoneal shunting in selected patients with radiation-induced hydrocephalus suggest potential benefit. Improvement is incomplete and temporary, but can improve quality of life. Reliable predictors of successful shunt outcome were not identified.",Excluded

This study evaluated the potential of iron oxide nanoparticle-loaded human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived spherical neural masses (SNMs) to improve the transportation of stem cells to the brain, ameliorate brain damage from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and recover the functional status after ICH under an external magnetic field of a magnet attached to a helmet. At 24 h after induction of ICH, rats were randomly separated into three experimental groups: ICH with injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS group), ICH with intravenous injection of magnetosome-like ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes (FION)-labeled SNMs (SNMs* group), and ICH with intravenous injection of FION-labeled SNMs followed by three days of external magnetic field exposure for targeted delivery by a magnet-embedded helmet (SNMs*+Helmet group). On day 3 after ICH induction, an increased Prussian blue-stained area and decreased swelling volume were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the other groups. A significantly decreased recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by improved neurological function three days after ICH were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group. Hemispheric atrophy at six weeks after ICH was significantly decreased in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the PBS group. In conclusion, we have developed a targeted delivery system using FION tagged to stem cells and a magnet-embedded helmet. The targeted delivery of SNMs might have the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ICH.",Excluded

Background: The phase III ALEX study in patients with treatment-naive advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met its primary end point of improved progression-free survival (PFS) with alectinib versus crizotinib. Here, we present detailed central nervous system (CNS) efficacy data from ALEX.Patients and methods: Overall, 303 patients aged >=18 years underwent 1:1 randomization to receive twice-daily doses of alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg. Brain imaging was conducted in all patients at baseline and every subsequent 8 weeks. End points (analyzed by subgroup: patients with/without baseline CNS metastases; patients with/without prior radiotherapy) included PFS, CNS objective response rate (ORR), and time to CNS progression.Results: In total, 122 patients had Independent Review Committee-assessed baseline CNS metastases (alectinib, n = 64; crizotinib, n = 58), 43 had measurable lesions (alectinib, n = 21; crizotinib, n = 22), and 46 had received prior radiotherapy (alectinib, n = 25; crizotinib, n = 21). Investigator-assessed PFS with alectinib was consistent between patients with baseline CNS metastases [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.64] and those without (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80, P interaction = 0.36). Similar results were seen in patients regardless of prior radiotherapy. Time to CNS progression was significantly longer with alectinib versus crizotinib and comparable between patients with and without baseline CNS metastases (P < 0.0001).

Radiation therapy for patients with head and neck malignancies frequently results in painful mucositis, which is usually poorly controlled with standard analgesics or topical anesthetics. To better understand the temporal development of radiation-induced pain and the effects of this pain on activities of daily living, 14 patients undergoing radiation therapy for a newly diagnosed head and neck malignancy completed daily pain diaries during the course of irradiation. All patients developed painful mucositis, usually beginning during the second or third week of radiation. Despite the use of analgesics/anesthetics, pain was rated as moderate or severe on 37% of treatment days and was noted to be constant or present throughout most of the day on 58% of treatment days. Eating and sleep disturbances related to pain occurred on 55% and 34% of treatment days, respectively. Eight patients had greater than a 2-kg weight loss.

731,"Irradiation of 850-nm laser light changes the neural activities in rat primary visual cortex. Although infrared laser was proven to be an alternative approach for neural stimulation, there is very little known about the neural response to infrared laser irradiation in visual cortex. This study is to investigate the effect of near-infrared laser irradiation on neural activities at the cortex level. A 850-nm pigtailed diode laser was applied to stimulate the rat primary visual cortex while the horizontal black and white stripe pattern was used as standard visual stimulation to evoke visual-evoked potential (VEP). Both amplitude and latency of VEP P100 was measured with or without infrared pulse stimulation applied in rat primary visual cortex. Paired t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate the impact of infrared irradiation and its pulse width on the amplitudes and latencies of P100, respectively. The results from our preliminary study revealed that, the pulsed near-infrared laser depressed the VEP amplitude and shortened the latency of P100; with the increment of pulse width of infrared irradiation, further decline of VEP amplitude and much shortened latency of P100 were observed. The present work suggests that near-infrared laser irradiation can alter the neural activities in primary visual cortex transiently, and could provide a novel contactless artificial neural stimulus to brain cortex with high spatial selectivity.",Excluded

This work also reveals the aspects of electromagnetic radiation on the cell body. The bright images of the hippocampal CA3 region of the rat brain under the resolution of 60 x objective are used to analyze the effects called NISSL-stained dataset. The proposed non-linear segmentation model segments the foreground cells from the cell images based on the linear regression analysis. These foreground cells further get discriminated as live/dead cells and quantified using shape descriptors and geometric method, respectively. The proposed segmentation model is showing promising results (accuracy, 82.82%) in comparison with the existing renowned approaches. The counting analysis of live and dead cells using the proposed method is far better than the manual counts. Therefore, the proposed segmentation model and quantifying procedure is an amalgamated method for cell quantification that yields better segmentation results and provides pithy insights into the analysis of neuronal anomalies at a microscopic level.

1200,"Alterations in uptake and release rates for GABA, glutamate, and glutamine during biochemical maturation of highly purified cultures of cerebral cortical neurons, a GABAergic preparation. This study demonstrates that virtually homogenous cultures of mouse cerebral neurons, obtained from 15-day-old embryos, differentiate at least as well as cultures which in addition contain astrocytes. This was indicated by glutamate decarboxylase activity which within 2 weeks rose from a negligible value to twice the level in the adult mouse cerebral cortex, and by a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake rate which quadrupled during the second week in culture and reached higher values than in brain slices. Within the same period, the GABA content increased four to five times to 75 nmol/mg protein, and a potassium-induced increase in [<sup>14</sup>C]GABA efflux became apparent. Although the development was faster than in vivo, optimum differentiation required maintenance of the cultures beyong the age of 1 week. Uptake and release rates for glutamate and glutamine underwent much less developmental alteration. At no time was there any potassium-induced release of radioactivity after exposure to [<sup>14</sup>C]glutamate, and the glutamate uptake was only slightly increased during the period of GABAergic development. This indicates that exogenous glutamate is not an important GABA precursor.

683,"Effect of Neoadjuvant Therapy and Rectal Surgery on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Rectal Cancer During the First 2 Years After Diagnosis. INTRODUCTION: Rectal cancer surgery with neoadjuvant therapy is associated with substantial morbidity. The present study describes the course of quality of life (QOL) in rectal cancer patients in the first 2 years after the start of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study within a colorectal cancer cohort including rectal cancer patients who were referred for neoadjuvant chemoradiation or short-course radiotherapy and underwent rectal surgery. QOL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and colorectal cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR29) before treatment and after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The outcomes were compared with the QOL scores from the Dutch general population and stratified by low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection. Postoperative bowel dysfunction after low anterior resection was measured using the low anterior resection syndrome score.RESULTS: Of the 324 patients, 272 (84%) responded to at least 2 questionnaires and were included in the present study. Compared with pretreatment levels, the strongest decline was observed in physical, role, and social functioning at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Global health and cognitive functioning declined to a lesser extend, and emotional functioning gradually improved over the time. Within 24 months, the QOL scores had recovered toward the pretreatment levels in most patients. Compared with the general population, physical, role, social, and cognitive functioning and symptoms of fatigue and insomnia remained significantly worse in patients on longer-term. After low anterior resection, major bowel dysfunction was reported by 44% to 60% of the patients. Increasing urinary incontinence and severe complaints of impotence were observed in patients who had undergone abdominoperineal resection.CONCLUSION: Rectal cancer treatment is associated with a significant decline in QOL during the first 6 months after the diagnosis. Within 2 years, most patients return toward pretreatment functioning but could still experience poorer functioning and treatment-related symptoms compared with the general population. These findings support shared decision-making and emphasize the need for postoperative supportive care and novel treatment approaches.",Excluded

1137,"Perception of sniff phase in mouse olfaction. Olfactory systems encode odours by which neurons respond and by when they respond. In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons. Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery to cognitive centres, neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system. However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues. To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses. Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly.",Excluded

Ongoing protocols testing the efficacy of thoracic irradiation should be able to settle question of the optimal treatment approach in limited-stage SCLC over the next 1 to 2 years. Careful attention to volume treated and the use of shrinking fields produce the best results with the minimum of toxicity. Treatment of extensive-stage SCLC has not been substantially improved to date with the addition of local systemic irradiation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of CNS failure in SCLC and should be given, at a minimum, to patients achieving complete response status. Whether patients with partial response should also receive prophylactic cranial irradiation remains controversial. Finally, half-body radiation in SCLC is an experimental research technique that has shown some promise but remains quite toxic when combined with systemic chemotherapy.",Excluded

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images were obtained of a phantom with 1 mm diameter vessels containing iodine at concentrations between 4.5 and 50 mg/cc. The detection threshold concentration of iodine was determined by inspecting DSA images obtained at a range of x-ray tube voltages and input exposure levels. Surface doses were obtained from measured x-ray tube output data, and corresponding values of energy imparted were determined using the exposure-area product incident on the phantom. In one series of experiments, the air kerma at the image intensifier (X) was varied between 0.44 muGy per frame and 8.8 muGy per frame at a constant x-ray tube voltage of 70 kVp. In a second series of experiments, the tube voltage was varied between 50 and 100 kVp, and the mAs adjusted to maintain a constant exposure level at the input of the image intensifier. At a constant x-ray tube voltage, the surface dose and energy imparted were directly proportional to the input exposure per frame used to acquire the DSA images. On our DSA system operated below 2.2 muGy per frame, the threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to X<sup>-0.57</sup>, which is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction for a quantum noise limited imaging system. Above 2.2 muGy per frame, however, the threshold iodine concentration was proportional to X<sup>-0.26</sup>, indicating that increasing the input exposure above this value will only achieve modest improvements in image quality. At a constant image intensifier input exposure level, increasing the x-ray tube voltage from 50 kVp to 100 kVp reduced the surface dose by a factor of 6.1, and the energy imparted by a factor of 3.5. The detection threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to kVp<sup>n</sup>, where n was 2.1 at 1.1 muGy per frame, and 1.6 at 3.9 muGy per frame.

It was reported that acupuncture or electro-acupuncture (EA) is effective in reducing the body weight for obese patients, although the mechanisms remain obscure. In a previous study, we have found that rats fed with high-fat (HIF) diet developed diet-induced obesity (DIO) with a concomitant decrease in the hypothalamic content of the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide, a peptide with anorexiogenic effect. To assess the central effect of EA on DIO rat, we revealed that EA up-regulated the expression of CART peptide in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the DIO rats. After feeding with HIF diet for 14 weeks, the DIO rats received EA stimulation three times per week for 4 weeks. The expression of CART peptide in ARC was measured using immunohistochemistry. The plasma ACTH was measured with ELISA. EA caused a reduction of both body weight and energy intake in DIO rats and increased the expression of CART peptide in ARC. The plasma ACTH was increased in response to restraint stress, but EA produced no further increase in ACTH levels.

OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery has become an important and minimally invasive alternative for patients with refractory trigeminal neuralgia. When a second procedure is necessary, the outcomes are unknown. The degree of pain relief and morbidity after repeat radiosurgery were studied.METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent a second gamma knife radiosurgery procedure because of unsatisfactory or unsustained relief of pain after the first procedure. Twenty-seven patients were assessable at median follow-up periods of 42.7 and 20.4 months after the first and second procedures, respectively. Most patients had undergone multiple previous operations of other types (microvascular decompression, radiofrequency rhizotomy, glycerol rhizotomy, balloon compression). The median target doses of the first and second radiosurgeries were 75 and 64 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated by a physician who did not participate in patient treatment.RESULTS: After the first radiosurgical procedure, 13 patients had an excellent response initially (complete relief without any medication), 3 had a good response (complete relief with some medication), 7 had a fair response (>50% relief), and 4 had a poor response (<50% pain relief or treatment failure). Repeat radiosurgery was performed in patients with recurrent or residual pain. After the second radiosurgical procedure, 5 patients had an excellent response, 8 had a good response, 10 had a fair response, and 4 had a poor response. Thirteen patients (48%) achieved complete pain relief (with or without medication).

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of spinal cord neoplasm caused by intrathecal stem cell transplantation in the setting of ""stem cell tourism."" BACKGROUND: Stem cell transplantation (SCT) into the neuraxis is being investigated as a potential therapy for a variety of neurologic conditions. However, studies to date have not demonstrated definitive benefit and reports have highlighted risks such as malignancy. Despite this, increasing numbers of individuals with neurologic disease are lured to international centers providing unregulated stem cell therapies, an industry termed ""stem cell tourism."" DESIGN: case report CASE: A 66-year-old man underwent multiple commercial infusions of stem cells (allogeneic, embryonic neural, and mesenchymal) at various sites around the world to treat deficits from an ischemic stroke. He subsequently developed progressive lower back pain, paraplegia, and urinary incontinence. MRI of the spine demonstrated an enhancing, intradural, extramedullary mass from T10 to the distal thecal sac encasing the cauda equina nerve roots and conus medullaris. RESULT(S): Histopathologic evaluation of biopsied tissue from T10 revealed two populations of cells: primitive-appearing atypical cells (~50[percnt] expressing SOX2; neural marker) and glial differentiated cells with vascular proliferation. Both populations demonstrated negative embryonic stem cell markers (OCT3/4) and leukocyte markers (CD45). Short tandem repeat molecular analysis showed 62 +/- 8 [percnt] of cells contained non-host DNA, most likely derived from one non-patient human. Oncopanel targeted exome DNA sequencing showed no pathogenic mutations. Radiation was administered with 48.6 Gy/27 fractions from C4 to thecal sac, delivered in 3 shrinking field doses. Subsequent imaging showed significant mass reduction and the patient reported improvement in right lower extremity mobility over the weeks following treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Unregulated intrathecal SCT can cause devastating complications. This patient's highly proliferative neoplasm developing from pluripotent stem cells supports the ideological shift to employ more differentiated cells in future SCT research.",Excluded
3215,"Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion aided with computer-assisted spinal navigation system combined with electromyography monitoring. BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive techniques are gaining wide-spread application in lumbar fusion surgery, because they may have advantage over conventional open surgery in approach-related morbidity. This research was aimed to evaluate the safety and accuracy of the techniques of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion by using a computer-assisted spinal navigation system combined with electromyography monitoring.METHODS: Sixteen patients underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. A computer-assisted spinal navigation system and electromyography were used for guiding pedicle screw placement. The operative duration, blood loss, complications, and fluoroscopic time were recorded. Clinical outcome was assessed by Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index. Radiographic images were obtained to evaluate the accuracy of pedicle screw placement and fusion rates.RESULTS: The Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores were vastly improved postoperatively. A total of 64 pedicle screws were implanted and three were regarded as misplacement by post-operative CT scan. Three screw trajectories were adjusted according to intra-operative stimulus-evoked electromyography monitoring. The average fluoroscopy time in each patient was 31.8 seconds, which equals to 7.9 seconds per pedicle screw. No patients had instrument related neurological complications, infection, implant failure or revision. Successful fusion was found in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of navigation system and real-time electromyography monitoring can make the minimally invasive operation more safe and accurate while decreasing radiation exposure time of the medical staff and patient and minimizing the chance and the degree of the pedicle screw misplacement.",Excluded

2399,"Malignant melanoma-a rare cause of metastatic pancreatic cancer. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Diagnosing metastatic malignant melanoma after resection of superficial melanoma. CASE: A 56-year-old Caucasian female who is a practicing minister started behaving unusually during one of her services. She began walking up to the alter at inappropriate times and her family was concerned about her behavior. This change in mentation continued into the next day and the decision was made to bring her to the hospital. The patient had a history of superficial malignant melanoma to the left axilla, which was treated with axillary dissection 13 years ago. Sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time was negative and the patient did not receive any further chemotherapy or radiation. She was monitored for 5 years with serial PET scans every 6 months along with chest Xrays, routine blood work and annual skin exams without evidence of disease recurrence. On this presentation, the patient had multiple episodes of tonicclonic seizures while in the ED for which she was given Ativan, Versed and IV Keppra. The patient denied previous CNS symptoms including headache, seizures, or vision changes. Imaging of the head revealed a large hemorrhagic frontal temporal brain lesion with smaller scattered lesions concerning for metastatic disease. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 2.2 x 1.6 cm peripancreatic tail mass. An endoscopic ultrasound was performed which showed a mass in the region of the tail of the pancreas. FNA was done with pathology positive for metastatic melanoma. Patient was referred to Oncology service for further management. IMPACT: Most pancreatic metastases occur in the first 1-3 years after treatment of the primary tumor and current guidelines recommend follow up 3-5 years thereafter. This case report raises a question about how long patient should be monitored after the successful treatment of superficial malignant melanoma. DISCUSSION: A variety of primary neoplasms metastasize to the pancreas. About 2% of pancreatic tumors are metastatic tumors. Common metastatic sites include the kidney, lung and colon. Metastasis of malignant melanoma to pancreas occurs as manifestation of widespread disease burden. Several factors influence survival in patients with primary melanoma, including specific clinical and pathological factors, histological subtype, anatomical location and lymph node involvement. Prognostic factors influencing survival in patients with malignant melanoma are largely unknown, but a longer disease free interval between the successful resection of primary malignancy and eventual development of metastasis to the pancreas has been reported to be associated with improved survival. Our patient presented 13 years following the treatment of primarymelanoma. The prognosis of metastatic malignant melanoma is poor. Studies suggest amean survival of only 6- 8 months in patients with systemic disease from melanoma. In several case series five-year survival rates are reported at less than 10%.",Excluded
2037,"Effects of 1800-MHz radiofrequency fields on circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin and testosterone in male rats. Radiofrequency fields (RF) at 1800 MHz are known to affect melatonin (MEL) and testosterone in male rats, but it remains to be determined whether RF affected circadian rhythm of these plasma hormones. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1800-MHz RF at 208 muw/cm2 power density (SAR: 0.5762 W/kg) at different zeitgeber (ZT) periods of the day, including 0 (ZT0), 4 (ZT4), 8 (ZT8), 12 (ZT12), 16 (ZT16), and 20 (ZT20) h. RF exposure was 2 h/d for 32 d. From each rat, the concentrations of plasma MEL and testosterone were determined in plasma after RF exposure and compared with controls. The results confirmed the existence of circadian rhythms in the synthesis of MEL and testosterone, but revealed an inverse relationship in peak phase of these rhythms. These rhythms were disturbed after exposure to RF, with the effect being more pronounced on MEL than testosterone. The most pronounced effect of RF exposure on MEL and testosterone appears to be in rats exposed to RF at ZT 16 and ZT0 h, respectively. Data suggest that regulation of testosterone is controlled by MEL and that MEL is more sensitive to RF exposure.",Excluded
3453,"Brain enzyme histochemistry following stabilization by microwave irradiation. The activities of various enzymes present in brain homogenates were assayed biochemically (a) with no pretreatment, (b) following a standard microwave treatment in saline and (c) after a standard microwave treatment in formalin. All enzyme activity was lost after the microwave - formalin in treatment. Following microwave - saline treatment, the activities of alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, isocitrate and succinate dehydrogenases were reduced. In contrast, the activities of lactate and malate dehydrogenases were unchanged, and that of acetylcholinesterase apparently increased. Analogous outcomes were seen following attempted histochemical demonstrations of these enzymes. Thus satisfactory histochemical demonstration of all enzymes was achieved (except with alkaline phosphatase, lactate and malate dehydrogenases) following the microwave-saline pretreatment. Since acid phosphatase, catalase and peroxidase were also successfully demonstrated, it seems that microwave-saline pretreatments permit both retention of sufficient enzyme activity for histochemical demonstration to occur and retention of sufficient structural integrity for critical morphological investigations. Since the failure to stain the sites of lactate and malate dehydrogenases is not due to microwave inactivation of these enzymes, their demonstration may be possible by varying the staining procedures.",Excluded

2192,"Medical prevention and treatment of radiation-induced carotid injury. Radiotherapy has significantly improved the survival of cancer patients but is also associated with several adversities, including radiation-induced carotid injury (RICI). The RICI mechanisms are complex, including vessel inflammatory injury, carotid atherosclerosis, intimal proliferation, media necrosis, and peri-adventitial fibrosis. The main manifestation and adverse consequence of RICI is carotid artery stenosis (CAS), which can lead to stroke and transient ischemic attack. Currently, carotid artery injury is primarily diagnosed via color-coded duplex sonography. Early detection of traumatic changes in the carotid artery depends on measurements of carotid intima-media thickness; serum biomarker testing also shows great potential. CAS is mainly treated with carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty and stent implantation. Notably, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are advantageous in RICI treatment and reduce carotid inflammation, oxidative stress, and delaying atherosclerosis. This review summarizes the mechanisms, examination methods, and latest treatments for RICI to provide data for its clinical prevention and treatment.",Excluded
3361,"Improved synthesis of SV2A targeting radiotracer [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J. Introduction: [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J is a tracer developed for PET (positron emission tomography) that has high affinity towards synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein believed to participate in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in neurons and endocrine cells. The localisation of SV2A in the synaptic terminals makes it a viable target for in vivo imaging of synaptic density in the brain. Several SV2A targeting compounds have been evaluated as PET tracers, including [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, with the aim to facilitate studies of synaptic density in neurological diseases. The original two-step synthesis method failed in our hands to produce sufficient amounts of [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, but served as an excellent starting point for further optimizations towards a high yielding and simplified one-step method. [<sup>11</sup>C]Methyl iodide was trapped in a clear THF-water solution containing the trifluoroborate substituted precursor, potassium carbonate and palladium complex. The resulting reaction mixture was heated at 70 degreeC for 4 min to produce [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J.

PURPOSE: To review outcomes for patients with skull base meningiomas treated using the stereotactic proton beam at the National Accelerator Center (NAC), Republic of South Africa.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions.RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits. Analyzing different dose/fractionation schedules, an alpha/beta value of 3.7 Gy for meningiomas is estimated.CONCLUSION: Proton irradiation is effective and safe in controlling large and complex-shaped skull base meningiomas.",Excluded

Introduction Ccombination chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used for adjuvant treatment of stage III-IV endometrial cancer. The goal of this study was to review the treatment duration, toxicity, and survival for patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Methods Women with stage III-IV endometrial cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation between 2006 and 2013 were included. Toxicities were classified per CTCAE v3.0 and RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify treatment and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Results Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 (range 33-85). Thirty-six patients (70.6%) had endometrioid histology, 13 patients (25.5%) had serous, clear cell, or mixed histology, and 2 women (3.9%) had carcinosarcoma. Forty-eight patients had stage III disease and three patients were stage IVB. Mean treatment duration was 107 +/- 19 days. Forty-two patients received all planned chemotherapy, and 16 patients required a dose reduction. Thirty-four patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, the majority of which were hematologic. There were no deaths related to therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received leukocyte growth factors, and 25% of patients received a blood transfusion. Seven late grade 3-4 complications occurred: four gastrointestinal and two genitourinary, and one patient had ongoing neuropathy. Median progression-free survival was 42.8 months (range 4.4-81.5 months) and median overall survival was 44.9 months (range 5.1-82.6 months). Three-year overall survival was 80%.

256,"The progress in research on changes of central venous pressure under simulated weightlessness and microgravity. [Chinese]. One of the most profound circulatory changes that occur in man during exposure to microgravity is a cephalad redistribution of fluid. Central venous pressure (CVP) is not only an important standard for determining the cephalad redistribution of fluid but also the unique valuable means for measuring continuously cardiac filling pressure under simulated weightlessness (SW) and microgravity, and has a relationship with neurohumoral [correction of nerohumoral] regulation. With the development of manned spaceflight, the researches in space suggested that CVP did not increase, which is directly contradictory to the previous results under SW. This paper mainly discusses the changes of CVP and the effects of countermeasures on CVP under SW and microgravity, and the mechanisms of decreased CVP under microgravity. It is postulated that more suitable SW models, more studies about the area of low pressure including especially pulmonary circulation, and comprehensive studies in multiple systems are needed.",Excluded
824,"Challenges Conveying Clinical Equipoise and Exploring Patient Treatment Preferences in an Oncology Trial Comparing Active Monitoring with Radiotherapy (ROAM/EORTC 1308). Introduction: Providing balanced information that emphasizes clinical equipoise (i.e., uncertainty regarding the relative merits of trial interventions) and exploring patient treatment preferences can improve informed consent and trial recruitment. Within a trial comparing adjuvant radiotherapy versus active monitoring following surgical resection for an atypical meningioma (ROAM/EORTC-1308), we explored patterns in communication and reasons why health practitioners may find it challenging to convey equipoise and explore treatment preferences. Material(s) and Method(s): Qualitative study embedded within ROAM/EORTC-1308. Data were collected on 40 patients and 18 practitioners from 13 U.K. sites, including audio recordings of 39 patients' trial consultations, 23 patient interviews, and 18 practitioner interviews. Qualitative analysis drew on argumentation theory. Result(s): Practitioners acknowledged the importance of the research question that the trial aimed to answer. However, they often demonstrated a lack of equipoise in consultations, particularly with eligible patients who practitioners believed to be susceptible to side effects (e.g., cognitive impairment) or inconvenienced by radiotherapy. Practitioners elicited but rarely explored patient treatment preferences, especially if a patient expressed an initial preference for active monitoring. Concerns about coercing patients, loss of practitioner agency, and time constraints influenced communication in ways that were loaded against trial participation. Conclusion(s): We identified several challenges that practitioners face in conveying equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences in oncology, and particularly neuro-oncology, trials with distinct management pathways. The findings informed communication about ROAM/EORTC-1308 and will be relevant to enhancing trial communication in future oncology trials. Qualitative studies embedded within trials can address difficulties with communication, thus improving informed consent and recruitment. ROAM/EORTC-1308 RCT: ISRCTN71502099. Implications for Practice: Oncology trials can be challenging to recruit to, especially those that compare treatment versus monitoring. Conveying clinical equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences can enhance recruitment and patient understanding. This study focused on the challenges that practitioners encounter in trying to use such communication strategies and how practitioners may inadvertently impede patient recruitment and informed decision making. This article provides recommendations to support practitioners in balancing the content and presentation of trial management pathways. The results can inform training to optimize communication, especially for neuro-oncology trials and trials comparing markedly different management pathways. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

2816,"Pulsed infrared radiation excites cultured neonatal spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons by modulating mitochondrial calcium cycling. Cochlear implants are currently the most effective solution for profound sensorineural hearing loss, and vestibular prostheses are under development to treat bilateral vestibulopathies. Electrical current spread in these neuroprostheses limits channel independence and, in some cases, may impair their performance. In comparison, optical stimuli that are spatially confined may result in a significant functional improvement. Pulsed infrared radiation (IR) has previously been shown to elicit responses in neurons. This study analyzes the response of neonatal rat spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons in vitro to IR (wavelength = 1,863 nm) using Ca(2+) imaging. Both types of neurons responded consistently with robust intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) transients that matched the low-frequency IR pulses applied (4 ms, 0.25-1 pps). Radiant exposures of ~637 mJ/cm(2) resulted in continual neuronal activation. Temperature or [Ca(2+)] variations in the media did not alter the IR-evoked transients, ruling out extracellular Ca(2+) involvement or primary mediation by thermal effects on the plasma membrane. While blockage of Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+) plasma membrane channels did not alter the IR-evoked response, blocking of mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycling with CGP-37157 or ruthenium red reversibly inhibited the IR-evoked [Ca(2+)]i transients. Additionally, the magnitude of the IR-evoked transients was dependent on ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid-dependent Ca(2+) release. These results suggest that IR modulation of intracellular calcium cycling contributes to stimulation of spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons. As a whole, the results suggest selective excitation of neurons in the IR beam path and the potential of IR stimulation in future auditory and vestibular prostheses.",Excluded

Background: Four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin and accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy (AHTRT) is the standard of care for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Irinotecan plus cisplatin significantly improved overall survival compared with etoposide plus cisplatin for extensive-stage SCLC. We compared these regimens for overall survival of patients with limited-stage SCLC. Method(s): We did this phase 3 study in 36 institutions in Japan. Eligibility criteria included age 20-70 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ functions. Eligible patients with previously untreated limited-stage SCLC received one cycle of etoposide plus cisplatin (intravenous etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-3; intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) plus AHTRT (1.5 Gy twice daily, 5 days a week, total 45 Gy over 3 weeks). Patients without progressive disease following induction therapy were randomised (1:1 ratio, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on ECOG performance status [0 vs 1], response to induction chemoradiotherapy [complete response plus near complete response vs partial response and stable disease], and institution) to receive either three further cycles of consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin or irinotecan plus cisplatin (intravenous irinotecan 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15; intravenous cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1). Patients, physicians, and investigators were aware of allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival after randomisation; primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144989, and the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000095. Finding(s): 281 patients were enrolled between Sept 1, 2002, and Oct 2, 2006. After induction etoposide plus cisplatin and AHTRT, 258 patients were randomised to consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin (n=129) or irinotecan plus cisplatin (n=129). In the etoposide plus cisplatin group, median overall survival was 3.2 years (95% CI 2.4-4.1). In the irinotecan and cisplatin group, median overall survival was 2.8 years (95% CI 2.4-3.6); overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 0.80-1.46], one-sided stratified log-rank p=0.70). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (120 [95%] in the etoposide plus cisplatin group vs 101 [78%] in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group), anaemia (44 [35%] vs 50 [39%]), thrombocytopenia (26 [21%] vs six [5%]), febrile neutropenia (21 [17%] vs 18 [14%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%] vs 13 [10%]). There was one treatment-related adverse event leading to death in each group (radiation pneumonitis in the etoposide plus cisplatin group; brain infarction in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group).

34,"Complete homonymous hemianopia due to cerebral infarction of the lateral geniculate body: A case report with diffusion tensor image findings. Background: The human lateral geniculate body (LGB) is the thalamic visual center linking the retina to the striate cortex. The human LGB has dual blood supplies from the anterior choroidal artery of the internal carotid artery and the lateral posterior choroidal artery of the posterior cerebral artery. Thus, complete homonemous hemianopia caused by cerebral infarction of the LGB is extremely rare. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented due to a sudden visual field defect. He had no other vascular risk factors or focal neurological deficits. Five days later, complete right homonymous hemianopia was detected by Humphrey automated perimetry. Brain MRI and DWI revealed an infarction at the left LGB. MRA revealed no obstruction or stenosis. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) showed decreased fractional anisotrophy value in the left occipital subcortical area (right, 0.436; left, 0.384). The density of optic radiation decreased more on the right side in tractography than on the left side. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Quadruple sectoranopia can be caused by lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the LGB which are supplied by the anterior choroidal artery. The lateral posterior choroidal artery supplies the central part of the LGB. Thus, occlusion of this artery produces a wedge-shaped homonymous hemianopsia or horizontal sectoranopia. However, despite the LGB lesion, our patient showed a complete homonemous hemianopia probably due to involvement of the whole LGB through occlusion of a variant vessel that supplied the whole LGB rather than simultaneous occlusion of 2 vessels.

1671,"The medial septum mediates impairment of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle induced by a hippocampal seizure or phencyclidine. The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats. An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD. It is suggested that the GABAergic but not the cholinergic septohippocampal neurons mediate the sensorimotor gating deficit.",Excluded

The dosage in intra-operative boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) using near-threshold <sup>7</sup>Li(p, n)<sup>7</sup>Be direct neutrons was evaluated using the validated calculation method. The effectiveness of the usage of the direct neutrons was confirmed from the existence of the region satisfying the requirements of the protocol utilized in intra-operative BNCT for brain tumours in Japan.

3561,"Mechanism of magnetization transfer during on-resonance water saturation. A new approach to detect mobile proteins, peptides, and lipids. The mechanism of magnetization transfer (MT) between water and components of the proton spectrum was studied ex vivo in a perfused cell system and in vivo in the rat brain (n = 5). Water was selectively labeled and spectral buildup consequential to transfer of longitudinal magnetization was followed as a function of time. At short mixing time (T(m)), nitrogen-bound solvent-exchangeable protons were observed, predominantly assigned to amide groups of proteins and peptides. At longer T(m), intramolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) was observed in the aliphatic proton region, leading to a mobile-macromolecule-weighted spectrum that resembles typical protein spectra described in the literature. This effect on the proton spectrum is distinct from that of classical off-resonance MT, which has been shown to be due to the immobile solid-like proton pool. When studying a solution of major brain metabolites under physiological concentrations and conditions (pH), no transfer effects were observed, in line with expectations based on reduced NOE effects in rapidly tumbling molecules and the fast proton exchange rates of amino, amine, SH, and OH groups. The spectral intensities of the amide protons may serve as indicators for pH and cellular levels of mobile proteins and peptides, while the aliphatic components are representative of several types of mobile macromolecules, including proteins, peptides, and lipids.",Excluded
2619,"Fractionated ionizing radiation accelerates loss of amplified MDR1 genes harbored by extrachromosomal DNA in tumor cells. In tumor specimens such as those from neuroblastoma, ovarian, and lung carcinoma patients, the prevalence of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules harboring amplified genes has been well established. In some cases, the amplified genes have been identified as oncogenes, and their increased expression appears to contribute to the maintenance and progression of the malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fractionated radiation treatment, given in daily doses similar to those administered clinically, on the stability of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules in cancer cells. Our studies were conducted with multidrug-resistant KB cells, which harbor extrachromosomal copies of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) almost exclusively on circular DNA molecules of approximately 750 and 1500 kb pairs. This size range is representative of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules that have been shown to harbor amplified oncogenes in vivo. Exponentially growing MDR KB cells were exposed to 1400 and 2800 cGy ionizing radiation administered in 7 and 14 fractions, respectively, at 200 cGy per fraction/day. A statistically significant decrease in MDR1 extrachromosomal gene copy number was reproducibly detected in the irradiated cells compared with unirradiated cells passaged for the duration of the experiment in the absence of radiation treatment. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in multidrug resistance and in P-glycoprotein levels, as determined by clonogenic dose-response assays and Western analyses, respectively. P-glycoprotein is a multidrug transporter encoded by the MDR1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies further determined that extrachromosomal circular DNA loss correlated to the entrapment of these DNA molecules in radiation-induced micronuclei. These results indicate that radiation-induced loss of extrachromosomally amplified genes from tumor cells via their entrapment in micronuclei contributes to the improved therapeutic response observed for some cancers.",Excluded

1114,"Ocular and cerebral hemo-fluid dynamics in microgravity: A mathematical model. Purpose: Long-term exposure to microgravity is known to lead to visual impairment in many astronauts (VIIP syndrome). Upper body fluid shift, alterations in intraocular pressure (IOP), intracranial pressure (ICP), tissue biomechanics and blood flow are among the many factors hypothesized to contribute to VIIP. Due to the difficulty to single out each of these factors using in-vivo studies, we present a mathematical model to theoretically evaluate the interactions between fluid flows and pressures in the brain (blood, cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid) and eyes (blood and aqueous humor) and their possible mechanical implications in VIIP. Method(s): We propose a 0-dimensional (0d) mathematical model of fluid circulation in the eyes and brain, embedded into a 0d whole-body circulation model. The model includes retinal, choroidal and ciliary circulations in the eyes. As suggested in the literature, the effect of microgravity is accounted for by i) considering zero hydrostatic pressure, ii) imposing zero central venous pressure, iii) decreasing the blood/aqueous humor oncotic pressure difference (iv) increasing the blood-brain barrier permeability. The model simulates microgravity-induced fluid redistribution in the upper body vasculature and variations in IOP and ICP, which are critical factors for VIIP. Result(s): The model predicts that, in microgravity conditions, ICP and IOP increase (Fig1a) and ocular blood flow decreases markedly in the choroid and ciliary circulations (Fig1b). Blood flow in the retina is found to experience smaller variations, owing to a purely mechanical perfusion control mechanism mainly enacted by the intraocular venous segments. Conclusion(s): The model suggests that i) the venous segments play a fundamental role in controlling pressures and fluxes in the ocular circulation, owing to the possibility of their collapse, and ii) the retinal circulation is less susceptible to microgravity-induced alterations than choroid and ciliary. These findings point towards further clinical assessment of ocular venous function in microgravity as a potential determinant factor for VIIP.",Excluded

235,"Saturation of DNA repair measured by alkaline elution. To determine whether the half-times (T1/2) of the DNA repair processes measured by alkaline elution increased in a dose-dependent manner, exponentially growing 9L/Ro rat brain tumor cells were irradiated with doses of 15-50 Gy, and their DNA repair kinetics was measured by alkaline elution. At 15 Gy, the DNA repair kinetics was biphasic with the fast phase having a T1/2 approximately 6 min and the slow phase having a T1/2 approximately 42 min. As the dose was increased to 50 Gy, the fast-phase T1/2 remained at approximately 6 min, but the slow-phase T1/2 increased to approximately 87 min. Although a dose-dependent increase in the T1/2 of the slow phase of DNA repair (saturation) was measured by alkaline elution, both the absolute value of the slow-phase T1/2 and the dependency of the slow-phase T1/2 on dose were less than those measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation in zonal rotors with slow reorienting gradient capability. Thus these two techniques appear either to depend on different hydrodynamic properties of the DNA or to have different coefficients of dependency for the same hydrodynamic properties of the DNA. The lower sensitivity for detection of the dose dependency of DNA repair makes it unlikely that the alkaline elution technique will be useful for quantitatively relating the shape of mammalian cell survival curves to the doses at which saturation of a DNA repair process occurs.",Excluded

Discussion(s): This review focuses on different imaging techniques such as X-rays, PET, CTScan, and MRI. This survey identifies a different approach with better accuracy for tumor detection. This further includes the image processing method. In most applications, machine learning shows better performance than manual segmentation of the brain tumors from MRI images as it is a difficult and time-consuming task. For fast and better computational results, radiology used a different approach with MRI, CT-scan, X-ray, and PET.

2476,"Treatment of progression of diffuse astrocytoma by herbal medicine: Case report. Background: The paper presents the results of the use of phytotherapy in a 33-year-old woman who, after finishing the oncological treatment of diffuse astrocytoma, had tumour progression. Material(s) and Method(s): Phytotherapy was introduced after the tumour had progressed. It consisted of 4 types of herbal medicine which the subject was taking in form of tea once a day at regular intervals. The patient started phytotherapy along with temozolomide, which was the only oncological treatment she was under after the tumour had progressed. Following the finished chemotherapy, the patient continued the treatment with herbal medicine only. She regularly took phytotherapy without interruption and to the fullest extent for 30 months, and the results of treatment were monitored by periodic scanning using nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Result(s): The control scanning that was conducted after the end of combined treatment with temozolomide and phytotherapy showed tumour regression. The patient continued with phytotherapy after finishing chemotherapy and, during the following 24 months, it was the sole treatment option. In that period, the regression of the tumour continued, until a control examination 30 months after the introduction of phytotherapy showed no clinical and radiological signs of tumour. Conclusion(s): The results presented in this research paper clearly indicate the potential of phytotherapy in the treatment of some types of brain tumours. A complete regression of tumour following the treatment with nothing but herbal medicine offers support for such claim. Future research should demonstrate the effectiveness of phytotherapy, as a supplementary form of brain tumour treatment, and the results of this research should be compared with the existing information on the effectiveness of the protocols currently used in the treatment of these types of tumour.

2527,"Thoracic radiation-YES. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%-20% of all lung cancers, and the overwhelming majority (>95%) are associated with tobacco exposure. The incidence of all types of lung cancer, including SCLC, has been declining in the United States with the onset of tobacco smoking cessation programs, although this trend took nearly 20 years to become evident among men. Overall survival (OS) rates for patients with lung cancer have also increased by about 5% since the advent of low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect early lung cancer. The prognosis for patients with SCLC continues to be poor but has improved with the advent of smoking cessation campaigns, more effective chemotherapy agents and radiation planning and delivery techniques, and the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for those who experience a complete response to therapy. Consolidation with chest radiotherapy has improved OS among patients with extensive-stage SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. SCLC often presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal involvement is common with or without pleural effusion and extrathoracic disease. Extrathoracic spread (i.e., extensive-stage disease) is also quite common, being present in 80%-85% of cases at diagnosis. Brain metastases are present in approximately 20% of patients at diagnosis; roughly half of these metastases are symptomatic and the other half are detected by imaging. Predictors of poor prognosis include poor performance status, older age, and being male. The pathologic subtypes of the disease (small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma) all carry a similarly poor prognosis. Current guidelines of the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend the use of positron emission tomography (PET), CT scanning, or fused PET/CT scanning of the chest, liver, adrenals, bone, and other areas of concern in the diagnosis and staging of SCLC (NCCN guideline-SCLC 2017). Thoracic radiotherapy has also become important for improving OS among patients with SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. In one prospectively randomized study of 498 patients with extensive-stage SCLC (WHO performance status score 0-2) who achieved complete response to chemotherapy, patients who received consolidation thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) had significantly better 2-year OS rates than did those who did not receive thoracic radiotherapy (13% vs. 3%, P=0.004). Thoracic radiotherapy further improved thoracic-only failure rates (19.8% vs. 46% without, P=0.001) (Slotman B et al, Lancet Oncol 2015;385:36- 42). However, many patients with extensive-stage SCLC do not respond to the standard etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy (Fig 1). Those patients may need to receive molecular-targeted therapies or immunotherapy with the consolidating thoracic radiotherapy. Several histologic and immunohistochemical markers have been evaluated for diagnosing or monitoring treatment response in SCLC, including transcription thyroid factor-1 (positive in >85% of SCLC cases); cytokeratin 7; deletions in chromosome 3; Leu-7; chromogranin A; synaptophysin; myc amplification; and p53 mutations (present in ~75% of cases). Deletions in tumor-suppressor genes are also relatively common and include fragile histidine triad (FHIT) (80%); RAS effector homologue (RASSF1) (>90%); TP53 (>75%); retinoblastoma- 1 (RB1) (>90%); and retinoic acid receptor-beta (72%). However, to date no biomarkers have been validated for use in diagnosing SCLC. Moreover, mutations that are often present in non-small cell lung cancer (such as epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) are rare in SCLC. Several clinicopathologic features have been linked with worse prognosis, including poor performance status, significant weight loss, high lactate dehydrogenase levels, large numbers of metastatic sites, and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Because SCLC has the among the highest rates of somatic driver mutations, and because more than 95% of patie ts with SCLC are former or current smokers, immunotherapy seems a reasonable approach, as high mutation burdens correlate with good response to chemoradiotherapy and sensitivity to immunomodulators (Peifer M et al., Nat Genet 2012;44(10):1104-10). At MD Anderson Cancer Center, an ongoing phase I/II study of patients with extensive-stage SCLC has been proposed to the NRG as a prospective randomized study (PI J Welsh) (Fig 2). Use of thoracic radiotherapy to consolidate a site at which SCLC is quite likely to recur is reasonable, given that recurrence considerably reduces quality of their life as well as OS. In summary, in most cases SCLC presents as extensive-stage disease, for which outcomes are very poor. Consolidation with thoracic radiotherapy for patients who achieve a complete response to chemotherapy can improve 2-year OS rates. However, less toxic and more effective systemic treatment is also required to derive the greatest benefit from consolidation thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded
2631,"Update on small cell lung cancer management. Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) account for,15-20% of all lung cancers. Because SCLC is almost always associated with long-term tobacco smoking, abstinence from smoking and smoking cessation are crucial for primary prevention. Because symptoms are generally unspecific, the disease is often diagnosed late, with 70% of patients already in stage IIIb or IV at the time of diagnosis. Early detection of SCLC through screening is under investigation. Chemotherapy, generally a platinum-based combination, is the mainstay of therapy and is generally combined with radiation in the first-line treatment of tumours up to stage IIIb. Surgery has a place in the diagnosis and therapy of stage I SCLC, but plays no key role in advanced cancer. In patients who respond to first-line therapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation can prevent brain metastases and improve overall survival. Although the initial response to treatment is usually good, SCLC tends to relapse quickly. This makes second-line therapy quite important. Topotecan is the most studied and widely used agent in second-line therapy; however, newer agents, including biological therapies, are under study.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent a wide range of predominantly indolent tumors which may cause serious functional deficits if ignored yet its treatment may result in severe iatrogenic morbidity. Surgery and radiation therapy are both established modalities when treatment is warranted but how to integrate these two modalities to optimize tumor control, minimize iatrogenic morbidity and preserve organ function is not clearly established. To this end, a prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was established at our center over the past decade. Patients were diagnosed by anatomic and functional imaging characteristics typically determined by CT/MRI and octreotide avidity. In general, patients who had a solitary carotid body tumor were offered surgery; while those involving the skull base were offered radiation therapy and those with multiple paragangliomas were offered either surgery for the smaller tumor and radiation for the remaining tumors or radiation for all tumors. Materials/Methods: From 1998-2011, 51 patients (42F:9M) were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Median age was 64 years (range, 19-92 year). Paraganglioma subsites were as follows: jugular 44% (n=24), tympanic 20% (n=11), vagal 15% (n=8), carotid body 13% (n=7), parasympathetic 2% (n=1). Two patients had bilateral tumors, while 2 patients had 3 synchronous tumors. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy (21-50.4 Gy) treated with 3D technique in 72% (n=39), IMRT in 20% (n=11) or SBRT 2% (n=1). During this time period, 38 patients underwent primary surgery of whom 6 received adjuvant radiation therapy. Result(s): At a median follow-up of 34 months (4-103 mos), one patient treated with radiation therapy failed at 37 months for a 3 year actuarial LC 100% and 5 year LC 94%. None of the 38 surgically treated failed. Patients who received radiation therapy experienced grade 1/2 complications including mucositis (13%) or xerostomia (23%), and two patients developed dizziness (5%). Of patients who underwent surgical excision, four patients had post-operative cranial nerve deficits, including vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, hearing loss, and temporary facial nerve weakness. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this experience represents the first prospective algorithmic-based multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on single modality treatment that demonstrates excellent tumor control, low rates of severe iatrogenic morbidity and long-term function preservation. While both surgery and radiation result in excellent tumor control, radiation therapy should be considered a primary treatment for skull-based paraganglioma for which it offers a high therapeutic ratio.",Excluded
293,"Surgical management of recurrent Rathke's cleft cysts. Objective: Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs) are benign epithelial lesions of the sellar region, frequently treated with cyst fenestration and drainage, via a transsphenoidal craniotomy (TSC) approach. While these lesions are benign, they have an appreciable recurrence rate. At present, the literature contains limited data regarding factors contributing to recurrence in patients treated for recurrent cysts. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective analysis of pathology-confirmed RCCs from 1995 to 2016 in our institutional database. TSC for cyst fenestration and drainage was our first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with open craniotomy or radiation as a salvage therapy. Result(s): We identified 112 surgeries for RCC in 101 patients. The mean age of patients presenting for reoperation was significantly higher than for patients presenting for their first operation (42.4 +/- 17 years vs. 58.6 +/- 17 years, p < 0.001). Ninety-one surgeries (80.5%) were primary operations and 21 surgeries in 18 patients (19.5%) were reoperations. Of the 91 patients who underwent their first operation at our institution, eight (8.7%) required reoperation for recurrence. Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak repair was performed in 53% of cases and was more common in reoperation cases (71 vs. 48%, p < 0.04). There were no new neurological deficits or perioperative deaths; however, one patient developed an internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm requiring endovascular treatment. Two patients (9.5%) in the reoperation group developed a postoperative CSF leak, one of which resolved with lumbar drain and one of which required a reoperation. Of the 16 reoperation patients for whom data were available, 11/16 (68.6%) were on pituitary hormone supplementation prior to their reoperations, and 6/16 (37.5%) had diabetes insipidus (DI) requiring desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) at home. Of the 10 reoperation patients without DI prior to revision, the rates of transient hyponatremia (3/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.04) and transient DI (5/10 vs. 17/91, p=0.04) were significantly higher in the reoperation group. The rate of new permanent DI was not higher for reoperation patients (2/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.001). At the last clinical follow-up, 15% of patients reported worsened headaches, 52% reported unchanged headaches, and 33% reported improvement. Of the patients with visual deficits prior to surgery, 61.5% of patients reported improved vision, 30.8% of patients reported stable vision, and 7.7% of patients reported worsening of vision. RCC recurrence developed in 7/45 patients (15.6%) <40 years of age, compared with 22/64 patients (34.4%) =40 years of age (p < 0.04). Recurrence was observed in 4/10 RCCs (40%) with squamous metaplasia compared with 25/99 (25.2%) patients without squamous metaplasia (p=0.45). Recurrence was observed in 4/12 RCCs (33.3%) with inflammation which was not statistically different from the rates of recurrence in patients without inflammation 25/97 (25.7%, p=0.73). Conclusion(s): Reoperation for recurrent RCC is a safe and effective intervention for patients with recurrent visual symptoms or headaches. Many patients present with hypopituitarism, thus care should be taken to ensure adequate hormonal supplementation in the perioperative period. Additionally, patients should be counseled that hormonal recovery is unlikely and additional hormonal supplementation may be required following reoperation.

2593,"Challenges and practicalities in the clinical implementation of Lutetium 177 for therapeutic nuclear medicine: A technologist's perspective. Objectives: FDA approval of Lutetium177 (Lu177) treatment of neuroendocrine tumor is pending. Lu177 therapy is logistically different than any other currently used radionuclide therapeutic agent. We aim to present a technologist's perspective on potential challenges related to the implementation of Lu177 therapy including developing an institution's policy, identifying needed location/space, supplies, and staff requirements. Method(s): A Lu177 treatment regimen consists of 4 intravenous infusions of 200 mCi at 8 week intervals. Each therapeutic infusion is 4-6 hours, consists of the Lu177 infusion along with an infusion of amino acids and requires nursing supervision. During this process, to reduce radiation exposure, the patient must walk to the restroom every thirty minutes with an IV pole to void. The technologists met with the Authorized Users (AU), the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), and the other staff involved to review the requirements of radiation safety, workflow, and protocol of this therapy. Result(s): The radioactive materials license is to be amended. It was determined that Lu177 administration would ideally occur in our PET division due to department layout and patient flow. While the general nuclear medicine department has an injection room suited for therapeutic use, the restroom is not in close proximity, which is a radiation safety concern. In our PET center, there are 2 comfortable injection rooms used for long uptake periods located next to a restroom dedicated for radioactive patients. Due to the stated length of the Lu177 therapy session, the PET diagnostic schedule will be reduced on Lu177 therapy days. Lu177 therapies will be scheduled in coordination with other departments including oncology; pharmacy for obtaining amino acids; and nursing for the administration of IV fluids and vital sign monitoring. After the infusion is completed and the injection room is cleaned, radioactive waste will be moved to long term storage. Conclusion(s): Lu177 therapy is an exciting new development in the field of radionuclide therapy: however, its implementation brings new challenges to meet both radiation safety and protocol requirements. Space, workflow, and staffing must all be considered. Lu177 therapies will involve the coordination of AUs, the RSO, technologists, nursing staff, pharmacist, and logistics personnel. Having a successful Lu177 therapy program requires team work to develop site-specific and tailored solutions.",Excluded
1562,"SPECT image segmentation for estimation of tumour volume and activity concentration in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE radionuclide therapy. Background: Dosimetry in radionuclide therapy has the potential to allow for a treatment tailored to the individual patient. One therapeutic radiopharmaceutical where patient-specific dosimetry is feasible is <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE, used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. The emission of gamma photons by <sup>177</sup>Lu allows for imaging with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). One important step for dosimetry using this imaging technique is the SPECT image segmentation, which needs to be robust and accurate for the estimated quantities to be reliable. This work investigates different methods for automatic tumour delineation in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE SPECT images. Three segmentation methods are considered: a fixed 42% threshold (FT), the Otsu method (OM) and a method based on Fourier surfaces (FS). Effects of including resolution compensation in the iterative SPECT image reconstruction are also studied. Evaluation is performed based on Monte Carlo-simulated SPECT images from 24 h and 336 h post injection (p.i.), for determination of the volume, activity concentration and dice similarity coefficient. In addition, patient data are used to investigate the correspondence of tumour volumes when delineated in SPECT or morphological CT or MR images. Patient data are also used to examine the sensitivity to the operator-dependent initialization. Result(s): For simulated images from 24 h p.i. reconstructed without resolution compensation, a volume and activity-concentration root-mean-square error below 15% is typically obtained for tumours above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup> when using OM or FS, while FT performs considerably worse. When including resolution compensation, the tumour volume becomes underestimated and the activity concentration overestimated. The FS method appears to be robust to noise, as seen for the 336 h images. The differences between the tumour volumes estimated from the SPECT images and the volumes estimated from morphological images are generally larger than the discrepancies seen for the simulated data sets. Conclusion(s): Segmentation results are encouraging for future dosimetry of tumours with volumes above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup>. Using resolution compensation in the reconstruction may have a negative effect on volume estimation. Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).",Excluded

Therefore, we decided to analyse the expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in three GB cell lines before and after the impact of ionizing radiation. Design(s): We used three GB cell lines: T 98G, A172 and U 87MG. The expression of HLA-G and HLA-E was assessed before application of ionizing radiation (0-2-5-10-15- 20 Gy) and then was analysed again 24h and 72 h after radiation. HLA-G and HLA-E antigens were analysed flow-cytometrically. Result(s): The expression of both HLA-G and HLA-E by all three cell lines of GB was elevated significantly after irradiation, expecially expression of HLA-E in the line T 98G. (Graph Presented) Conclusion(s): We revealed that expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in GB cell lines alters significantly after the impact of ionizing radiation. This finding may represent a new, unrecognized pathway of the effect of ionizing radiation in cancer therapy. In GB, namely, HLA-E may function, in its elevated levels, as a ligand for activating receptor CD94/NKG2C, therefore mediating increased lysis of tumor cells.",Excluded
2486,"[Interactive determination of the parameters of mathematical models in planning radiotherapy of malignant tumors. 3. Method of local adjustment of the parameters of mathematical models (examples of application)]. To increase the accuracy of calculation of tolerance doses of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in normal organs and tissues by using mathematical models, the author has developed a method for local mathematical model parameter adjustment (LMMPA) which included analysis of the structure of a mathematical model, systematization of clinical information and its goal-oriented use to determine the parameters of a model. The necessity of developing the LMMPA method stemmed from the complexity of the body exposed to radiation a system and from the quest for taking into account the impact of the system on the values of mathematical models. LMMPA may be regarded as the extension of determination of the parameters of mathematical models or as the interactive determination of their parameters that describing radiation exposures of complex biological systems. Different aspects of using of LMMPA are indicated how to apply it to the determination of tolerance doses for connective tissue, lung tissue, and the brain by using the Ellis and LQ models. The extended LMMPA is shown how to determine the parameters of a mathematical models for calculation of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in the lung tissue.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To examine the influence of radiation dose reduction on image quality and sensitivity of Volume Perfusion CT (VPCT) maps regarding the detection of ischemic brain lesions.METHODS AND MATERIALS: VPCT data of 20 patients with suspected ischemic stroke acquired at 80 kV and 180 mAs were included. Using realistic reduced-dose simulation, low-dose VPCT datasets with 144 mAs, 108 mAs, 72 mAs and 36 mAs (80 %, 60 %, 40 % and 20 % of the original levels) were generated, resulting in a total of 100 datasets. Perfusion maps were created and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) measurements were performed. Qualitative analyses were conducted by two blinded readers, who also assessed the presence/absence of ischemic lesions and scored CBV and CBF maps using a modified ASPECTS-score.RESULTS: SNR of all low-dose datasets were significantly lower than those of the original datasets (p < .05). All datasets down to 72 mAs (40 %) yielded sufficient image quality and high sensitivity with excellent inter-observer-agreements, whereas 36 mAs datasets (20 %) yielded poor image quality in 15 % of the cases with lower sensitivity and inter-observer-agreements.CONCLUSION: Low-dose VPCT using decreased tube currents down to 72 mAs (40 % of original radiation dose) produces sufficient perfusion maps for the detection of ischemic brain lesions.KEY POINTS: * Perfusion CT is highly accurate for the detection of ischemic brain lesions * Perfusion CT results in high radiation exposure, therefore low-dose protocols are required * Reduction of tube current down to 72 mAs produces sufficient perfusion maps.",Excluded
1141,"Integration of the heart rhythmogenesis levels: heart rhythm generator in the brain. We propose that along with the intracardiac pacemaker, a generator of cardiac rhythm exists in the central nervous system--in the efferent structures of the cardiovascular center of the medullar oblongata. Signals in the medulla oblongata arise as a result of the hierarchic interaction of the brain structures. Neural signals originating there in the form of bursts of impulses conduct to the heart along the vagus nerves and after interaction with cardiac pacemaker structures, cause generation of the cardiac pulse in exact accordance with the frequency of ""neural bursts"". The intrinsic cardiac rhythm generator (the sinus node) is a life-sustaining factor that maintains the heart pumping function when the central nervous system is in a stage of deep inhibition, (e.g., under anesthesia or during unconsciousness). The brain generator is the factor that provides heart adaptive reactions in behaving organism.

1648,"Neuromagnetic responses to chords are modified by preceding musical scale. Previous psychological studies have shown that musical chords primed by Western musical scale in a tonal and modal schema are perceived in a hierarchy of stability. We investigated such priming effects on auditory magnetic responses to tonic-major and submediant-minor chords preceded by major scales and tonic-minor and submediant-major chords preceded by minor scales. Musically trained subjects participated in the experiment. During MEG recordings, subjects judged perceptual stability of the chords. The tonic chords were judged to be stable, whereas the submediant chords were judged to be unstable. Dipole moments of N1m response originating in the auditory cortex were larger in the left hemisphere for the submediant chords than for the tonic chords preceded by the major but not minor scales. No difference in the N1m or P2m moment was found for the chords presented without preceding scales. These results suggest priming effects of the tonal schema, interacting with contextual modality, on neural activity of the auditory cortex as well as perceptual stability of the chords. It is inferred that modulation of the auditory cortical activity is associated with attention induced by tonal instability and modality shift, which characterize the submediant chords.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of x-ray treatment on rats following spinal cord injury (SCI).METHODS: Forty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to spinal cord injury using the modified Allen weight-drop method. The animals were randomly divided into six groups. Two of the animal groups were irradiated with 10 Gy at the lesion site; another two groups were irradiated with 20 Gy; and the last two groups without irradiation were regarded as the sham group. One of the each of two animal groups was euthanized at different time points at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively, after irradiation. Spinal cord calluses were assessed using kinology and electrophysiology and histology methods.RESULTS: In all of the groups, the neurofilament (NF) counts at 14 weeks were found to be higher than that at 6 weeks after SCI. Both 10-Gy irradiated and 20-Gy irradiated groups were higher than those of the sham group at each time point (P < 0.05). The myelin basic protein (MBP) count decreased at 14 weeks after SCI in the irradiated groups (P < 0.05) but increased at 14 weeks in the sham group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the MBP count of the irradiated groups was lower than that of the sham group at 14 weeks (P < 0.05). The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Nogo-A counts at 14 weeks were higher than those at 6 weeks in all the groups (P < 0.05), and there was no statistical significance with kinology and electrophysiology tests in all groups.CONCLUSIONS: A self-repair mechanism exists after spinal cord injury, which lasts at least 14 weeks.

Background: It has been well established that Laser Therapy irradiation can give analgesia by affecting the conduction of the C fibers, the nerve fibers that carry pain impulses from the dental pulp to the brain. Currently, laser irradiation with an infrared (830 nm) wavelength for analgesia is being used very successfully in a number of dental procedures. Study: Thus far, however, the effect of laser irradiation has been limited to analgesia. Recently Dr. Roberta Chow has reported a great deal of success by utilizing the visible red wavelength in the peripheral nerves.

Here we report the first placebo-controlled study on continuous STN-HFS in a rat model of PD using an implantable microstimulation system. We found a significant increase of preserved dopaminergic nigral neurons on the lesioned side (expressed as ratio to the non-lesioned side) of approximately 50% in comparison to STN sham-stimulated and STN-naive rats.

2317,"A colourful clock. Circadian rhythms are an essential property of life on Earth. In mammals, these rhythms are coordinated by a small set of neurons, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The environmental light/dark cycle synchronizes (entrains) the SCN via a distinct pathway, originating in a subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that utilize the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4). The pRGCs are also innervated by rods and cones and, so, are both endogenously and exogenously light sensitive. Accumulating evidence has shown that the circadian system is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), blue, and green wavelengths of light. However, it was unclear whether colour perception itself can help entrain the SCN. By utilizing both behavioural and electrophysiological recording techniques, Walmsley and colleagues show that multiple photic channels interact and enhance the capacity of the SCN to synchronize to the environmental cycle. Thus, entrainment of the circadian system combines both environmental irradiance and colour information to ensure that internal and external time are appropriately aligned.",Excluded

The brains of wild-type (WT), untreated K3 and NIr-treated K3 mice, aged five months (thus after the onset of parkinsonian signs and neuropathology), were labelled immunohistochemically for the oxidative stress markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), hyperphosphorylated tau (using the AT8 antibody) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The average intensity and area of 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 immunoreactivity were measured using the MetaMorph software and TH+ cell number was estimated using stereology. Our results showed immunoreactivity for 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 within the SNc was increased in K3 mice compared to WT, and that this increase was mitigated by NIr. Results further showed that TH+ cell number was lower in K3 mice than in WT, and that this loss was mitigated by NIr. In summary, NIr treatment reduced the oxidative stress caused by the tau transgene in the SNc of K3 mice and saved SNc cells from degeneration. Our results, when taken together with those in other models, strengthen the notion that NIr treatment saves dopaminergic cells in the parkinsonian condition.",Excluded

1951,"Using biologically based objectives to optimize boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy planning for brainstem tumors in dogs. Irradiated brain tumors commonly progress at the primary site, generating interest in focal dose escalation. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to use biological optimization objectives for a modeling exercise with simultaneously-integrated boost IMRT (SIB-IMRT) to generate a dose-escalated protocol with acceptable late radiation toxicity risk estimate and improve tumor control for brainstem tumors in dogs safely. We re-planned 20 dog brainstem tumor datasets with SIB-IMRT, prescribing 20 x 2.81 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 20 x 2.5 Gy to the planning target volume. During the optimization process, we used biologically equivalent generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUD) as planning aids. These were derived from human data, calculated to adhere to normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) <=5%, and converted to the herein used fractionation schedule. We extracted the absolute organ at risk dose-volume histograms to calculate NTCP of each individual plan. For planning optimization, gEUD<sub>(a = 4) </sub> = 39.8 Gy for brain and gEUD<sub>(a = 6.3) </sub> = 43.8 Gy for brainstem were applied. Mean brain NTCP was low with 0.43% (SD +/-0.49%, range 0.01-2.04%); mean brainstem NTCP was higher with 7.18% (SD +/-4.29%, range 2.87-20.72%). Nevertheless, NTCP of < 10% in brainstem was achievable in 80% (16/20) of dogs. Spearman's correlation between relative GTV and NTCP was high (rho = 0.798, P < .001), emphasizing increased risk with relative size even with subvolume-boost. Including biologically based gEUD values into optimization allowed estimating NTCP during the planning process. In conclusion, gEUD-based SIB-IMRT planning resulted in dose-escalated treatment plans with acceptable risk estimate of NTCP < 10% in the majority of dogs with brainstem tumors.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT), a radiotracer tracking tryptophan transport and metabolism via the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway, can accurately differentiate glioma recurrence from radiation injury (J Nucl Med 2012;53:1058-64). We evaluated AMT uptake as a prognostic marker for survival in post-treatment patients with high-grade glioma. METHOD(S): AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients > 1 month (median: 325 days) after resection and chemoradiation of a grade III or IV astrocytic glioma. All patients were followed for at least 1 year or until death after PET. Maximum standardized uptake values (AMT-SUVmax) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor on MRI. Unidirectional AMT uptake (K) was also quantified from dynamic PETand blood radioactivity data (available in 34 cases). Optimal cutoff thresholds for prediction of 1-year survival were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and survival of patients with above vs. below threshold values was evaluated in thewhole group, and in two subgroups (glioblastoma [n = 33], no further surgical or radiation treatment after PET [n = 22]). RESULT(S): For 1-year survival, sensitivity/specificity was 84%/80% for AMT-SUVmax and 76%/88% for lesion/cortex K-ratio, when using ROC-defined cutoff thresholds. Both AMT-SUVmax and K-ratio were highly prognostic for survival in all patient groups. Estimated median survival after PET was 966 and 876 days in the low, vs. 177 days in both the high AMT-SUVmax and high K-ratio groups, respectively (log-rank: p, > 001). Age- and gradecorrected Cox regression analyses showed a robust association between high AMT values and shorter overall survival after the PET scan (SUVmax: OR= 6.2 [2.2-17.5], K-ratio: OR= 6.6 [2.3-18.6]; p<= > 001).

The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared. In this limited experience, TCD was proven to yield additional information, in repeated non-invasive studies, on the haemodynamic influence of AVMs and the effect of proton beam therapy.",Excluded
418,"Strategic planning workshop on research needs for neutron capture therapy. The workshop 'Research Needs for Neutron Capture Therapy', held in Williamsburg, VA, May 9-12. 1995 addressed key issues and questions related to optimization of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), in general, and to the possibility of success of the present BNCT trials at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in particular. Both trials use nuclear fission reactors as neutron sources for BNCT of glioblastoma multiforme (BNL) and of deep seated melanoma (MIT). Presentations and discussions focussed on optimal boron-labeled compounds, mainly for brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, and the best mode of compound delivery to the tumor. Also, optimizing neutron irradiation with dose delivery to the tumor cells and the issues of dosimetry of BNCT especially in the brain were discussed. Planning of treatment and of follow-up of patients, coordination of BNCT at various treatment sites, and the potential of delivery BNCT to various types of cancer with an appropriately tailored protocol were additional issues. The need for multicentric interdisciplinary cooperation among the different medical specialties was highlighted.",Excluded
1913,"Survivin a radiogenetic promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy independently from CArG motifs. BACKGROUND: Radiogenetic therapy is a novel approach in the treatment of cancer, which employs genetic modification to alter the sensitivity of tumor cells to the effect of applied radiation.AIM: To select a potent radiation inducible promoter in the context of brain tumors and to investigate if CArG radio responsive motifs or other elements in the promoter nucleotide sequences can correlate to its response to radiation.METHODS: To select initial candidates for promoter inducible elements, the levels of mRNA expression of six different promoters were assessed using Quantitative RTPCR in D54 MG cells before and after radiation exposure. Recombinant Ad/reporter genes driven by five different promoters; CMV, VEGF, FLT-1, DR5 and survivin were constructed. Glioma cell lines were infected with different multiplicity of infection of the (promoter) Ad or CMV Ad. Cells were then exposed to a range of radiation (0-12 Gy) at single fraction. Fluorescent microscopy, Luc assay and X-gal staining was used to detect the level of expression of related genes. Different glioma cell lines and normal astrocytes were infected with Ad survivin and exposed to radiation. The promoters were analyzed for presence of CArG radio-responsive motifs and CCAAT box consensus using NCBI blast bioinformatics software.RESULTS: Radiotherapy increases the expression of gene expression by 1.25-2.5 fold in different promoters other than survivin after 2 h of radiation. RNA analysis was done and has shown an increase in copy number of tenfold for survivin. Most importantly cells treated with RT and Ad Luc driven by survivin promoter showed a fivefold increase in expression after 2 Gy of radiation in comparison to non-irradiated cells. Presence or absence of CArG motifs did not correlate with promoter response to radiation. Survivin with the best response to radiation had the lowest number of CCAAT box.CONCLUSION: Survivin is a selective potent radiation inducible promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy and this response to radiation could be independent of CArG motifs.",Excluded
3601,"Effectiveness of lead cap in radiation protection of head in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Aims: Occupational head exposure of radiation was suggested to be associated with brain tumors in interventional cardiologists. The brain is of particular interest, because it is one of the least protected organs during interventional procedures. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the lead cap in radiation protection of the head and compare it with that of a ceiling mounted lead glass screen in a real life setting. Our secondary goal was to test the comfort and convenience of the lead cap when worn on a regular daily basis. Methods and Results: Radiation dose to the operator was recorded by the three dosimeters placed outside the lead cap, inside the cap and outside the apron at the level of trunk for a total of 18 months. Only the lead cap (Burkhart Roentgen International, St Petersburg, Florida, USA) but not the ceiling suspended protective glass screen was used during the first three months of measurement of radiation dose to the head. Later concomitant use of both protection devices was analysed. The dosimeter outside the cap recorded a dose of 2.77 mSv radiation when the ceiling mounted screen was not used during the first 3 months. The doses were 2.4 to 12.5 times higher in comparison to the measurements that were recorded when the ceiling suspended screen was used. However, a remarkable dose of radiation (ranged between 1.16-0.22 mSv) was received by the operators head despite the use of ceiling mounted screen. Yet, even without the protection of the ceiling mounted screen, the dose recorded by the dosimeter inside the lead cap during the first period was <0.1 mSv. As expected, the doses to the head recorded by the dosimeter inside the cap during the next 15 months period were also less than 0.1 mSv with the use of the ceiling mounted screen. Therefore, a cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless of the use of the screen. Conclusion(s): A cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence was much more protective than the mounted screen and reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless the use of the mounted screen. Although being a subjective conclusion, the operator regularly wearing the lead cap reported that the lead cap is reasonably comfortable and offers an acceptable wearing comfort when used on daily practice.",Excluded

2222,"Serum exosome proteomic profiling reveals molecular fingerprints of tissue injury caused by cancer chemotherapy. Exosomes are nanovesicles released from most cell types especially under cellular stress conditions including oxidative stress. It is well-recognized that in addition to ionizing radiation, nearly 50% of FDA- approved chemotherapeutics cause oxidative stress in target tissues. However, the tissue origin and contents of exosomes released from chemotherapy-treated cells and their contribution to tissue injury are unknown. Here we report that in human serum, exosomes isolated from cancer patients (n = 24) exhibit a significantly higher level of 4-hydroxynonenal adducted proteins post-chemotherapy (P<0.02). In mice, systemic injection of chemotherapeutic drugs exemplified by Doxorubicin (DOX) caused a two-fold increase in circulating exosomes (DOX-EXO) compared to saline-treated controls (SAL-EXO). The authenticity of exosomes in the serum was characterized by electron microscopy and by identification of exosome markers, including Alix, CD 63, and TSG 101. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that DOX-EXO has broader size distribution shifting to the larger size (25-200 nm) compared to SAL-EXO (10-120 nm). Proteomic analysis of mouse serum exosomes identified 329 and 275 proteins in SAL-EXO and DOX-EXO, respectively. Interestingly, proteins found in DOX-EXO serum, include glycogen phosphorylase brain, liver and muscle forms, implicate brain, liver and muscle as the source of exosomes in Dox treated animals. Proteins distinctly expressed in DOX-EXO serum also include proteins involved in DNA repair (XRCC3 and ERCC6), autophagy (TM9S1), and metabolic process (pyruvate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase). Thus, circulating exosomes are sensitive markers for tissues targeted by redox active chemotherapy and serve as cargo-carrying vehicles for the metabolic and repair proteins necessary for defense against chemotherapy-induced tissue injury.",Excluded
815,"Necessity of repeat head computed tomography (CT) scans in mild traumatic brain injury patients. INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical TBI severity grading system. CT scanning has also become a sensitive diagnostic tool in assessing TBIs. Currently, there is a widely varied practice in evaluation of patients with mild TBIs. We hypothesize that patients with an initially positive head CT and stable GCS (15) are less likely to have positive repeat CTs than patients who's GCS has dropped below 15. METHOD(S): A 5 year retrospective analysis was done (Jan 2007- Dec 2011). Data points included ISS, ICU LOS, Hospital LOS, initial GCS, first head CT scan, lowest GCS between scans, and treatment after 2nd CT. Positive CT findings were considered an increase in contusion, bleed, edema, midline shift, or a new bleed. RESULT(S): In 369 patients, those with a stable GCS (15) were less likely to have a positive repeat CT scan than patients who whose GCS dropped (12.9% vs 24.9%, p<.01). They also tended to require less Interventions (0.8% vs 4.0%, p=0.09). Unchanged patients were more likely to have a lower ISS (14 vs 17, p<.01), ICU LOS(2 vs 3 days, p<.01), and Hospital LOS( 4 vs 6, p<.01). CONCLUSION(S): CT scans are a rapid, non-invasive diagnostic tool that can accurately diagnose a patient's intracranial status. Our study shows that most patients who have initially positive CT scans and maintain a stable GCS of 15 can still safely forego the cost and radiation exposure of repeated scans.",Excluded
2463,"Adult patient doses in interventional neuroradiology. We investigated radiation doses to 149 adult patients who underwent interventional neuroradiologic procedures, consisting of 132 patients who had diagnostic imaging examinations and 17 patients who had therapeutic procedures. The interventional procedures were carried out on a biplane system capable of performing fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The x-ray imaging system was interfaced to a patient dosimetry system, which computed surface (skin) doses based on the selected radiographic technique factors in each of the radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging modes. For each patient, an assessment was made of the maximum surface dose received during the procedure, which predicts the possibility of inducing deterministic effects. Knowledge of the surface doses, beam quality and x-ray cross sectional area permitted the computation of the total energy imparted to each patient. Energy imparted values were converted to effective dose, which provides an estimate of the stochastic radiation risk to the patient. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during diagnostic imaging examinations was 1.3 Gy, with a maximum surface dose of 5.1 Gy. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during therapeutic procedures was 2.8 Gy with a maximum surface dose of 5.0 Gy. Ratios of the lateral to frontal median surface doses were 0.47 for diagnostic examinations and 0.68 for interventional procedures. The median energy imparted was 1.8 J during fluoroscopy, and 4.3 J during radiography, showing that on average, 66% of the patient exposure comes from radiographic imaging (DSA). For diagnostic examinations, the median patient effective dose was 33 mSv, with a maximum of 152 mSv. For therapeutic procedures, the median patient effective dose was 74 mSv, with a maximum of 156 mSv. In interventional neuroradiology, surface doses could induce deterministic effects, and the corresponding effective doses are noticeably higher than those normally encountered in diagnostic radiology.",Excluded
2394,"A critical period for estrogen action on neurons of the song control system in the zebra finch. The song nuclei of the male zebra finch (Poephila guttata) contain larger neurons than those of the female. This gender difference arises after hatching as a result of cell atrophy in the female and cell growth in the male. Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins. Estrogen loses its masculinizing effects completely after day 45 when the adult level of neuronal atrophy is reached. Thus, the end and the intensity of hormone action appear to be correlated with the timing of neuronal atrophy.",Excluded
778,"Effect of space flight and head-down bedrest on neuroendocrine response to metabolic stress in physically trained subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of plasma epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) responses to insulin induced hypoglycemia (ITT) 3 weeks before the space flight (SF), on the 5th day of SF, on the 2nd and 16th days after the landing in the first Slovak astronaut, and before and on the 5th day of prolonged subsequent head-down (-6 degrees) bed rest (BR) in 15 military aircraft pilots. Blood samples during the test were collected via cannula inserted into cubital vein, centrifuged in the special appliance Plasma-03, frozen in Kryogem-03, and at the end of the 8-day space flight transferred to Earth in special container for hormonal analysis. Insulin hypoglycemia was induced by i.v. administration of 0.1 IU/kg BW insulin (Actrapid HM) in bolus. Insulin administration led to a comparable hypoglycemia in pre-flight, in-flight conditions and before and after bed rest. ITT led to a pronounced increase in EPI levels and moderate increase in NE in pre-flight studies. However, an evidently reduced EPI response was found after insulin administration during SF and during BR. Thus, during the real microgravity in SF and simulated microgravity in BR, insulin-induced hypoglycemia activates the adrenomedullary system to less extent than at conditions of the Earth gravitation. Post-flight changes in EPI and NE levels did not significantly differ from those of pre-flight since SF was relatively short (8 days) and the readaptation to Earth gravitation was fast. It seems, that an increased blood flow in brain might be responsible for the reduced EPI response to insulin. Responses to ITT in physically fit subjects indicate the stimulus specificity of deconditioning effect of 5 days bed rest on stress response. Thus, the data indicate that catecholamine responses to ITT are reduced after exposure to real as well as simulated microgravity.",Excluded
3031,"Multiple myeloma with extramedullary dissemination to lung: A rare cause of pancoast syndrome. Introduction: Extramedullary plasmacytomas constitute 3% of plasma cell malignancies, and majority of which primarily occur in the head and neck. The occurrence of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma is less common. We report a case of multiple myeloma which presented as Pancoast syndrome due to extramedullary dissemination to lung. Case report: A 76-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with worsening of right shoulder pain for 2 days. He gave a 6 month history of sharp, persistent, right shoulder pain, radiating to medial aspect of arm and forearm associated with numbness and tingling. He subsequently underwent carpal tunnel release and ulnar nerve reposition surgeries. Examination revealed a hard, non mobile mass in the right supraclavicular fossa. Chest radiograph revealed a soft tissue density in the right lung apex and an extrapulmonary mass along the right lower chest wall (Image 1a). CT chest (Image 1b) and MRI spine (Image 1c) revealed multiple masses adjacent to the pleura on the right side and a large right apical lung mass involving the supraclavicular fossa, right posterior cervical space, prevertebral musculature with osseous and epidural invasion. A ultrasound guided biopsy of supraclavicular portion of the lung mass demonstrated neoplastic plasma cells (Image 2a). Serum and urine electrophoresis revealed monoclonal spike with IgG Lambda chains. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed multiple myeloma (Image 2b) and he was diagnosed with an unusual case of Pancoast syndrome caused by multiple myeloma with extramedullary dissemination to lung. He completed a course of palliative radiation to the right lung mass and is currently on bortezomib and prednisone. Discussion(s): Pancoast tumors are primarily non-small cell lung cancers. Multiple myeloma presenting as Pancoast syndrome is less common. The prognosis of these patients is poor. The typical thoracic manifestation of multiple myeloma is bony involvement of the thoracic cage. Other manifestations are pneumonia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, reticulonodular shadows, interstitial pattern and intrapulmonary calcification. Pancoast tumors, by their close vicinity to neurovascular structures like brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, often present with musculoskeletal pain and distal neurologic symptoms resulting in referral to orthopedicians or physiotherapists. Patients are initially treated for arthritis and bursitis of shoulder and a delay of 6-9 months have been reported in many cases before the tumor was discovered. We are reporting this case to emphasize the importance of including multiple myeloma in the work up of Pancoast syndrome. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes.

1026,"Prognostic factors in glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving high-dose particle radiotherapy or conventional radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of prognostic factors related to patient selection on survival outcomes. Survival outcomes were retrospectively analysed in a consecutive series of 67 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients who had received either conventional fractionated photon radiotherapy (CRT) or high-dose particle radiotherapy (HDT). In the CRT protocol, a total dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy was administered. In the HDT protocol, an average dose of approximately 30 GyE in a single session and additional fractionated photon irradiation of total dose 30 Gy were administered to patients receiving boron neutron capture therapy; and a total dose of 96.6 GyE was administered to patients receiving proton therapy. Most of the patients had received chemotherapy with nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) alone or with ACNU, procarbazine and vincristine. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival times for all patients were 17.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.6-20.9 months] and 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.9 months), respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 67.2% and 33.7%, respectively. For patients treated with HDT, the median OS was 24.4 months (95% CI, 18.2-30.5 months), compared with 14.2 months (95% CI, 10.0-18.3 months) for those treated with CRT. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed radiation modality (HDT vs CRT) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis class to be the significant prognostic factors. Age, sex, pre-operative performance status, treatment with or without advanced neuroimaging, extent of surgery and regimen of chemotherapy were not statistically significant factors in predicting prognosis.

When microtubules assembled in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were sheared, they rapidly depolymerized, recovered, and reassembled. The mean length of the recovered microtubules was the same as that observed just before shearing, implying that on average one fragment per original microtubule survived the fragmentation and recovery. When microtubules that contained 25 percent brain MAP were sheared, the fragments did not depolymerize extensively and the average length of the fragments decreased by a factor of 3 relative to the unsheared sample. The results support the dynamic instability model, which predicts that cellular microtubules are latently unstable structures protected on their ends by stabilizing caps.",Excluded

We correlated predicted radiation distributions in 29 patients with uveal melanoma (treated with 5,000 to 8,000 rads of helium ion therapy) with fundus photography and visual field deficits. The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate.

Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate inter- and intra-observer contouring variability during treatment planning for stage I lung cancers treated with SBRT, and to assess the effect of contouring training for physicians. Materials/Methods: Nine radiation oncologists (3 attendings, 6 residents) contoured the lung tumor internal target volumes (ITVs) in 6 patients using maximum intensity projection (MIP) images after 4D-CT simulation. Contouring was performed independently at 3 separate time points: prior to training based on department standards, after completing contouring training, and >2 weeks after the second session. Contouring variability was evaluated for variations in the magnitude of volumes (coefficient of variation (COV) = standard deviation/mean volume), the volume overlap (conformality index (CI) = common volume/encompassing volume), and differences in the centroid location. Contours were also compared clinically to determine radiographic features resulting in larger disagreement. Result(s): The mean volumes in cm3 for session 1, 2 and 3 were 6.52, 6.98 and 7.20 respectively. The mean COV for sessions 1 (0.25 +/- 0.05), 2 (0.24 +/- 0.04) and 3 (0.19 +/- 0.03) demonstrated significant improvement from session 1 to 3 (p = 0.03) while the CI also improved with each session, 0.35 +/-0.07, 0.36 +/-0.03 and 0.44 +/-0.04, respectively (p = 0.03 from session 1 to 3).

Conclusion(s): While there is large variation in contoured volumes, the centroid locations show excellent agreement. Intra- is smaller than interobserver variability; both can be improved with repeat contouring and standardized training, particularly in less experienced observers. Clinically, variability was most relevant for lesions with pleural attachments and spiculae suggesting a need for a standardized approach to contour such lesions.",Excluded

Type II T4 5'-deiodinase plays an essential role in converting T4 to T3 in extrathyroidal tissues, thus allowing the full development of a cellular effect of thyroid hormone. This enzyme is one of the most important factors in regulating local action of thyroid hormone. Its activity in the rat pineal was 20-30 times higher at midnight than at noon; this nocturnal rise was abolished by the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. The beta-agonist isoproterenol, caused a 3-fold increase in diurnal enzyme activity. There is thus a marked nyctohemeral variation in T4 activation in the pineal, probably mediated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Since the temporal peak of pineal T4 activation corresponds to that of pineal function, our data suggest a previously unrecognized role of thyroid hormone in pineal regulation.",Excluded

Background Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) facilitates the acquisition of cross-sectional imaging in angiography suites using a rotational C-arm and digital flat panel detectors. The applications are numerous, including evaluation of implanted devices and localization of cerebrovascular lesions. We present and validate the clinical utility of an alternative fast CBCT acquisition protocol in the context of neurovascular device imaging. Methods Contrast-enhanced (CE)-CBCT images were acquired using a new 10 s protocol in a phantom head model, swine model, and in patients. The acquisition parameters of both the 10 s and 20 s protocols were exactly the same, except for fewer projections (250 projections in 10 s vs 500 projections in 20 s), resulting in reduced scan time. Image quality was measured quantitatively in a controlled phantom study and qualitatively by blinded reviewers. The latter was performed to assess the image quality of the 10 s protocol pertinent to the device visibility and its apposition to the parent artery. Results 10 s CBCT images were comparable to 20 s CBCT in both phantom and animal studies. Of the 25 patient images, the reviewers agreed that they were able to discern the flow diverter struts and assess the apposition in all images. The overall rating for all 10 s images was 4.28 on a 5-point scale. No images were rated as less than 3, which was the average diagnostic quality. The ratings were concordant across three blinded reviewers (kappa =0.411). Additionally, contrast and spatial resolution between 10 s and 20 s images were similar in non-human models. Conclusions CBCT images of neurovascular devices can be obtained successfully using a 10 s acquisition protocol. In addition, the 10 s protocol offers faster acquisition, thus allowing its use in awake patients and with an added advantage of lower radiation and contrast dose.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has rapidly become a major diagnostic technique, displacing computed tomography (CT) as the primary neuroimaging modality in many disorders of the central nervous system. Neuroimaging studies are valuable in the diagnosis and management of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. This article reviews the technique of MRI and its role in identifying the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of these neurocutaneous syndromes.OBSERVATIONS: MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast without the use of ionizing radiation. It provides more detailed imaging than CT of the characteristic central nervous system lesions of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. In neurofibromatosis type 1, these include optic glioma, astrocytoma, and plexiform neurofibroma, and ""unidentified bright objects"" that are seen only with MRI. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2. Subependymal nodules and cortical and white matter tubers are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis. Manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome include leptomeningeal angiomatosis, hemiatrophy, cortical calcification, and patchy parenchymal gliosis and demyelination.CONCLUSIONS: MRI, especially with gadolinium enhancement, appears to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. MRI may be the imaging method of choice for following certain patients or screening family members. [References: 86]",Excluded

Wireless internet (Wi-Fi) electromagnetic waves (2.45 GHz) have widespread usage almost everywhere, especially in our homes. Considering the recent reports about some hazardous effects of Wi-Fi signals on the nervous system, this study aimed to investigate the effect of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi radiation on multisensory integration in rats. This experimental study was done on 80 male Wistar rats that were allocated into exposure and sham groups. Wi-Fi exposure to 2.4 GHz microwaves [in Service Set Identifier mode (23.6 dBm and 3% for power and duty cycle, respectively)] was done for 30 days (12 h/day). Cross-modal visual-tactile object recognition (CMOR) task was performed by four variations of spontaneous object recognition (SOR) test including standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. A discrimination ratio was calculated to assess the preference of animal to the novel object. The expression levels of M1 and GAT1 mRNA in the hippocampus were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results demonstrated that rats in Wi-Fi exposure groups could not discriminate significantly between the novel and familiar objects in any of the standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. The expression of M1 receptors increased following Wi-Fi exposure. In conclusion, results of this study showed that chronic exposure to Wi-Fi electromagnetic waves might impair both unimodal and cross-modal encoding of information.",Excluded
1768,"Effect of gravity and microgravity on intracranial pressure. KEY POINTS: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure on Earth. Gravity has a profound effect on fluid distribution and pressure within the human circulation. In contrast to prevailing theory, we observed that microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure. This being said, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Thus, over 24 h in zero gravity, pressure in the brain is slightly above that observed on Earth, which may explain remodelling of the eye in astronauts.ABSTRACT: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This syndrome is considered the most mission-critical medical problem identified in the past decade of manned spaceflight. We recruited five men and three women who had an Ommaya reservoir inserted for the delivery of prophylactic CNS chemotherapy, but were free of their malignant disease for at least 1 year. ICP was assessed by placing a fluid-filled 25 gauge butterfly needle into the Ommaya reservoir. Subjects were studied in the upright and supine position, during acute zero gravity (parabolic flight) and prolonged simulated microgravity (6 deg head-down tilt bedrest). ICP was lower when seated in the 90 deg upright posture compared to lying supine (seated, 4 +/- 1 vs. supine, 15 +/- 2 mmHg). Whilst lying in the supine posture, central venous pressure (supine, 7 +/- 3 vs. microgravity, 4 +/- 2 mmHg) and ICP (supine, 17 +/- 2 vs. microgravity, 13 +/- 2 mmHg) were reduced in acute zero gravity, although not to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Prolonged periods of simulated microgravity did not cause progressive elevations in ICP (supine, 15 +/- 2 vs. 24 h head-down tilt, 15 +/- 4 mmHg). Complete removal of gravity does not pathologically elevate ICP but does prevent the normal lowering of ICP when upright. These findings suggest the human brain is protected by the daily circadian cycles in regional ICPs, without which pathology may occur.",Excluded
2347,"Lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR): dosimetric considerations for chest wall toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate chest wall pain in patients with peripheral early stage lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and to identify factors predictive of Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events Grade 2 + chest wall pain.METHODS: Patients who received 55 Gy in five fractions were included. A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded
1735,"Effects of delta-conotoxins PVIA and SVIE on sodium channels in the amphibian sympathetic nervous system. delta-Conotoxins are a family of small, disulfide-rich peptides found in the venoms of predatory cone snails (Conus). We examined in detail the effects of delta-conotoxin PVIA from the fish hunting cone snail Conus purpurascens on sodium currents in dissociated sympathetic neurons from the leopard frog Rana pipiens. We also compared this toxin's effects with those of delta-conotoxin SVIE from Conus striatus, another piscivorous cone snail. d-PVIA slowed the time-course of inactivation of delta sodium currents and shifted the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Similar, albeit more pronounced, effects were seen with d-SVIE. While the effects of d-PVIA were reversed by washing, those of d-SVIE were largely irreversible over the time-course of these experiments. The effects of d-PVIA could be suppressed by conditioning depolarizations in a voltage- and time-dependent manner, whereas the effects of d-SVIE were largely resistant to conditioning depolarizations. Last, in intact sympathetic nervous system preparations, d-PVIA inhibited evoked trains of compound action potentials. Many of these effects of d-PVIA and d-SVIE are remarkably similar to those of toxins that bind to site 3 on voltage-gated sodium channels.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To report toxicity and overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (hypo-IMRT) with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with newly diagnosed GBM after biopsy or resection and with adequate performance status and organ or bone marrow function were eligible for this study. Patients received postoperative hypo-IMRT to the surgical cavity and residual tumor seen on T1-weighted brain MRI with a 5-mm margin to a total dose of 60 Gy in 10 fractions (6 Gy/fraction) and to the T2 abnormality on T2-weighted MRI with 5-mm margin to 30 Gy in 10 fractions (3 Gy/fraction). Concurrent TMZ was given at 75 mg/m(2)/day for 28 consecutive days. Adjuvant TMZ was given at 150 to 200 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days every 28 days. Toxicities were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were treated, consisting of 14 men, 10 women; a median age of 60.5 years old (range, 27-77 years); and a median Karnofsky performance score of 80 (range, 60-90). All patients received hypo-IMRT and concurrent TMZ according to protocol, except for 2 patients who received only 14 days of concurrent TMZ. The median number of adjuvant TMZ cycles was 6.5 (range, 0-14). With a median follow-up of 14.8 months (range, 2.7-34.2 months) for all patients and a minimum follow-up of 20.6 months for living patients, no instances of grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity were observed. The median OS was 16.6 months (range, 4.1-35.9 months). Six patients underwent repeated surgery for suspected tumor recurrence; necrosis was found in 50% to 100% of the resected specimens.CONCLUSION: In selected GBM patients, 60 Gy hypo-IMRT delivered in 6-Gy fractions over 2 weeks with concurrent and adjuvant TMZ is safe. OS in this small cohort of patients was comparable to that treated with current standard of care therapy.",Excluded
1520,"Hitting a moving target: evolution of a treatment paradigm for atypical meningiomas amid changing diagnostic criteria. OBJECT: The World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified atypical meningiomas in 2000, creating a more clear and broadly accepted definition. In this paper, the authors evaluated the pathological and clinical transition period for atypical meningiomas according to the implementation of the new WHO grading system at their institution. METHOD(S): A total of 471 meningiomas occurring in 440 patients between 1994 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed to determine changes in diagnostic rates, postoperative treatment trends, and early outcomes. RESULT(S): Between 1994 and 2000, the incidence of the atypical meningiomas ranged from 0 to 3/year, or 4.4% of the meningiomas detected during the entire period. After 2002, the annual percentage of atypical meningiomas rose over a 2-year period, leveling off at between 32.7 and 35.5% between 2004 and 2006. The authors also found a recent trend toward increased use of adjuvant radiation therapy for incompletely resected atypical meningiomas. Prior to 2003, 18.7% were treated with this therapy; after 2003, 34.4% of lesions received this treatment. Incompletely resected tumors were treated with some form of radiation 76% of the time. In cases of complete resection, most patients were not given adjuvant therapy but were expectantly managed by close monitoring using serial imaging and by receiving immediate treatment for tumor recurrence. The overall recurrence rate for expectantly managed tumors was 9% over 28.2 months, and 75% of recurrences responded to delayed radiation therapy. CONCLUSION(S): The authors documented a significant change in the proportion of meningiomas designated as atypical during a transition period from 2002 to 2004, and propose a conservative strategy for the use of radiation therapy in atypical meningiomas.",Excluded
183,"Effect of Pregabalin on Radiotherapy-Related Neuropathic Pain in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial. PURPOSE: Neuropathic pain is an unavoidable treatment-related adverse event among patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of pregabalin versus placebo in the treatment of radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in four centers in China. Eligible patients with a mean pain intensity score of 4 or more on an 11-point numeric rating scale were randomly assigned to receive either active treatment with a flexible dose of pregabalin or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was pain reduction measured on the numeric rating scale.RESULT: There were 128 patients who received treatment as randomly assigned. Pain intensity reduction was 2.44 in the pregabalin arm and 1.58 in the placebo arm at week 16, yielding an adjusted mean difference of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.44; P = .003). In the pregabalin arm, 38 patients (59.4%) achieved at least 30% pain relief versus 21 (32.8%) in the placebo arm ( P = .006). Nineteen patients (29.7%) in the pregabalin group and five (7.8%) in the placebo group achieved 50% or greater pain relief ( P = .003). Total scores on the Profile of Mood States-Short Form, pain severity and functional interference of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, as well as the physiology and psychology domain of the WHO Quality of Life-BREF all were reduced significantly at week 16 in patients who received pregabalin compared with those who received placebo. There was no significant difference ( P = .29) in the incidence of experiencing at least one adverse event in the pregabalin arm (n = 35; 54.7%) versus the placebo arm (n = 29; 45.3%).CONCLUSION: Patients treated with pregabalin with radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain had greater pain alleviation, better mood states, and higher quality of life compared with patients in the placebo group, with a good tolerability.",Excluded

The action of 550 W/m2 (mean) 3100 MHz pulsed radiation on the rabbit retina in vivo was investigated by fundus photography, blood-retinal barrier tracers, light and electron microscopy, either after a single 1--1.5 h exposure or after a series of repeated 1 h exposures for up to 53 h during about 100 days. The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers. There was no evidence of blood brain barrier leakage. These studies show that the rabbit eye can be affected by microwave radiation at intensities lower than previously reported.",Excluded

The present study explored the effects of nitric oxide on the spinal long-term potentiation associated with nociception. (1) Nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (1 mM, 20 microl) and the nitric oxide scavenger hemoglobin (2 mg/ml, 20 mul) strikingly blocked the induction of tetanic sciatic stimulation-induced spinal long-term potentiation of C-fiber-evoked field potentials. L-arginine, a substrate of nitric oxide synthase, completely reversed L-NAME-induced inhibition. However, D-NAME (1 mM, 20 microl), an inactive form of L-NAME, had little effect on the spinal LTP. (2) The same tetanic sciatic stimulation induced long-term thermal hyperalgesia, which was blocked by pre-application of L-NAME. These results suggest the involvement of nitric oxide in the spinal long-term potentiation of C-fiber-evoked field potentials and related behavior changes.",Excluded

After adaptation to cyclic illumination (14:10 light-dark cycle; intensity = 1.4 log ftc) male albino rats were exposed to brighter light (2.15 log ftc) seven hours daily for 25 days. The extent of retinal damage was determined histologically. Daily exposure to bright light in the morning produced greater photoreceptor loss than daily afternoon exposure. Severe retinal damage was partially prevented by brief light adaptation (20 minutes duration, at 1.4 log ftc intensity) before the onset of morning exposure. However, light adaptation did not remove the differential effect of time of day. The authors conclude that increased light exposure during the period of rod outer segment phagocytosis enhances photoreceptor damage.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To review the outcome of patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer receiving daily thoracic irradiation (RT) to approximately 60 Gy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of patients treated with RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer between 1991 and 1999 at Duke University were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-five patients were identified who had received continuous course once-daily 1.8-2 Gy fractions to approximately 60 Gy (range 58-66). All patients received chemotherapy (CHT); 32 received concurrent RT/CHT and 33 sequential CHT and then RT. Prophylactic cranial RT was administered to 17 patients. The time from diagnosis to local failure, tumor progression, and death was assessed using actuarial methods. The median follow-up for all patients was 16.7 months and for surviving patients was 29.6 months. The median age was 64 years (range 36-83), and the median Karnofsky performance status was 80 (range 50-100).RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial rate of local failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 40%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. One case of acute Grade 3 esophagitis developed. Ten late complications occurred: four pulmonary, two esophageal, two infectious, one leukemia, and one retinal toxicity with prophylactic cranial RT. Six were mild and resolved with treatment.CONCLUSION: CHT plus approximately 60 Gy of once-daily RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer was generally well tolerated. The survival rates were less than have been reported using 45 Gy in 1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions (2-year overall survival rate 47% compared with 30% in this study), but may be comparable because fewer than one-half our patients received concurrent CHT/RT and only 26% received prophylactic cranial RT. The relatively low rate of normal tissue morbidity in our patients supports the use of conventional once-daily fractionation to > or = 60 Gy. A randomized trial would be required to compare the outcomes after maximally tolerated dose twice-daily RT vs. maximally tolerated dose daily RT.",Excluded

Hallmarks of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a family of genetic diseases, are a typical rod-cone-degeneration with initial night blindness and loss of peripheral vision, followed by decreased daylight sight and progressive visual acuity loss up to legal blindness. Great heterogeneity in nature and function of mutated genes, variety of mutations for each of them, variability in phenotypic appearance and transmission modality contribute to make RP a still incurable disease. Translational research relies on appropriate animal models mimicking the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the human pathology. Here, we provide a systematic, morphological and functional analysis of Rho<sup>Tvrm4</sup>/Rho<sup>+</sup> rhodopsin mutant mice, originally described in 2010 and portraying several features of common forms of autosomal dominant RP caused by gain-of-function mutations. These mice undergo photoreceptor degeneration only when exposed briefly to strong, white light and allow controlled timing of induction of rod and cone death, which therefore can be elicited in adult animals, as observed in human RP. The option to control severity and retinal extent of the phenotype by regulating intensity and duration of the inducing light opens possibilities to exploit this model for multiple experimental purposes. Altogether, the unique features of this mutant make it an excellent resource for retinal degeneration research.",Excluded

3121,"Robustness of neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors in the absence of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels. Determining the contribution of a single type of ion channel to information processing within a neuron requires not only knowledge of the properties of the channel but also understanding of its function within a complex system. We studied the contribution of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels to neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors by combining genetic and electrophysiological approaches with biophysical modeling. We show that the Shab gene encodes the slow delayed rectifier K+ channel and identify a novel voltage-gated K+ conductance. Analysis of the in vivo recorded voltage responses together with their computer-simulated counterparts demonstrates that Shab channels in Drosophila photoreceptors attenuate the light-induced depolarization and prevent response saturation in bright light. We also show that reduction of the Shab conductance in mutant photoreceptors is accompanied by a proportional drop in their input resistance. This reduction in input resistance partially restores the signaling range, sensitivity, and dynamic coding of light intensities of Shab photoreceptors to those of the wild-type counterparts. However, loss of the Shab channels may affect both the energy efficiency of coding and the processing of natural stimuli. Our results highlight the role of different types of voltage-gated K+ channels in the performance of the photoreceptors and provide insight into functional robustness against the perturbation of specific ion channel composition.",Excluded
2768,"Radionuclide antibody-conjugates, a targeted therapy towards cancer. Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an investigational procedure which utilises monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptide conjugates and/or other chemical compounds. These bio-vectors are able to transport a dose of alpha particles to destroy cancer cells. Radionuclide antibody-conjugates (RACs), labelled with beta emitters, have already been used in humans. More recently, TAT has been introduced to treat oncological diseases mainly leukaemia and lymphoma. Encouraging results have also been obtained in solid neoplasms with the administration of anti-tenascin. This chimeric antibody labelled with astatine-211 was delivered in patients with recurrent brain tumours into a surgically created cavity. Conversely, a clinical trial using a standard TAT approach to treat patients with metastatic melanoma, observed the shrinkage of the solid tumour mass. This response in melanoma may lead to an alternative mechanism for TAT, called tumour-antivascular- alpha-therapy (TAVAT), and forms the basis of a novel approach to the treatment of cancer disease states. In this paper, we will concentrate mainly on the application of TAT using antibodies. In particular, an investigation into the major general features connected with the use of alpha emitters in cancer therapy will be discussed. The prospective role of TAT with RACs will also be outlined briefly, especially focussing on the most important therapeutic strategies to date based on antibodies radiolabelled with beta emitters.",Excluded

Purpose The aim of this study was to estimate the amount of CT studies performed in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital that are not indicated by Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) guidelines and to analyze factors that contribute to unnecessary examinations. Methods A total of 955 brain CT examinations performed for minor head injuries were randomly retrospectively selected. Medical records were assessed for the following parameters: demographics, cause of head trauma, and referring physician's seniority and specialty. For each CT scan, it was determined whether the CT referral met the CCHR criteria. The CT interpretations of patients under 65 years of age were evaluated to assess the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the CCHR criteria. Results A total of 104 examinations (10.9%) were not indicated according to the CCHR, but in patients younger than 65 years, 104 of 279 examinations (37.3%) were not indicated. Neurologists conducted more unwarranted CT studies (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; P = .011), whereas surgeons tended to order fewer studies (OR, 0.676; P = .126). There was no statistically significant difference between the seniority of the referring physician and over-referral (P = .181). Four-wheel motor vehicle accidents (OR, 2.789; P = .001) and a hit on the head by an object (OR, 2.843; P = .006) were associated with a higher rate of nonindicated CT examinations. The CCHR had sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% for either brain hemorrhage or fractures. Conclusions Overuse of CT examinations for minor head injuries was demonstrated, especially in young patients, with an excess of 37.3%. Contributing factors are referring physician specialty and injury mechanism. Analysis of overuse causes can be implemented for education programs and for computerized referring protocols.

3043,"Static magnetic field effect on the arterial baroreflex-mediated control of microcirculation: implications for cardiovascular effects due to environmental magnetic fields. Increasing evidence suggests that time-varying and static magnetic fields in the environment might affect the cardiovascular system. To explore the underlying physiology, the effect of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on the carotid baroreflex control of microcirculation was studied. Twenty-four hemodynamic monitorings were performed in rabbits sedated by pentobarbital infusion (5 mg/kg/h) during experiments that lasted 120 min. Mean femoral artery blood pressure, heart rate, and ear lobe skin microcirculatory blood flow, measured by microphotoelectric plethysmogram (MPPG), were simultaneously recorded before and after a 40 min exposure of the sinocarotid baroreceptors to Nd(2)-Fe(14)-B alloy magnets (n = 14) or sham magnets (n = 10, control series). The local SMF field was 350 mT, at the baroreceptors' site. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated from heart rate/blood pressure response to intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. A significant positive correlation was found between the SMF-induced increase in BRS (DeltaBRS = BRS(afterSMF) - BRS(priorSMF)) and the increment in microvascular blood flow (DeltaMPPG = MPPG(afterSMF) - MPPG(priorSMF)) (r = 0.66, p < 0.009). The SMF probably modulated the arterial baroreflex-mediated microcirculatory control.

508,"Response of extracranial lesions after treatment of metastatic melanoma with cranial radiation and ipilimumab. Purpose/Objective(s): Case reports and animal studies suggest combining radiation and immunotherapy may generate responses outside the radiation field. We sought to explore this phenomenon in a systematic fashion by evaluating melanoma patients with brain metastases who were treated with both radiation and ipilimumab. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of sixteen consecutive patients who received ipilimumab and 51 courses of braindirected radiation at a single institution from 2008 to 2013. We examined responses of the largest ""index"" extra-cranial lesion after 31 of these courses where imaging was available before and after treatment and compared this response to two consecutive studies performed prior to radiation therapy when available. Overall survival was calculated from the last day of the first brain-directed radiation therapy course using the Kaplan-Meier method. Responses before and after radiation therapy were compared using McNemar's and the binomial tests for clustered data. Twogroup exact tests for clustered data were used to explore the impact of treatment timing on response. Result(s): Median survival after initial radiation was 14 months, with maximum survival of 50 months. After radiation therapy, the largest index extra-cranial lesion shrank in 35% of 31 instances with sequential imaging as compared to a 17% favorable response rate in the 25 instances with two scans prior to radiation (p = 0.20). There was also a 2.8-fold increased likelihood that the kinetics of index lesion response improved following radiation therapy that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). Index lesions were more likely to respond when ipilimumab was administered within three months of radiation (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Historical series of melanoma patients with brain metastases describe median survival of less than 6 months, and less than 4 months in patients treated with radiation therapy without surgery for these lesions. Our data suggest patients treated with ipilimumab and radiation therapy may fare better than these historical controls. There was a trend for favorable systemic response following radiation therapy worthy of further evaluation in studies powered to detect potential synergies between radiation and immunotherapy.",Excluded

The data from 13 patients treated between 1984 and 2006 satisfied the World Health Organization 2007 definition of Grade III meningioma. A total of 24 surgeries were performed, including 13 primary, 7 salvage, and 4 second salvage. Also, 14 courses of radiotherapy (RT) were administered, including fractionated RT in 3 patients after primary surgery, fractionated RT in 4 patients after salvage surgery, salvage stereotactic radiosurgery to six separate areas in 3 patients, and salvage intensity-modulated RT in 1 patient.RESULTS: From the primary surgery, the median survival was 3.4 years, the 5-year survival rate was 47.2%, and the 8-year survival rate was 12.2%. The median time to recurrence was 9.6 months. A trend was seen toward longer survival for patients who had received adjuvant RT after initial surgery compared with those treated with surgery alone. Two patients developed radiation necrosis, and three had surgical complications.CONCLUSION: This is one of the few studies reporting the outcomes for malignant meningioma patients according to recent definitions. Our results are consistent with existing reports of the overall poor outcomes for atypical and malignant meningioma patients.

2975,"Ketamine pre-treatment dissociates the effects of electroconvulsive stimulation on mossy fibre sprouting and cellular proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), the experimental analogue of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), has been shown to produce both functional and structural effects in the hippocampal formation in infrahuman species. These changes may relate to the antidepressant and cognitive effects of ECT observed in patients treated for severe depressive disorders. Recent studies have described both enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and sprouting of mossy fibre projections from granule cells. The behavioural significance of these effects remains uncertain. In this study, we examined whether ketamine, a clinically available non-competitive NMDA receptor channel blocker, could block both of these ""trophic"" effects. Rats were given a course of eight spaced ECS or sham treatments under either halothane or ketamine anaesthesia. The thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine was administered to assess the degree of hippocampal cell proliferation and mossy fibre sprouting was quantified using the Timm staining method. Pre-treatment with ketamine dissociated these effects such that mossy fibre sprouting was attenuated significantly, while cell proliferation was unaffected.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no plasmacytosis and although there was a raised CSF protein concentration, no paraprotein band was detected, despite the presence of serum paraprotein. The infiltration of the dura mater is likely to have arisen by spread from contiguous bone lesions, contrasting with the pattern of spread seen in myelomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, which probably occurs through haematogenous seeding of the meninges. Leptomeningeal involvement is associated with a very poor prognosis; however, this patient had a favourable response to combined chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy, suggesting that myelomatous involvement of the dura mater should be considered as a distinct complication of myeloma.",Excluded
2530,"Growth factor gene-modified mesenchymal stem cells in tissue regeneration. There have been marked changes in the field of stem cell therapeutics in recent years, with many clinical trials having been conducted to date in an effort to treat myriad diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the cell type most frequently utilized in stem cell therapeutic and tissue regenerative strategies, and have been used with excellent safety to date. Unfortunately, these MSCs have limited ability to engraft and survive, reducing their clinical utility. MSCs are able to secrete growth factors that can support the regeneration of tissues, and engineering MSCs to express such growth factors can improve their survival, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue reconstructing abilities. As such, it is likely that such genetically modified MSCs may represent the next stage of regenerative therapy. Indeed, increasing volumes of preclinical research suggests that such modified MSCs expressing growth factors can effectively treat many forms of tissue damage. In the present review, we survey recent approaches to producing and utilizing growth factor gene-modified MSCs in the context of tissue repair and discuss its prospects for clinical application.

565,"Amyloid fibril formation of alpha-synuclein is accelerated by preformed amyloid seeds of other proteins: implications for the mechanism of transmissible conformational diseases. Alpha-synuclein is one of the causative proteins of familial Parkinson disease, which is characterized by neuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies include not only alpha-synuclein but also aggregates of other proteins. This fact raises a question as to whether the formation of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils in Lewy bodies may occur via interaction with fibrils derived from different proteins. To probe this hypothesis, we investigated in vitro fibril formation of human alpha-synuclein in the presence of preformed fibril seeds of various different proteins. We used three proteins, Escherichia coli chaperonin GroES, hen lysozyme, and bovine insulin, all of which have been shown to form amyloid fibrils. Very surprisingly, the formation of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibril was accelerated markedly in the presence of preformed seeds of GroES, lysozyme, and insulin fibrils. The structural characteristics of the natively unfolded state of alpha-synuclein may allow binding to various protein particles, which in turn triggers the formation (extension) of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils. This finding is very important for understanding the molecular mechanism of Parkinson disease and also provides interesting implications into the mechanism of transmissible conformational diseases.",Excluded
131,"New approaches in primary central nervous system lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has long been associated with an inferior prognosis compared to other aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). However, during the past 10 years an accumulation of clinical experience has demonstrated that long-term progression-free survival (PFS) can be attained in a major proportion of PCNSL patients who receive dose-intensive consolidation chemotherapy and avoid whole brain radiotherapy. One recent approach that has reproducibly demonstrated efficacy for newly diagnosed PCNSL patients is an immunochemotherapy combination regimen used during induction that consists of methotrexate, temozolomide, and rituximab followed by consolidative infusional etoposide plus high-dose cytarabine (EA), administered in first complete remission (CR). Other high-dose chemotherapy-based consolidative regimens have shown efficacy as well. Our goal in this review is to update principles of diagnosis and management as well as data regarding the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL, information that may constitute a basis for development of more effective therapies required to make additional advances in this phenotype of aggressive NHL.",Excluded
1121,"Effects of background illumination on the horizontal cell responses in the tiger salamander retina. Synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) was studied in the flat-mounted isolated retinas of the tiger salamander. Background illumination expedited the rise time of the HC light response, and the HC response rise time (HCRRT) reached steady state about 2 sec after the onset of the background illumination. The change in HCRRT is probably responsible for the background-induced enhancement of the HC responses to short light stimuli. The amplitude of the HC responses to 100 msec light steps in the presence of background illumination was 2-5 times larger than that measured under dark-adapted conditions. Background illumination exerted little effect on the response rise time in cones and bipolar cells, and thus it caused no significant response enhancement in those cells. The background-induced change in HCRRT correlated closely with the rod voltage but not with the HC voltage. These results suggest that the background-induced change in HCRRT is probably mediated by postsynaptic events in HCs because no significant time course change is observed in photoreceptors and bipolar cells (which share the same synapses with the HCs). A suppressive rod action on the cone inputs in HCs may be responsible for modulating the HCRRT. By shortening the HCRRT, background illumination regulates the frequency response of the photoreceptor-HC synapse and alters the capacity of spatial resolution of retinal bipolar cells.",Excluded

Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a hard hereditary neurodegenerative syndrome, which is characterized by strongly enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation, genetic instability and high risk of tumor and progeria features. Previously, we have shown that in the cells of patients with AT simultaneously two oppositely-directed development programs are proceeding: accelerated aging or the rise of the classical markers of aging number, such as the SA-beta-ga1, SAHF, HP1-gamma, gamma-H2AX, 53BP; and transformation or a sharp decline in the effectiveness of DNA repair processes and a high level of chromosomal rearrangements.<sup>1,2,3</sup> The cause of the disease is a mutation in the protein kinase ATM localized on chromosome 11 (11q22.3).<sup>4</sup> Up until now more than 80 mutations (on the locations of which the severity of the disease is dependent) resulting in the development of AT on this gene have been described.<sup>5</sup> Basing on the dynamics of the process of repair after gamma irradiation we can determine not only the presence of the AT syndrome, but its heterozygous.

PURPOSE: Pseudoprogression (psPD) is now recognised following radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of psPD following RT/TMZ and the effect of psPD on prognosis.MATERIALS/METHODS: All patients receiving RT/TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a prospective database. Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis.

1402,"Antegrade transapical branched aortic arch endograft-a feasibility study in pigs. Background: To describe the technique and proof the concept of a complete transapical deployment of a single sidebranch arch endograft in a porcine model. Method(s): Eight domestic pigs were operated with antegrade transapical delivery of a single-sidebranch arch endograft including a mating stentgraft to the innominate artery. Technical feasibility, operating time, radiation parameters and hemodynamic changes were studied according to standardized protocol during baseline (T0), after establishing of the transapical access and through-and-through wire (T1) and after stent-graft deployment (T2). Myocardial and cerebral perfusion were assessed by fluorescent-microspheres (FM) and transit-time-flow measurement (TTFM). Result(s): Transapical access, introduction and deployment of the endograft, sidebranch catheterization and deployment of the mating stent-graft were feasible in 6 of the 8 animals with unimpeded perfusion of the innominate artery. One animal was lost during transapical access, one during sire-branch catheterization. The mean operating and fluoroscopy times were 157+/-47min and 15.9+/-3.2min. During introduction and deployment of the stent-graft transient aortic valve insufficiency occurred in all animals. Hemodynamic stability recovered within ten minutes after retrieval of the delivery system in all animals. The innominate artery was patent with unchanged TTFM-flow measurements throughout the procedure. FM evaluation revealed stable myocardial and cerebral perfusion. Conclusion(s): Antegrade transapical access to the aortic arch for implantation of a single sidebranch arch endograft is feasible in a porcine model with reversible impact on hemodynamic measures during deployment. Transapical access allows for deployment of a complex endograft through a single large bore access-site in a porcine model. It might be a future treatment option for selective patients.",Excluded

Purpose To explore the use of PINS radiofrequency (RF) pulses to reduce RF power deposition in multiband/simultaneous multislice imaging with the RARE/turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence at 3T and 7T. Methods A PINS-TSE sequence was implemented and combined with blipped CAIPI to improve the reconstruction of superposed slices. Whole brain imaging of healthy volunteers was performed at both 3T and 7T using a 32-channel coil for signal reception. Results A considerable reduction in power deposition was achieved compared with a standard sequence of the manufacturer. At 3T, the reduction in specific absorption rate (SAR) made short pulse repetition times (TRs) possible, however, in order to obtain a good T2 contrast, it is advisable to maintain TR while extending the echo train length. At 7T, whole brain coverage with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 2 mm<sup>3</sup> was achieved in an acquisition time of 150 s. Furthermore, it could be shown that pulse sequences that use PINS pulses do not suffer from having additional magnetization transfer contrast. Conclusion PINS RF pulses combined with multiband imaging reduce SAR sufficiently to enable routine TSE imaging at 7T within clinically acceptable acquisition times. In general, the combination of multiband imaging with PINS RF pulses represents a method to reduce total RF power deposition. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Exposure to verapamil (0.1 to 10 muM) significantly increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the electrically-evoked overflow of tritium, without affecting the spontaneous outflow of radioactivity. Exposure to diltiazem in concentrations up to 100 muM had no effect on the electrically evoked release of [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline, but increased the basal outflow of radioactivity at 10 and 100 muM. The preferential alpha<inf>2</inf>-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.1 muM) significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of clonidine or adrenaline on [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline overflow elicited by electrical stimulation.

PURPOSE: To develop and investigate a set of biophysical models based on a mechanically coupled reaction-diffusion model of the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor growth after radiation therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Post-radiation therapy response is modeled using a cell death model (M<sub>d</sub>), a reduced proliferation rate model (M<sub>p</sub>), and cell death and reduced proliferation model (M<sub>dp</sub>). To evaluate each model, rats (n = 12) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI at 7 time points over 2 weeks. Rats received either 20 or 40 Gy between the third and fourth imaging time point. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to estimate tumor cell number within enhancing regions in contrast-enhanced MRI data. Each model was fit to the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor cell number from time point 1 to time point 5 to estimate model parameters. The estimated model parameters were then used to predict tumor growth at the final 2 imaging time points. The model prediction was evaluated by calculating the error in tumor volume estimates, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number.RESULTS: For both the rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gy, significantly lower error in tumor volume, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number was observed for the M<sub>dp</sub> and M<sub>p</sub> models compared with the M<sub>d</sub> model. The M<sub>dp</sub> model fit, however, had significantly lower sum squared error compared with the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>d</sub> models.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that for both doses, the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>dp</sub> models result in accurate predictions of tumor growth, whereas the M<sub>d</sub> model poorly describes response to radiation therapy.",Excluded

Background: Adjuvant therapy for melanoma has centered on high dose interferon for now almost 20 years. Recently, the FDA approved ipilimumab dosed at 10 mg/kg (10/kg ipi) for use in high risk resected melanoma. Though these two treatment options are available they still have limits in terms of efficacy with approximately 1 year of relapse free survival benefit (HDI and 10/kg ipi) and a modest overall survival benefit (HDI). Toxicity remains an issue as well with both therapies. S1404 is a Phase III, open label trial which seeks to compare currently available FDA approved treatments to one year of pembrolizumab in patients at high risk of relapse and death after surgery. Study Design: 1,378 patients will be randomized 1:1 to an FDA approved standard therapy, or pembrolizumab.

1828,"Pyruvate kinase and aspartate-glutamate carrier distributions reveal key metabolic links between neurons and glia in retina. Symbiotic relationships between neurons and glia must adapt to structures, functions, and metabolic roles of the tissues they are in. We show here that Muller glia in retinas have specific enzyme deficiencies that can enhance their ability to synthesize Gln. The metabolic cost of these deficiencies is that they impair the Muller cell's ability to metabolize Glc. We show here that the cells can compensate for this deficiency by using metabolites produced by neurons. Muller glia are deficient for pyruvate kinase (PK) and for aspartate/glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1), a key component of the malate-aspartate shuttle. In contrast, photoreceptor neurons express AGC1 and the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, which is commonly associated with aerobic glycolysis in tumors, proliferating cells, and some other cell types. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified type of metabolic relationship between neurons and glia. Muller glia compensate for their unique metabolic adaptations by using lactate and aspartate from neurons as surrogates for their missing PK and AGC1.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The association between early radiological lung reactions consequent upon radiotherapy and patients' symptoms is not well established. This prospective study examined the association between symptoms experienced by the patient, clinical findings observed by the physician and reactions visible in chest X-ray as interpreted by a radiologist, as well as the association between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms induced by radiotherapy after different methods of surgery.METHODS: Altogether 207 consecutive breast cancer patients entered the trial between 1st October 1997 and 31st December 1998. Chest X-rays were taken at entry and 3, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. The frequency and intensity of symptoms as well as clinical and chest X-ray findings were assessed over time.RESULTS: Skin and breast symptoms were common after radiotherapy but seldom severe (9%). Lung reactions were seen in chest X-ray in 47% of patients in re-evaluation by a radiologist at 3 months. The frequency of lung or skin symptoms did not correlate with chest X-ray findings, but there was a significant correlation between skin and lung symptoms. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery for node-positive breast cancer caused lung reactions seen in chest X-ray more often than after mastectomy when using other techniques. The reactions were most common at the 6 month evaluation (P=0.01). Concomitant adjuvant chemo- or endocrine therapy did not significantly increase the incidence of lung reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Skin, breast and lung symptoms were frequent after radiotherapy, but there was no real association between lung or skin symptoms and chest X-ray findings. The only correlation noted was between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms experienced by patients. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery was more frequently linked to chest X-ray findings than radiotherapy after mastectomy. We conclude that routine chest X-ray after radiotherapy gives no more clinically relevant information than the symptoms of the patient and we do not recommend routine chest X-rays for that reason.",Excluded
2387,"Role of p53 in the regulation of irradiation-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Wild-type p53 plays a crucial role in the control of apoptosis following ionizing radiation (IR); conversely, mutant p53 is associated with IR resistance. Although wild-type p53 is expressed in virtually all neuroblastoma tumors, treatment failures secondary to inadequate local control with radiotherapy are a problem in patients with advanced stage disease. This apparent paradox is the focus of our interest. The Shep-1 neuroblastoma cell line is highly resistant to IR. This cell line contains a wild-type p53 gene and is an ideal model for studying the mechanism of IR resistance in this disease. Following high-dose IR, cell fractionation demonstrated that p53 is induced and targeted to the nucleus. The induced p53 is functional as p53-responsive genes (Waf-1 and MDM-2) are appropriately induced following IR. Intriguingly, overexpression of p53 could reverse the inherent IR resistance of Shep-1 cells. Multiple cell lines expressing variable levels of exogenous temperature-sensitive p53 were generated. Pulse induction of p53 alone did not affect Shep-1 cell viability, while induction of p53, followed by IR, resulted in cell death and DNA fragmentation proportional to the dose of IR and the level of p53 expression. These findings demonstrate that p53 overexpression renders Shep-1 cells IR-sensitive and suggest that large quantities of exogenous p53 can overcome the factors inhibiting p53-mediated, IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded

Electroretinograms were recorded before and on day (D)1, D3, D8, D15, D22, and D29 after light exposure. The b-wave amplitude was plotted against log L (ganzfeld luminance), providing the b-wave sensitivity curve. The Naka-Rushton function fitted to the sensitivity curve enabled derivation of the parameters Bmax (saturated amplitude) and K (luminance-inducing Bmax/2). In addition, rats from each group were killed for retinal morphometric analyses.RESULTS: In the untreated group, light exposure caused collapse of the b-wave sensitivity curves. Bmax was reduced by 51% at D1 without subsequent recovery. K increased temporarily, reverting to normal values 8 days later. The outer nuclear layer thicknesses decreased markedly in the superior retina. In the treated groups, light exposure had a weaker effect on sensitivity curves. The values of Bmax were not significantly different from those in the unexposed-untreated group, although K increased temporarily.

ErbB2 (Her2) belongs to the family of EGF receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a vital oncogenic role in several cancers. Gliomas are reported to have aberrant overexpression of ErbB2, but its role in glioma biology and treatment resistance have not been well studied. We have previously reported that ionizing radiation (IR) increases cell invasiveness and radioresistance. In our preliminary studies, we observed that shRNA mediated ErbB2 silencing in glioma cell lines resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and invasion which was associated with a suppression of Notch signaling. To examine its role in radioresistance, we treated glioma cells with IR and observed that the cells exhibited a significant increase in invasiveness associated with nuclear translocation of ErbB2 and transcriptional upregulation of the Notch receptor ligand, Jagged-1. To further investigate the relationship between ErbB2 translocation and Notch signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation and transcription factor binding array studies in IR-treated cells which revealed an interesting association of nuclear ErbB2 with the TCF1/ LEF1 complex that is known to transcriptionally regulate Jagged-1 expression. In addition, chromatin-binding assays showed recruitment of ErbB2 to putative LEF1 consensus sites of the Jagged-1 promoter, suggesting a potential role for ErbB2 in the transcriptional regulation of Jagged-1 and consequently of Notch signaling after radiation in glioma cells. Further, downregulation of ErbB2 inhibited Notch signaling and decreased IR-induced invasion in these cells. These in vitro findings were further validated in an orthotopic intracranial glioma model that showed significant growth inhibition of intracranial ErbB2. shRNA-tumors compared to controls. Our results suggest a novel role for nuclear ErbB2 in regulating Jagged1/Notch1-signaling mediated cell invasion in IR treated cells, and provide a potential strategy for targeting ErbB2-mediated Notch signaling to overcome radioresistance in gliomas.",Excluded

Distinguishing tumor progression from radiation necrosis after treatment in patients with brain tumors presents a clinical dilemma. A well-characterized, orthotopic rodent model of radiation-induced brain necrosis including a tumor is not currently available The objective of the study was to create focal radiation necrosis in rat brain bearing human glioblastoma (GBM) using stereotactic radiosurgery and confirm it by immuno-histological analysis. Nude rats implanted with primary GBM cells were irradiated using a stereotactic setup (n = 3) or received no radiation (n = 3). Ten weeks after the implantation, growth of the tumor was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A treatment plan was generated using a 4 mm radiosurgery cone such that one portion of the tumor receives 100% dose of 60 Gy sufficient to cause necrosis, whereas the tumor edge at depth receives only 50% or less dose, allowing for regrowth of the tumor. The brains were collected 10 weeks after irradiation and immuno-histological analysis was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed central liquefaction necrosis in the high dose region consistent with necrosis and viable tumor in the peripheral low dose region.

1017,"Altered expression of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA in rat brain after photochemically induced focal ischemia. BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter glutamate is involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals must be removed rapidly from the synaptic cleft by high affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate transporters to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low to protect neuron from glutamate excitotoxicity, which is the major pathological mechanism of brain ischemia. GLAST is one of the identified four subtypes of the glutamate transporter system and has been suggested to play an important role in some pathological conditions. But until recently, very little information existed the concerning relationship between GLAST expression and cerebral ischemia.METHODS: Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was employed to evaluate the changes of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA expression in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus following photochemically induced focal cortical ischemia.RESULTS: GLAST mRNA expression in cerebral pyramid cells below the infarcted area did not change at 3 h, significantly decreased at 12 h, recovered to the control level at 24 h, and significantly increased at 72 h following the ischemic lesion. No changes in GLAST mRNA expression were observed in all subfields of the hippocampal complex.CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the time-course changes of GLAST mRNA expression after ischemia may be correlated with the pathogenesis of photosensitive ischemic brain damage.",Excluded

793,"Different mechanisms may generate sustained hypertonic and rhythmic bursting muscle activity in idiopathic dystonia. Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients with medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are largely unclear. In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes. In 5 dystonic patients with mobile involuntary movements, rhythmic EMG bursts in the contralateral muscles were coherent with the oscillations in the pallidal LFPs at the burst frequency. In contrast, no significant coherence was seen between EMG and LFPs either for the sustained activity separated out from the compound EMGs in those 5 cases, or in the EMGs in 3 other cases without mobile involuntary movements and rhythmic EMG bursts. In comparison with the resting condition, in both active and passive movements, significant modulation in the GPi LFPs was seen in the range of 8-16 Hz. The finding of significant coherence between GPi oscillations and rhythmic EMG bursts but not sustained tonic EMG activity suggests that the synchronized pallidal activity may be directly related to the rhythmic involuntary movements. In contrast, the sustained hypertonic muscle activity may be represented by less synchronized activity in the pallidum. Thus, the pallidum may play different roles in generating different components of the dystonic symptom complex.",Excluded

1993,"Qualitative assessment of intra-arterial cone beam CT angiography in precise anatomic localisation and treatment planning of intracranial and spinal arteriovenous fistulas. Background and Purpose Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is considered the standard for characterisation of intracranial/spinal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Although DSA offers superior spatial and temporal resolution, it is limited by 2D planar imaging. We directly paralleled DSA and intra-arterial cone-beam CT angiography (IACBCTA) modalities to assess the relative IACBCTA efficacy in the anatomical identification/localisation of AVFs and utility for surgical/endovascular treatment planning. Materials and Methods Patients with intracranial/spinal AVFs underwent biplane DSA and IACBCTA procedures (AXIOMArtis FlatDetector Biplane-Angiosuite, Siemens) at two institutions with identical contrast injection, radiation exposure, and postprocessing techniques. Images were reviewed retrospectively and independently by two neurointerventionalists on a de-identified PACS workstation. Observers were blinded to clinical information and reviewed both DSA and IACBCTA images in tandem, obtained from the same IA injection. Qualitative image analysis was performed based on the level of delineation on a scale of 1-3 (3: Excellent/Good with minimal attenuation; 2: Moderate, relevant visibility with restrictions; 1: Poor, nondiagnostic). The following parameters were scored: a) Arterial feeders, b) Venous drainers and course, c) Fistula site, d) Adjacent anatomical landmarks for cross-sectional localisation, and e) Overall diagnostic value for interpretation. Differences between the scores were defined as the IACBCTA efficacy value. For evaluation of IACBTA treatment planning efficacy, observers described the treatment strategy at the end of DSA and IACBCTA grading respectively and scored its adjunctive value: altered or more confident treatment plan versus no value. Wilcoxon signed rank test compared scores of image quality parameters. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Kendall W coefficient of concordance. Results Thirty-two consecutive patients [22M/10F, mean age 60.9 +/- 12.4 years (29-83 years)] were studied. Intracranial AVFs were classified as Cognard type I (n=3), type II (n=11), type III (n=3), type IV (n=1) and metameric dural/pial (n=5). Spinal AVFs were limited to Anson-Spetzler type I (n=9). Interobserver agreement of overall diagnostic value for IACBCTA was good (K = 0.59, P=0.001) while it was fair for IACBCTA overall efficacy value (K = 0.32, P=0.046); however, no significant difference was observed between two observers' IACBCTA efficacy values (P=0.3). Both observers assigned significantly higher scores to IACBCTA for overall diagnostic value (both observers: P<0.0001). No significant differences were observed between DSA and IACBCTA scores while evaluating arterial feeders (observer 1: P=1.0, observer 2: P=0.5) or venous drainers (observer 1: P=0.08, observer 2: P=0.1). Both readers assigned significantly higher scores to IACBCTA when evaluating the fistula site (observer 1: P <0.0001, observer 2: P=0.0003) and adjacent anatomic landmarks/cross-sectional localisation (both observers: P<0.0001). In 30/32 cases, both observers noted that IACBCTA did not alter the treatment plan; but provided a more confident endovascular or surgical treatment approach. Both observers altered their treatment plan from an endovascular approach to microsurgery in one case based on IACBCTA. Conclusion IACBCTA adjunctively improves the anatomical delineation of AVFs, particularly in terms of fistula site and localisation; biplane DSA may be equally sensitive for arterial feeder and venous drainer identification. IACBCTA confers a more confident endovascular or surgical approach when performed in conjunction with DSA.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Due to its role in learning, memory and in many neurodegenerative diseases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) represents an interesting endpoint to assess possible targets of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) generated by mobile phones. We investigated possible alterations of enzymatic activity, gene and protein expression of AChE in neuronal-like cells exposed to a 1.8 GHz Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modulated signal (217-GSM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat PC12 cells were exposed for 24 h to 1.8 GHz 217-GSM signal. Specific adsorption rate (SAR) was 2 W/kg. AChE enzyme activity was assessed spectrophotometrically by Ellman's method, mRNA expression level was evaluated by real time polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression was assessed by Western blotting.RESULTS: AChE enzymatic activity increased of 1.4-fold in PC12 cells exposed to 217-GSM signal for 24 h, whilst AChE transcriptional or translational pathways were not affected.CONCLUSION: Our results provide the first evidence of effects on AChE activity after in vitro exposure of mammalian cells to the RF-EMF generated by GSM mobile phones, at the SAR value 2 W/kg. The obtained evidence promotes further investigations on AChE as a possible target of RF-EMF and confirm the ability of 1.8 GHz 217-GSM signal to induce biological effects in different mammalian cells.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Although circular collimator arcs (CCA) and dynamic conformal arcs (DCA) are commonly used linear accelerator-based treatment planning techniques for intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of a small single lesion, these two techniques have not been rigorously compared in terms of tumor shape. Therefore, this study compared clinical CCA plans with re-planned DCA plans using conformity index (CI) and V12Gy (volume of normal brain tissue receiving 12 Gy or higher) from a perspective of asymmetry (Asym) of planning target volume (PTV).METHODS: Ninety-five clinical CCA plans delivered for a small single lesion with PTV size < 1.4 cm<sup>3</sup> were selected and re-planned using DCA. PTV Asym (%) was defined and calculated from three dimensions of PTV. A pair of the 95 plans was first considered as one group without grouping and then categorized into two groups with respective to either PTV size or PTV Asym, and four groups with respect to PTV size and PTV Asym. For grouping, median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were used. A non-parametric paired test was performed for CI and V12Gy to compare CCA and DCA plans in each group.RESULTS: Median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were 0.415 cm<sup>3</sup> (range: 0.076 cm<sup>3</sup>-1.369 cm<sup>3</sup>) and 6.12% (range: 0.52-25.74%), respectively. DCA plans had a lower average CI value than CCA plans for all groups. CCA plans had a smaller average V12Gy value than DCA plans for lesions with PTV Asym <=6.12%, while CCA and DCA plans had similar average V12Gy values for lesions with PTV Asym > 6.12%.CONCLUSIONS: The DCA technique is recommended when a lesion has PTV Asym > 6.12% regardless of PTV size. For lesions with PTV Asym <=6.12%, a technique choice would depend on the preference of CI or V12Gy.",Excluded

Background: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) patients exhibit a higher prevalence of thromboembolic complications. We hypothesized that in this malignancy, procoagulant and inflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of such complications and warfarin may down regulate these levels. Method(s): In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, patients with inoperable lung cancer (n=100) were randomized to receive chemotherapy and radiation with and without warfarin (INR 1.5 - 2.5). Blood samples were drawn prior to and after the 2nd treatment cycle with warfarin or control and retrospectively analyzed for microparticles and thrombin generation markers such as fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2). In addition, biochip array for C-reactive protein (CRP), D Dimer, neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured. The results were compared with a normal population (N=50). Result(s): The microparticles were markedly increased in the SCLC patients (3 fold increase) at baseline. Similary, the thrombin generation markers showed variable increase (1.5-3.2 fold increase). In the biochip array analysis, variable increase was noted. CRP (2.4 fold), D DIMER (11.6 fold), NSE (1.8 fold), NGAL (1.7 fold), TNFR1 (2 fold) and TM (1.3 fold) were all increased as compared to normal controls. All of the markers exhibited a decrease after warfarin treatment with a most pronounced decrease in the D Dimer and TNFR1. Conclusion(s): These results validate the hypothesis that SCLC patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state that is associated with simultaneous upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Warfarin treatment results in a down regulation of these mediators. Our results provide a rationale for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in this group of patients.",Excluded

3179,"Sodium sulfide selectively induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction and radiosensitizes glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Glioblastoma (GBM) has a poor prognosis despite intensive treatment with surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Previous studies using dose-escalated radiotherapy have demonstrated improved survival; however, increased rates of radionecrosis have limited its use. Development of radiosensitizers could improve patient outcome. In the present study, we report the use of sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S), a hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) donor, to selectively kill GBM cells (T98G and U87) while sparing normal human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Na<sub>2</sub>S also decreased mitochondrial respiration, increased oxidative stress and induced gammaH2AX foci and oxidative base damage in GBM cells. Since Na<sub>2</sub>S did not significantly alter T98G capacity to perform non-homologous end-joining or base excision repair, it is possible that GBM cell killing could be attributed to increased damage induction due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, Na<sub>2</sub>S enhanced mitochondrial respiration, produced a more reducing environment and did not induce high levels of DNA damage in hCMEC/D3. Taken together, this data suggests involvement of mitochondrial respiration in Na<sub>2</sub>S toxicity in GBM cells. The fact that survival of LN-18 GBM cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho<sup>0</sup>) was not altered by Na<sub>2</sub>S whereas the survival of LN-18 rho<sup>+</sup> cells was compromised supports this conclusion. When cells were treated with Na<sub>2</sub>S and photon or proton radiation, GBM cell killing was enhanced, which opens the possibility of H<sub>2</sub>S being a radiosensitizer. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that H<sub>2</sub>S donors could be used in GBM therapy to potentiate radiation-induced killing.",Excluded
3578,"Characterization of skin reactions and pain reported by patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer at different sites. BACKGROUND: Skin reactions and pain are commonly reported side effects of radiation therapy (RT).OBJECTIVE: To characterize RT-induced symptoms according to treatment site subgroups and identify skin symptoms that correlate with pain.METHODS: A self-report survey-adapted from the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and the McGill Pain Questionnaire--assessed RT-induced skin problems, pain, and specific skin symptoms. Wilcoxon Sign Ranked tests compared mean severity or pre- and post-RT pain and skin problems within each RT-site subgroup. Multiple linear regression (MLR) investigated associations between skin symptoms and pain.RESULTS: Survey respondents (N = 106) were 58% female and on average 64 years old. RT sites included lung, breast, lower abdomen, head/neck/brain, and upper abdomen. Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in treatment site pain and skin problems (P < or = .007). Patients receiving head/neck/brain RT reported increased skin problems (P < .0009). MLR showed that post-RT skin tenderness and tightness were most strongly associated with post-RT pain (P = .066 and P = .122, respectively).LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, exploratory analyses, and nonvalidated measure.CONCLUSIONS: Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in pain and skin problems at the RT site while patients receiving head/neck/brain RT had increased skin problems but not pain. These findings suggest that the severity of skin problems is not the only factor that contributes to pain and that interventions should be tailored to specifically target pain at the RT site, possibly by targeting tenderness and tightness. These findings should be confirmed in a larger sampling of RT patients.",Excluded
1934,"Modulation of acute coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis in gamma-irradiated rats by transfer of naive lymphocyte subsets before infection. Clinical course, recovery of infectious virus from brain tissue and histopathology of the central nervous system were examined in gamma-irradiated Lewis rats reconstituted by naive lymphocytes before infection with coronavirus MHV-4 (strain JHM). Up to 9 days past infection, no differences were seen between immunologically competent and immuno-deficient animals in terms of onset and progression of neurological disease. However, in the latter animals neurological symptoms were dominated by signs of encephalitis instead of paralytic disease as usually seen in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, despite high titers of infectious virus in the CNS of immunodeficient animals only mild histopathological changes were noticeable. In contrast, infectious virus in the CNS of immunologically competent animals was below the detection limit of the assay. Paralytic disease and tissue destruction were T lymphocyte mediated because gamma-irradiated rats that were reconstituted by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte enriched cells in the absence of B lymphocytes revealed an earlier onset of clinical symptoms and a more rapid deterioration of their clinical state compared to fully competent animals. Whereas in CD4+ T cell reconstituted animals infectious virus was moderately reduced and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory changes in the CNS were focal, in CD8+ T cell reconstituted animals vacuolizing white matter inflammation was diffuse without reduction of infectious virus in brain tissue. From the presented data we conclude that in the acute stage of JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats: (i) tissue destruction and paralytic clinical symptomatology are mainly T cell-mediated; (ii) CD4+ T lymphocytes can directly contribute to reduction of viral load in the brain and (iii) only coordinated action of both, the T and the B cell compartment enables animals to survive the infection and recover from disease.",Excluded
301,"Goniometric measurement for the estimation of anisotropy coefficient of human and animal pancreas. Estimation of optical properties of biologic tissues is determinant for laser dosimetry in medical applications. Tissues highly absorb and scatter the light in near infrared spectrum, where the laser provides therapeutic effects. Novel frontiers of clinical practice, e.g., the employment of laser light for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, require information about pancreas-laser interaction, which are crucial for therapy management. The property of biological tissues to scatter the light traveling through is described by the anisotropy coefficient (g). The relationship between g and the angular distribution of the scattered light is described by Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The measurement of angular distribution of scattered light is performed by the goniometric technique. This paper describes the estimation of g of ex vivo pancreas at 1064 nm, performed by a goniometric-based system, where a photodetector measures intensities of scattered light at fixed angles between -120degree and 120degree. A two-term Henyey-Greenstein phase function has been employed to estimate anisotropy coefficient for forward (gfs) and backward scattering (gbs). Experimental trails were performed to assess the repeatability of measurement system: percentage value of standard deviation is generally lower than 8% for angles higher (lower) than 13degree (13degree). Measurements were performed for the first time on healthy swine pancreas, aiming to investigate the influence of coagulation temperature: gfs decreases from 0.94 (at 25 degreeC) to 0.93 (at 80 degreeC). Afterwards, the same set up has been employed for the estimation of g of human pancreas affected by neuroendocrine tumor, which presented an estimated values for gfs of 0.89.",Excluded

The number of Abeta plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1beta, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Abeta burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task.RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Abeta plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy x 10), 72% (2 Gy x 5) and 78% (2 Gy x 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001). The reduction in Abeta burden (2 Gy x 5) was associated with cognitive improvement (p=0.012).CONCLUSION: This is the first report that a clinically relevant course of external beam irradiation (2 Gy x 5) produces a significant reduction in AD-associated amyloid-beta plaques with a subsequent improvement in cognitive function. However, longer-term studies are needed to define the precise underlying mechanism and longevity of this response.",Excluded
1682,"InterCardioRisk: a novel online tool for estimating doses of ionising radiation to occupationally-exposed medical staff and their associated health risks. Those working in interventional cardiology and related medical procedures are potentially subject to considerable exposure to x-rays. Two types of tissue of particular concern that may receive considerable doses during such procedures are the lens of the eye and the brain. Ocular radiation exposure results in lens changes that, with time, may progress to partial or total lens opacification (cataracts). In the early stages, such opacities do not result in visual disability; the severity of such changes tends to increase progressively with dose and time until vision is impaired and cataract surgery is required. Scattered radiation doses to the eye lens of an interventional cardiologist in typical working conditions can exceed 34 muGy min<sup>-1</sup> in high-dose fluoroscopy modes and 3 muGy per image during image acquisition (instantaneous rate values) when radiation protection tools are not used. A causal relation between exposure to ionising radiation and increased risk of brain and central nervous system tumours has been shown in a number of studies. Although absorbed doses to the brain in interventional cardiology procedures are lower than those to the eye lens by a factor between 3.40 and 8.08 according to our simulations, doses to both tissues are among the highest occupational radiation doses documented for medical staff whose work involves exposures to x-rays.

2232,"The role of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer. Brain is the most common site of metastatic spread in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Approximately 10% of SCLC patients have brain metastases (BM) already at diagnosis and an additional 40% will develop central nervous system (CNS) involvement during their disease course. Although whole brain radiotherapy and corticosteroids is considered the treatment of choice, accumulating evidence suggests that systemic chemotherapy may also play an important role. The concept of the brain as a pharmacologic sanctuary site for established metastases is in contrast with recent clinical observations of frequent BM responses with systemic chemotherapy. During the last decade, several reports about the effect of systemic chemotherapy on BM from SCLC have been published. Pooled data from five studies report 66% response rate (RR) in 64 patients with initial BM. In addition, an average RR of 36% is derived from five studies including 135 patients with delayed BM treated with systemic single agent chemotherapy. Among new drugs with activity in patients with SCLC brain metastases, camptothecin analog topotecan is one of the most promising with a 52% RR. Although whole brain radiation remains the standard treatment of established BM in SCLC there is an emerging role for systemic chemotherapy, particularly with the use of new active drugs as part of combined modality treatments.

1314,"Astroglial swelling in the neuronal depolarization ensemble. The coupling between neuronal depolarization and astroglial swelling was examined. First, previous in vitro data for the swelling of cultured neurons (N18; rat neuroblastoma) and astroglia (C6; rat astroglyoma) upon exposure to a hypoosmotic solution were reappraised. Neurons swelled rapidly, forming blisters, and easily burst. whereas astroglia resisted swelling and slowly assumed a large full-moon shape. The time constant of swelling was 35.2 +/- 7.8 s for N18 and 594.8 +/- 554.0 s for C6. The glial plasmic membrane was found to be much stronger than the neuronal one, presumably due to a well-developed cytoskeleton. To overcome such neuronal membranous weakness, strong astroglial processes need to cover the neurons including the cell body and synapses, as demonstrated electron-microscopically. Next, in situ astroglial swelling was investigated in rats. During K(+)-induced cortical spreading depression, increases or decreases of a wave-ring spread of light (550 nm) transmission through a 1 mm-thick cerebral cortical layer was observed. The moving local optical density decrease in the cortex was attributable to local vascular bed compression induced by astroglial swelling, since concomitant occurrence of colocated dynamic capillary flow stall was confirmed by a hemodilution technique. Astroglial swelling may occur in an ensemble acting during neuronal depolarization, suggesting that neurons and astroglia behave like a unit complex.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on the antioxidant enzymatic system (such as GPx, GR and SOD), GSH and selenium level in liver, kidney, muscle and brain of static magnetic field (SMF) exposed rats. Male adult rats were divided into control rats (n=6), SMF-exposed rats (128 mT; 1h/day for 5 days), selenium-treated rats (Na(2)SeO(3), 0.2mg/l, in drinking water for 4 weeks) and co-exposed rats (selenium for 4 weeks and SMF during the last 5 consecutive days). Sub-acute exposure to SMF induces a decrease of selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain. Our results also revealed a decrease of GPx activities in kidney and muscle. By contrast, SMF exposure increased total GSH levels and total SOD activities in liver, while glutathione reductase activity is unaffected. Selenium supplementation in SMF-exposed rats restored selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain and elevated the activities of GPx in kidney and muscle to those of control group. In the liver, selenium supplementation failed to bring down the elevated levels of total GSH and SOD activity.

The dark-adapted current-voltage (I-V) curve of a ventral photoreceptor cell of Limulus, measured by a voltage-clamp technique, has a high slope-resistance region more negative than resting voltage, a lower slope-resistance region between resting voltage and zero, and a negative slope-resistance region more positive than 0 v. With illumination, we find no unique voltage at which there is no light-induced current. At the termination of illumination, the I-V curve changes quickly, then recovers very slowly to a dark-adapted configuration. The voltage-clamp currents during and after illumination can be interpreted to arise from two separate processes. One process (fast) changes quickly with change in illumination, has a reversal potential at +20 mv, and has an I-V curve with positive slope resistance at all voltages. These properties are consistent with a light-induced change in membrane conductance to sodium ions. The other process (slow) changes slowly with changes in illumination, generates light-activated current at +20 mv, and has an I-V curve with a large region of negative slope resistance. The mechanism of this process cannot as yet be identified.",Excluded

The loading schemes included no intervention, wearing a penguin suit, sleeping in a fetal position, wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position, reclining for 4 or 16 h/d, and maintaining upright posture for 4 or 16 h/d. <b>RESULTS:</b> Without intervention, the microgravity environment led to increased central pore pressure, radial displacement, and water content in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position can reduce disc pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content to 0.156 MPa, 11.50 kPa, 0.538 mm, and 1.390%, respectively. When astronauts return to the gravity environment, staying upright for 4 h can reduce the pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content of the intervertebral disc to 0.222 MPa, 10.72 kPa, 0.373 mm, and 0.219%, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study showed that wearing a penguin suit and sleeping in the fetal position both have the potential to protect the lumbar intervertebral disc from the negative effects caused by microgravity.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures reflecting the health of neurons (total macular volume, TMV) and axons (retinal nerve fibre layer, RNFL) relate to MRI-derived measures of myelin (myelin water fraction, MWF) in the optic radiation (OR) of individuals with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) compared to healthy controls. BACKGROUND: NMO is an autoimmune disorder characterized by episodes of inflammation and damage to astrocytes that can result in optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis. The optic nerve is a frequent site for demyelination resulting in visual dysfunction which may be reflected by OCT measures of axonal health and MWF of the OR. DESIGN/METHODS: 8 eyes with ON (NMO<sup>1</sup>) and 12 eyes without ON (NMO<sup>2</sup>) from ten NMO patients (EDSS 2.06.0, mean age=43y, 3M/7F) and 24 eyes of twelve healthy subjects (mean age=31y, 3M/9F) were included. OCT assessment involved a Macular Volume protocol (volume of retina in the center 6mm of the macula) and a RNFL Thickness scan (3.4mm ring scan of retinal thickness around optic nerve). The MRI protocol included a 32-echo T2-relaxation GRASE sequence. Average MWF values were calculated within the OR. RESULT(S): RNFL thickness (NMO<sup>1</sup>:70.5+/-17.9mum; NMO<sup>2</sup>:91.3+/-8.7mum; controls:102.9+/-15.0mum) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.01) and controls (p<0.0001). TMV (NMO<sup>1</sup>:7.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; NMO<sup>2</sup>:8.4+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; controls:8.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.02) and controls (p<0.0001). Also NMO<sup>2</sup> had reduced TMV compared to controls (p=0.02). Decreased OR MWF was also observed in NMO (NMO:0.098+/-0.01; controls:0.11+/-0.01, p=0.02). There was a strong correlation between the OR MWF and RNFL (r=0.50,p=0.003) and TMV (r=0.60,p=0.0002). CONCLUSION(S): The correspondence between reductions in OCT measures of neuronal and axonal health in the anterior visual pathway and MRI-based measures of myelin health in the posterior visual pathway suggests that these measures may be used to evaluate disease progression and treatment approaches that promote repair.",Excluded
1196,"Optimal arc selection from class solution geometries for solitary intra-cranial radiotherapy. Objectives: Preliminary planning at our institution using HyperArcTM (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) identified the optimal beam energy of 10 MVFFF. Evidence suggests that single target plans do not require as many arcs as single isocentre, multiple target plans but there are trade-offs.1,2 The aim of this study was to determine the optimal arc selection from HyperArcs class solution beam geometries for post-surgical cavities for stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Method(s): For 16 retrospective solitary post-surgical cavity cases, HyperArc plans comprising different arc geometries were generated. Prescribed dose for all plans was 24 Gy in 3 fractions with D99% >= utilising 10 MVFFF. Metrics analysed including indices: CI100 RTOG, CI50 RTOG, CI Paddick, GI Paddick, HI (ICRU 83) and plan complexity using modulation factor (MF) (MU/dose per fraction in cGy) comparing default arc selection versus varying arc selections. Result(s): The mean CI100 RTOG for default arc selection was 1.10 (1.03-1.25) compared to 1.11 (1.05-1.24) for the comparison plans. The mean CI50 RTOG for default arc selection was 3.24 (2.70-5.44) compared to 3.25 (2.79-4.46) for the comparison plans. The mean MF for default arc selection was 2.74 (2.40-3.40) compared to 2.76 (2.40-4.00) for the comparison plans. Results from the complete analysis to be presented with additional metrics. Discussion/Conclusion: Analysis highlighted minimal differences when comparing default arc selection to varying arc selection. Due to no clear benefit for either groups of plans, consideration in the decision making was given to both treatment time and isocentre verification at individual couch angles. Therefore, minimising arc angles for solitary intra-cranial lesions was the preferred option.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to calculate the radiation absorbed dose to kidneys, liver, spleen, pituitary gland, and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of patients treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. METHOD(S): We enrolled 61 patients (male/female patients, 40/21) with mean age of 48.1 +/- 15.3 years affected by different types of NETs diagnosed with Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT and biochemical markers. For radiation protection of kidneys, amino acid mixture (lysine and arginine) was coinfused; 3.7 to 7.4 GBq (100-200 mCi) of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE was infused to each patient over 30 minutes. Each patient underwent a series of 9 whole-body scans at 30 minutes (prevoid) and 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, and 168 h. The organs included in dosimetric calculation were kidney, liver, spleen, pituitary gland, and NETs. All dosimetric calculations were done using the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. RESULT(S): Physiological uptake of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE was seen in all patients in kidneys, liver, spleen, and pituitary gland. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated: 0.57 +/- 0.09 mGy/MBq for kidneys, 0.27 +/- 0.05 mGy/MBq for liver, 1.17 +/- 0.14 mGy/MBq for spleen, 0.058 +/- 0.011 mGy/MBq for pituitary gland, and 3.41 +/- 0.68 mGy/MBq for NETs. CONCLUSION(S): The maximum cumulative activity of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE that can be safely administered to a patient within permissible renal threshold in our study was found to be 40 GBq (1100 mCi). However, there are considerable interpatient differences in absorbed doses of all organs requiring individualized dosimetry for optimizing tumor dose.",Excluded
2338,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging as an evaluation of the response of brain metastases treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Background: Loss of tumor cell results in a relative increase in extracellular space that may lead to alteration of ADC. Our purpose was to see if the ADC could be used, rather than methods depending on changes in tumor size, to predict treatment success after treatment of brain metastases with SRS. Method(s): In a prospective study, the ADCs of 21 patients with 32 solid or solid-dominated brain metastases were taken before and 1 week, 1 month, and at 3-month intervals after SRS. Mean ADC values at the various time intervals were compared with each other to see whether or not the ADC might be used as an early indicator of treatment success or failure. Result(s): The mean pretreatment value of the ADC in the metastatic tumors was 1.05 +/- 0.12 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (mean +/- SD). This value for the tumors rose significantly (P = .009) 7 days after SRS and continued to rise with time. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that 91% of these tumors had been controlled by the SRS. The ADC values in cystic/necrotic tumor tissue (2.13 +/- 0.18 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) were significantly (P < .001) higher than those in noncentral necrotic tumor tissue (1.61 +/- 0.14 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s). Conclusion(s): The ADC values might eventually be useful to evaluate treatment success-and in some patients, detected even at early time points-and to distinguish radiation-induced central necrosis from tumor regrowth in cases where other imagery is not definitive. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

2138,"Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions and Intracranial Pressure During CSF Infusion Testing. BACKGROUND: A noninvasive method to monitor changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) is required for astronauts on long-duration spaceflight who are at risk of developing the Visual Impairment/Intracranial Pressure syndrome that has some, but not all of the features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We assessed the validity of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to detect changes in ICP.METHODS: Subjects were eight patients undergoing medically necessary diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion testing for hydrocephalus. DPOAE measurements were obtained with an FDA-approved system at baseline and six controlled ICP levels in ~3 mmHg increments in random order, with a range from 10.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg (SD) at baseline to 32.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg (SD) at level 6.RESULTS: For f2 frequencies between 800 and 1700 Hz, when ICP was >= 12 mmHg above baseline ICP, DPOAE angles increased significantly and DPOAE magnitudes decreased significantly, but less robustly.DISCUSSION: Significant changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude are seen when ICP is >= 12 mmHg above a subject's supine baseline ICP during CSF infusion testing. These results suggest that the changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude seen with change in ICP are physiologically based, and suggest that it should be possible to detect pathological ICP elevation using DPOAE measurements. To use DPOAE for noninvasive estimation of ICP during spaceflight will require baseline measurements in the head-up, supine, and head-down positions to obtain baseline DPOAE values at different ICP ranges.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate white matter (WM) abnormalities induced by WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients (11 men and 13 women; age range 38-74 years, median 60 years) who survived for more than 1 year after completion of WBRT (radiation dose range 30-40 Gy, median 35 Gy) at our institution between January 2000 and June 2003 were followed up with magnetic resonance (MR) scans for 11-51 months (median 19 months). We evaluated WM changes attributable to WBRT as grade 0-6 and assessed possible contributing factors by statistical analysis.RESULTS: WM changes were found in 20 patients: Eight were assessed as grade 2, three as grade 3, and nine as grade 5. In total, 12 patients developed grade 3 or higher WM changes. Age (<60 vs > or =60 years), sex, radiation dose (< or =35 vs >35 Gy), chemotherapy (with CDDP vs without CDDP), biologically effective dose (< or =120 vs >120 Gy1), and head width (<16.3 vs > or =16.3 cm) were found not to be relevant to the incidence or severity of the WM changes.CONCLUSION: Long-term survivors who have under-gone WBRT may have a higher incidence of WM abnormalities.",Excluded
3613,"Incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing drugs. BACKGROUND: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs.METHODS: four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.",Excluded
713,"Ontogeny of light-induced decrease of N-acetyltransferase activity in explanted chick pineal glands. The ontogeny of chick pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity was investigated in explanted chick pineal glands at 4, 10 and 21 d of age. Nocturnal levels of the enzyme and the response of the enzyme to light exposure were determined in pineal glands maintained in short-term culture at each age. The results indicate that nocturnal NAT activity was increased in the glands from older birds. Nocturnal levels of NAT activity at the time of the initiation of the experiment were threefold greater in glands from 21-d-old birds as compared to that in glands from 4-day-old chicks. The response to light was similar in all three ages examined; light induced a significant decrease in NAT activity within 60 min in explanted glands from 4-d-old chicks and within 180 min in the glands from the 10- and 21-d-old chicks. A paradoxical transient increase in enzyme activity occurred immediately (within 5 min) following light exposure which was significant in the glands from the youngest chicks, and present, but more variable, in the older chicks. These data indicate that the nocturnal enzyme activity is greater in glands from older birds, but that light exposure of explanted glands initiates a transient rise followed by a decrease in NAT activity at all three ages.",Excluded
2858,"[Treatment of vesico-enteric fistulae in men. Pedicled bladder flap]. Genitourinary fistulae represent a rare condition for patients submitted to salvage radiotherapy due to local tumour relapse after radical prostatectomy. Nevertheless, it is associated with great morbidity and in many cases with repetitive surgeries limiting their quality of life. Many techniques have been proposed to reduce the incidence of early and late postsurgical complications, but up to now a safe and unique method to treat this disease has not been reported in the literature. Here we report on three cases of male patients who developed a vesicoenteric fistula after radiation salvage therapy following radical prostatectomy. A rotation bladder flap was used to cover the pelvic floor attempting to reduce the common complications. All of the patients underwent a urinary diversion and a protective colostomy. The 1-year follow-up showed good postsurgical outcomes with minor early complications and no signs of intestinal obstruction or recurrent fistula. Furthermore, perineal and pelvic pain improvement was also achieved. The small number of cases is a limiting factor in defining standard techniques for the treatment of actinic vesicoenteric fistulae. Nevertheless, the use of a rotational bladder flap for repair of the pelvic floor defect has shown promising results and should be indicated in special situations.",Excluded
2634,"Simulation of reflected light intensity changes during navigation and radio-frequency lesioning in the brain. An electrode with adjacent optical fibers for measurements during navigation and radio frequency lesioning in the brain is modeled for Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in brain tissue. Relative reflected light intensity at 780 nm, I780, from this electrode and probes with identical fiber configuration are simulated using the intensity from native white matter as reference. Models are made of homogeneous native and coagulated gray, thalamus, and white matter as well as blood. Dual layer models, including models with a layer of cerebrospinal fluid between the fibers and the brain tissue, are also made. Simulated I780 was 0.16 for gray matter, 0.67 for coagulate gray matter, 0.36 for thalamus, 0.39 for coagulated thalamus, unity for white matter, 0.70 for coagulated white matter, and 0.24 for blood. Thalamic matter is also found to reflect more light than gray matter and less than white matter in clinical studies. In conclusion, the reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between gray and white matter during navigation. Furthermore, coagulation of light gray tissue, such as the thalamus, might be difficult to detect using I780, but coagulation in darker gray tissue should result in a rapid increase of I780.",Excluded
890,"Effectiveness of a 1-day aspiration plus Gamma Knife surgery procedure for metastatic brain tumor with a cystic component. OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has gained increasing relevance in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors, but many metastatic tumors contain a large cystic component and often exceed the size limit for GKS. For such lesions, the authors adopted a procedure in which stereotactic aspiration is first performed and followed immediately by GKS on the same day. In this paper, the authors describe this 1-day combined procedure and evaluate its efficacy.METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 25 cystic metastases in 25 patients were treated at Dokkyo Medical University. The patients first underwent MRI and stereotactic aspiration of the cyst while stationary in a Leksell stereotactic frame; immediately afterward, the patients underwent a second MR imaging session and Gamma Knife treatment. Tumor volume reduction, tumor control rate, and overall survival were examined.RESULTS: Tumor volume, including the cystic component, decreased from 8.0-64.2 cm(3) (mean 20.3 cm(3)) to 3.0-36.2 cm(3) (mean 10.3 cm(3)) following aspiration, and the volume of 24 of 25 lesions decreased to less than 16.6 cm(3), which is equivalent to the volume of a 3.16-cm sphere. At least 20 Gy was delivered to the entire lesion in 24 of 25 cases. Good tumor control was obtained in 16 of 21 cases that could be evaluated during a median follow-up period of 11 months (range 1-27 months); however, reaccumulation of cyst contents was observed in 2 patients who required Ommaya reservoir placement.CONCLUSIONS: The 1-day aspiration plus GKS procedure is an effective and time-efficient treatment for large cystic brain metastases.",Excluded
494,"Reducing the dosimetric impact of positional errors in field junctions for craniospinal irradiation using VMAT. AIM: To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose profile in treatment field overlap regions.BACKGROUND: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position during the treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like dose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised first, with dose prescription explicitly enforcing a ramp-like dose profile. The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the dose contribution of the upper spinal fields.RESULTS: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a) widening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set-up.",Excluded

1643,"(R)-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, enhances tonic GABA inhibition in rat hippocampus. Pharmacological agents that mediate a persistent GABAergic conductance are of considerable interest for treatment of epilepsy. (R)-roscovitine is a membrane permeable cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, designed to block cell division. It is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial as an anticancer drug. We show that (R)-roscovitine increases a tonic GABA-mediated current in rat hippocampal neurons. This enhanced tonic current appears independent of synaptic GABA release and requires functional transmembrane GABA transport. The effect of (R)-roscovitine is associated with neither modification of GABAA receptors nor protein kinase activity, but is associated with a significant increase in intracellular GABA concentration in hippocampal GABAergic neurons. (R)-roscovitine-induced tonic inhibition significantly suppresses spontaneous spiking activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, (R)-roscovitine is a potent modulator of neuronal activity in rat hippocampus and may provide a tool for preventing paroxysmal activity.",Excluded
1678,"Dose-dependent effects of small-vessel disease MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and structural connectivity. Background: MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, and microbleeds are related to cognitive dysfunction in subjects with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Previous studies have usually focused on the location of these vascular markers and did not consider the concomitant effect by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this study, we aimed to find dose-dependent effects of these MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in VCI patients, considering the effect by concomitant AD pathology. Method(s): Participants consisted of 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI) and 69 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Conventional brain MRI scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and PIB PET were performed. WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and PIB retention amount were measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to elucidate the relationship between regional cortical thickness, DTI abnormalities, and each small vessel vascular marker, adjusting the effects by demographic factors and PIB retention amount. Result(s): Higher WMH volume was associated with cortical thinning in bilateral cingulate cortices, right insular cortex, and left lingual gyrus. More lacunes were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial and superior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Microbleeds were not related with regional cortical thinning. Higher PIB retention was associated with cortical thinning in left medial temporal lobe. Independent of other vascular markers and PIB retention amount, larger WMH volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread periventricular white matter region. Regardless of PIB retention amount, more lacunes were associated with decreased FA in bilateral posterior and anterior corona radiata, right anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, and bilateral precuneus. Microbleeds had association with decreased FA in the bilateral posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. PIB retention amount was not related with regional FA decrease. The association between neuropsychological scores and vascularmarkers were generally compatible with findings from cortical thickness and DTI analyses. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that small vessel vascular markers in VCI patients are related with regional cortical thinning and white matter abnormalities in a dosedependent manner regardless of AD pathology.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To report on bevacizumab treatment for radiation retinopathy affecting the macula.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with radiation retinopathy (edema, hemorrhages, capillary dropout, and neovascularization) and a subjective or objective loss of vision were treated. Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) every 6-12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography.RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema. Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18). Three patients discontinued therapy. Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2). Three patients (14%) regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity. No ocular or systemic bevacizumab-related side effects were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to treat radiation retinopathy. In most cases treatment was associated with decreased vascular leakage, stabilization, or improved vision.

1367,"Biopsy of enlarging lesions after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases frequently reveals radiation necrosis. Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers excellent local control for brain metastases (BM) with low rates of toxicity. Radiation necrosis (RN) may occur after treatment and is challenging to distinguish from local recurrence (LR). We evaluated enlarging brain lesions following SRS that were subsequently biopsied to differentiate RN versus LR.Methods: This study reviewed patients receiving SRS for BM between 2008 and 2012 who underwent a biopsy for suspicion of RN versus LR on MRI. Data collection included demographics, radiation parameters, imaging findings, and post-biopsy pathology. Kaplan-Meier methods determined overall survival. Fisher's exact test assessed for association between lesion biopsy result and variables of interest.Results: Thirty-four patients with 35 biopsied BM were included. Lesions were biopsied a median of 8.8 months after SRS. Most patients had primary lung cancer (11; 31.4%). Eleven (31.4%) biopsies were positive for LR and 24 (68.6%) showed RN only. Median overall survival was longer for patients with RN (31.0 mo) than for patients with LR (14.5 mo; P = 0.135). Time from SRS to biopsy was significantly different between RN and LR groups; 10 lesions (52.5%) biopsied <=9 months after SRS showed LR, whereas 1 lesion (6.3%) biopsied >9 months after SRS showed LR (P = 0.004). For 16 (65.7%) lesions, management was changed or directed by the biopsy results.Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy for accessible enlarging lesions after SRS appears diagnostically valuable in patients with few lesions and changes clinical management. RN should be suspected in patients with an enlarging lesion more than 9 months post-SRS.",Excluded

2697,"Prospective Peer Review for Patients Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Intracranial Radiosurgery in a Multi-Site Community-Setting is Both Feasible and Effective. Purpose/Objective(s): Delivery of stereotactic radiation requires a level of quality assurance beyond traditional fractionation given the impact of misdelivery. While efforts to improve peer review at academic centers have been reported, very few guidelines exist in the literature for implementation of a program with more intensive review of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or intracranial radiosurgery (SRS) in a community-based setting. Here, we report on the logistics as well as the first 260 cases reviewed in one year of a pilot program at a community-based multi-location network of radiation oncology facilities. Materials/Methods: We implemented a departmental process at four network radiation facilities affiliated with an academic institution that no SBRT or SRS case could be treated without a second physician approving the contours and plan prior to delivery of the first fraction. Coincident with this process, we began an SBRT/SRS peer review rounds for 30-60 minutes per week. Ideally, cases were reviewed initially for contour approval including targets, organs at risk (OAR), image registration, and overall directive/modality selection. Cases approved in this phase progressed to planning and were reviewed the following week for final peer approval. Cases with more urgent turnaround times, particularly intracranial radiosurgery, were often required to be reviewed outside of rounds by a second physician. Recommendations for changes in both the contouring/directive review phase and the planning phase were collected prospectively. Changes were designated major changes retrospectively by the physician team if the change materially altered the final plan. Result(s): From March 2019 to February 2020, 260 cases were treated with SBRT or SRS in our network. 56 cases (21.5%) had a change recommendation. 19 (7%) cases had a major revision. 95% (53 cases) of changes detected by this program were during the contouring/intent phase of planning with only 5% (3 cases) requiring revision at the planning phase or at treatment delivery. Most common deviations detected tracked closely with cases reported in the ASTRO RO-ILS system such as OAR (35%) and target revisions (18%), minor prescription adjustments (25%) and prior radiation dose not accounted for (9%). Near universal prospective peer review of stereotactic cases (99.5%) was accomplished using this system. Conclusion(s): Here, we demonstrate that prospective peer review is both feasible and results in a significant number of changes - 21.5% of cases reviewed. Major changes that materially altered the plan occurred in 19 of 260 cases (7%). This system allowed for near universal prospective peer review of these cases with no significant delay in planning or treatment with a low burden on physicians and staff of approximately 1 hour per week per physician. Prospective peer review also resulted in very few re-planned cases in the post-planning phase including plan check and changes discovered at the time of treatment delivery (1% overall).

This review will discuss our main results and related researches for understanding of muscle spindle activities during microgravity environment, which may provide a theoretic basis for effective prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy induced by weightlessness.",Excluded
2282,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapies (PRRTs): Which are the dosimetric data for the patients?. Introduction: NeuroEndocrine Tumours (NETs) belong to a relatively rare class of neoplasms. Nonetheless, their prevalence has increased significantly during the last decades. Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) therapeutic effect is based on the binding of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue peptides with NETs' somatostatin receptors, resulting in internal irradiation of tumours. Pre-therapeutic patient-specific dosimetry is essential for a treatment course with high levels of safety and efficacy. This study reviews the methods and dosimetric results of PRRT dosimetry presented in the literature. Focus is given on data concerning the therapeutic somatostatin analogue radiopeptides <sup>111</sup>In-[DTPA<sup>0</sup>,DPhe<sup>1</sup>]- octreotide (<sup>111</sup>In-DTPA-octreotide), <sup>90</sup>Y-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC) and <sup>177</sup>Lu-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>,Thr<sup>8</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE). Material(s) and Method(s): This study included papers that have performed dosimetry in adult patients for the therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals <sup>111</sup>In- DTPA-octreotide, <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC and <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. Furthermore, papers presented herein were published during the last 15 years (1999 - 2013), with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE studies being published during the last 4 years (2010 - 2013). Additionally, selection was limited to papers providing dosimetric data for at least two regions of interest. Result(s): Dosimetric results are provided for tumors, kidneys, red marrow, liver and spleen, Following Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee formalism, dosimetric analysis demonstrates large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake, with kidneys and bone marrow being the critical organs. Results are dependent on the image acquisition and processing protocol, as well as the dosimetric imaging radiopharmaceutical. Discussion(s): The large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake stresses the need for personalized therapy planning. Patient-specific dosimetry in PRRT is therefore needed, in order for the fixed dose regimens to be replaced with patient-tailored therapy planning. Kidney absorbed doses are higher in PRRT with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, allowing for higher <sup>177</sup>Lu activities to be administered in <sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE therapies. In order for such dosimetric techniques to be systematically implemented in a busy clinical environment, dosimetry software programmes may provide an essential tool, as they help in making the procedures less time-intensive.",Excluded
2017,"Purkinje-cell-restricted restoration of Kv3.3 function restores complex spikes and rescues motor coordination in Kcnc3 mutants. The fast-activating/deactivating voltage-gated potassium channel Kv3.3 (Kcnc3) is expressed in various neuronal cell types involved in motor function, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13) patients carrying dominant-negative mutations in Kcnc3 and Kcnc3-null mutant mice both display motor incoordination, suggested in mice by increased lateral deviation while ambulating and slips on a narrow beam. Motor skill learning, however, is spared. Mice lacking Kcnc3 also exhibit muscle twitches. In addition to broadened spikes, recordings of Kcnc3-null Purkinje cells revealed fewer spikelets in complex spikes and a lower intraburst frequency. Targeted reexpression of Kv3.3 channels exclusively in Purkinje cells in Kcnc3-null mice as well as in mice also heterozygous for Kv3.1 sufficed to restore simple spike brevity along with normal complex spikes and to rescue specifically coordination. Therefore, spike parameters requiring Kv3.3 function in Purkinje cells are involved in the ataxic null phenotype and motor coordination, but not motor learning.",Excluded
311,"Stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife radiosurgery of cystic brain metastasis. Object. Treatment options for patients with brain metastasis include tumor resection, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery. A single treatment is not useful in cases of multiple tumors, of which at least 1 is a cystic tumor. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cystic brain metastasis. Methods. Between January 2001 and November 2005, 680 consecutive patients with brain metastases underwent GKS at our hospital, 30 of whom were included in this study (18 males and 12 females, mean age 60.6 +/- 11 years, range 38-75 years). Inclusion criteria were: 1) no prior whole-brain radiation therapy or resection procedure; 2) a maximum of 4 lesions on preoperative MR imaging; 3) at least 1 cystic lesion; 4) a Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 70; and 5) histological diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Results. Non-small cell lung carcinoma was the primary cancer in most patients (19 patients [63.3%]). A single metastasis was present in 13 patients (43.3%). There was a total of 81 tumors, 33 of which were cystic. Ten patients (33.3%) were in recursive partitioning analysis Class I, and 20 (66.6%) were in Class II. Before drainage the mean tumor volume was 21.8 ml (range 3.8-68 ml); before GKS the mean tumor volume was 10.1 ml (range 1.2-32 ml). The mean prescription dose to the tumor margin was 19.5 Gy (range 12-25 Gy). Overall median patient survival was 15 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 54.7% (95% confidence interval 45.3-64.1%) and 34.2% (95% confidence interval 23.1-45.3%). Local tumor control was achieved in 91.3% of the patients. Conclusions. The results of this study support the use of a multiple stereotactic approach in cases of multiple and cystic brain metastasis.",Excluded

Objective : To investigate the risks and pattern of evolution of peritumoral brain edema (PTE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas. Methods : A retrospective study was conducted on 320 patients (median age 56 years, range 24-87 years) who underwent primary Gamma Knife radiosurgery for asymptomatic meningiomas between 1998 and 2012. The median tumor volume was 2.7 cc (range 0.2-10.5 cc) and the median follow-up was 48 months (range 24-168 months). Volumetric data sets for tumors and PTE on serial MRIs were analyzed. The edema index (EI) was defined as the ratio of the volume of PTE including tumor to the tumor volume, and the relative edema indices (rEIs) were calculated from serial EIs normalized against the baseline EI. Risk factors for PTE were analyzed using logistic regression. Results : Newly developed or increased PTE was noted in 49 patients (15.3%), among whom it was symptomatic in 28 patients (8.8%). Tumor volume larger than 4.2 cc (p<0.001), hemispheric tumor location (p=0.005), and pre-treatment PTE (p<0.001) were associated with an increased risk of PTE. rEI reached its maximum value at 11 months after SRS and decreased thereafter, and symptoms resolved within 24 months in most patients (85.7%). Conclusion : Caution should be exercised in decision-making on SRS for asymptomatic meningiomas of large volume (>4.2 cc), of hemispheric location, or with pre-treatment PTE. PTE usually develops within months, reaches its maximum degree until a year, and resolves within 2 years after SRS. Copyright © 2015 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
3484,"Late-Onset Intractable Cerebrospinal Fluid Leakage After Stereotactic Radiotherapy After Resection of Giant Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenoma. Background: Late-onset skull base cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a very rare complication. Case Description: A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery. Conclusion(s): Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches.

171,"Sex differences in neurochemical effects of dopaminergic drugs in rat striatum. Previous data indicate that dopamine neurotransmission is differently regulated in male and female rats. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the dopamine transporter and autoreceptor as potential loci responsible for this sex difference. Fast cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes was used to monitor changes in electrically evoked levels of extracellular dopamine in the striata of anesthetized male and female rats before and after administration of an uptake inhibitor, a dopamine D2 antagonist, or a D3/D2 agonist. Administration of 40 mg/kg cocaine ip increased electrically-evoked extracellular dopamine concentrations in both sexes, but to a significantly greater extent in female striatum at the higher stimulation frequencies. The typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, increased dopamine efflux in both sexes but the effect was twice as large in the female striatum. The D3/D2 agonist quinpirole induced an unexpected, transient increase in dopamine efflux following high-frequency stimulation only in females, and evoked dopamine was higher in females across this entire time course. More detailed analysis of cocaine effects revealed no fundamental sex differences in the interaction of cocaine with DAT in vivo or in synaptosomes. These results indicate that nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission in the female rat is more tightly regulated by autoreceptor and transporter mechanisms, perhaps related by greater autoreceptor control of DAT activity. Thus, baseline sex differences in striatal dopamine regulation induce different pharmacologic responses. These results contribute to understanding sex differences in stimulant-induced locomotor activity in rats and may have broader implications for neurologic disorders and their pharmacotherapies in humans.",Excluded
304,"Benefits of dual energy CT imaging for differentiating contrast staining versus haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients. Background: Due to the increase in Neurological Thrombectomy cases, we reviewed our 24 hour post procedural unenhanced CT head scan implemented to look for haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct. High attenuation signal can frequently be seen on unenhanced CT scan in these patients within the core infarct and is impossible to differentiate between iodine staining or haemorrhagic transformation. Evaluation of these images has always been subjective with no true diagnosis. Dual Energy CT is an established imaging modality in differentiation of iodine and haemorrhage in high density lesions, post clot retrieval or after contrast administration. Dual energy CT involves acquiring two simultaneous attenuation datasets at a high and low kV. The ratio of the difference in Hounsfield units in these two datasets gives us the ability to accurately differentiate different tissues. Utilising three material decomposition and iodine maps, virtual non-contrast images are created on the Syngo VIA workstation Case studies: A Siemens Dual Source CT scanner was utilised to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and/or haemorrhagic transformation in the case study patients that underwent clot retrieval. This is a robust method of differentiating between haemorrhage and/or iodine staining. Conclusion(s): The ability to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients in a single scan has numerous benefits. The treating team can adapt anticoagulant therapy with confidence, nursing time spent doing regular observations is greatly reduced if no haemorrhage is identified, patients can be expedited to rehabilitation wards, and radiation dose from repeat scans is eliminated.",Excluded
842,"Personalised support of brain tumour patients during radiotherapy based on psychological profile and quality of life. PURPOSE: Psychological distress in primary malignant brain tumour (PMBT) patients is associated with poorer outcomes. Radiotherapy (RT) often induces side effects that significantly influence patients' quality of life (QoL), with potential impact on survival. We evaluated distress, anxiety, depression, and QoL over time to identify patients with difficulties in these areas who required more intense psychological support.METHODS: Psychological questionnaires-Distress Thermometer (DT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G and FACT-Br)-were completed at the beginning (T0), in the middle (T1), directly after RT (T2), and 3 months after RT (T3). We personalised the psychological support provided for each patient with a minimum of three sessions ('typical' schedule) and a maximum of eight sessions ('intensive' schedule), depending on the patients' psychological profiles, clinical evaluations, and requests. Patients' survival was evaluated in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, with an explorative intent.RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive PMBT patients receiving post-operative RT were included. For patients who were reported as 'not distressed' at T0, no statistically significant changes were noted. In contrast, patients who were 'distressed' at T0 showed statistically significant improvements in DT, HADS, FACT-G, and FACT-Br scores over time. 'Not distressed' patients required less psychological sessions over the study duration than 'distressed' patients. Interestingly, 'not distressed' GBM patients survived longer than 'distressed' GBM patients.CONCLUSIONS: Increased psychological support improved distress, mood, and QoL for patients identified as 'distressed', whereas psychological well-being was maintained with typical psychological support in patients who were identified as being 'not distressed'. These results encourage a standardisation of psychological support for all RT patients.",Excluded
1689,"Restricting exposure to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields. A general procedure is described for application of the new ICNIRP exposure guidelines to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields below 100 kHz. The procedure involves weighting of the spectral components with a function that takes into account the basic restrictions and reference levels. A simple first-order RC response or its piecewise linear equivalent is proposed for the weighting function. The weighting can be performed either on the Fourier transformed sample of the measured signal or in real time by processing the signal with an analog or digital filter circuit. The cut-off frequency of the filter is 820 Hz. The occupational exposure criteria are exceeded when the weighted peak magnetic flux density exceeds 43 microT or equivalently the weighted peak dB/dt exceeds 0.22 T s(-1). The maximal peak exposures allowed by the proposed approach are compared with the stimulation thresholds computed with a stimulation model. The results strongly suggest that the safety margin to the stimulation is greater for non-sinusoidal than for sinusoidal waveforms, and at low frequencies it is higher than at high frequencies. The increase of the low-frequency safety margin is desirable to avoid magnetophosphenes and possible CNS effects that may occur below the level predicted by the classical nerve models. Measurement techniques and examples of measured magnetic fields are presented. Particularly high exposures were measured inside MRI equipment and anti-theft gates.",Excluded

Cysts of AE may involve lots of organs like lung, spleen, kidneys, heart, bone and brain and imitate a malign tumor. Method(s): A 31 years old male patient was admitted to our clinic due ataxi and seizures. Neurological examination revealed mildly impaired orientation and mentation, hemiparesis on right extremites and bilateral extensor Babinski sign. We have learned from his medical history he has been diagnosed as metastases of the lung and brain originating from the primary liver malignancy using PET-CT imaging and brain metastases have been treated by radiation theraphy recently. MR examination of brain demonstrated well-defined round hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images and hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images on the parietal, occipital, frontal, temporal and cerebellar regions of the brain. Surrounding oedema and ringshaped contrast enhancement were seen the walls of the cystic lesions. The results of an indirect echinococcal hemagglutination test were positive.

Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from gastrocnemius-soleus. The EMG response occurring in the first 100-120 ms of a fall, considered to be predominantly otolith-spinal in origin, decreased in amplitude immediately upon entering weightlessness, and continued to decline throughout the flight, especially during the first two mission days. The response returned to normal before the first post-flight testing session. The results suggest that information coming from the otolith organs is gradually ignored by the nervous system during prolonged space flight, although the possibility that otolith-spinal reflexes are decreased independent of other otolith output pathways cannot be ruled out.",Excluded

Three men (aged 64, 65, and 67 years) with advanced lung cancer who had been treated with nivolumab developed interstitial lung disease (ILD) during chemotherapy with docetaxel and ramucirumab. The treatment was clinically effective; however, the patients experienced immune-related adverse effects due to nivolumab therapy: two patients developed ILD and the third developed psoriasis. Because the patients showed progression, docetaxel and ramucirumab chemotherapy was administered. Although two patients showed a clinical response, all patients developed grade 3 ILD during therapy. Furthermore, the patients developed respiratory failure and needed corticosteroid therapy. Although their condition improved owing to the therapy, the patients could not receive additional cancer treatment and died of cancer. On the basis of the results obtained, we speculated that although the regimen of docetaxel and ramucirumab after nivolumab therapy might be effective against non-small cell lung cancer, it might increase the risk for ILD in some patients.

606,"Combined endoscopic endonasal surgery and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS) for complex cranial base tumors-early clinical outcomes. Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been shown to be a feasible approach to cranial base tumors while reducing post-operative morbidity. Using the endoscopic endonasal approach alone or in combination with open approaches may provide advantages over conventional approaches. However, the balance between maximal resection and minimal injury to neurovascular structures frequently precludes gross total resection (GTR). Consequently, adjuvant radiation therapy may be an important option to improve local control (LC) of residual disease. In this retrospective series, we report clinical outcomes, morbidity, and LC of 40 patients with cranial base tumors treated with EES +/- combined open approach followed by fSRS (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc.). 26 patients had benign disease, 7 had newly diagnosed malignant disease, and 7 had previously resected malignant disease. Surgical outcomes were evaluable in all patients. LC after fSRS was evaluable in 39 patients and defined as no evidence of regrowth by MRI, CT, & physical examination. GTR was achieved in 12/40. Median post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. In multivariable analysis controlling for anatomic location and malignant histology, post-operative complications (n = 10) were significantly associated with patients having combined open and EES (p < 0.01, OR = 16.9). SRS was delivered in 1-5 sessions to a median marginal dose of 24.9 Gy. Median follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1.5 to 61 months). LC was achieved in 89.7% (35/39) of evaluable patients. LC was achieved in 11/12 patients who had GTR. Median progression-free survival was 19.7 months (21.0 months for benign tumors (n = 26), 5.8 months for previously resected malignant disease (n = 7), and 21.2 months for newly diagnosed malignant disease (n = 7). Of the 31 patients who had symptomatic disease at presentation, 18 (58%) reported complete symptom resolution, 9 partial, and 4 no improvement. One patient who received two prior courses of radiation therapy developed osteosclerosis (grade III). Other adverse events were erythema (grade I, n = 5), nausea (grade II, n = 2), conjunctivitis (grade II, n = 1). EES followed by fSRS is a safe and effective management strategy for selected cranial base tumors. EES combined with an open surgical approach may result in increased complications.

Purpose:Transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta1 signaling is involved in cancer-cell metastasis. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at TGFbeta1 were associated with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Method(s):We genotyped TGFbeta1 SNPs at rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800471 (G915C), and rs1982073 (T+29C) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in blood samples from 205 NSCLC patients who had had definitive radiotherapy at one institution in November 1998-January 2005. We also tested whether the TGF-beta1 rs1982073 (T+29C) SNP affected the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. Result(s):Median follow-up time for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-97 months; 39 months for patients alive at the time of analysis). Multivariate analysis showed that the TGFbeta1 rs1800469 CT/CC genotype was associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.463 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.012-2.114], P = 0.043) and shorter DMFS (HR = 1.601 [95% CI = 1.042-2.459], P = 0.032) and that the TGFbeta1 rs1982073 CT/CC genotype predicted poor DMFS (HR = 1.589 [95% CI = 1.009-2.502], P = 0.046) and poor brain MFS (HR = 2.567 [95% CI = 1.155-5.702], P = 0.021) after adjustment for age, sex, race, performance status, smoking status, tumor histology and volume, stage, receipt of concurrent radiochemotherapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, and radiation dose. Transfection with TGFbeta1+29C (vs. +29T) stimulated the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 cells, suggesting that TGFbeta1+29C may be linked with increased metastatic potential. Conclusion(s):TGFbeta1 genotypes at rs1800469 and rs1982073 could be useful for predicting DMFS among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiation therapy. These findings require validation in larger prospective trials and thorough mechanistic studies. © 2013 Yuan et al.",Excluded
2980,"Growth of beta-amyloid(1-40) protofibrils by monomer elongation and lateral association. Characterization of distinct products by light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Amyloid plaques in brain tissue are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Primary components of these plaques are 40- and 42-residue peptides, denoted A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42), that are derived by proteolysis of cellular amyloid precursor protein. Synthetic A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) form amyloid fibrils in vitro that share many features with the amyloid in plaques. Soluble intermediates in A beta fibrillogenesis, termed protofibrils, have been identified previously, and here we describe the in vitro formation and isolation of A beta(1-40) protofibrils by size exclusion chromatography. In some experiments, the A beta(1-40) was radiomethylated to better quantify various A beta species. Mechanistic studies clarified two separate modes of protofibril growth, elongation by monomer deposition and protofibril-protofibril association, that could be resolved by varying the NaCl concentration. Small isolated protofibrils in dilute Tris-HCl buffers were directed along the elongation pathway by addition of A beta(1-40) monomer or along the association pathway by addition of NaCl. Multi-angle light scattering analysis revealed that protofibrils with initial molecular masses M(w) of (7-30) x 10(3) kDa grew to M(w) values of up to 250 x 10(3) kDa by these two growth processes. However, the mass per unit length of the associated protofibrils was about 2-3 times that of the elongated protofibrils. Rate constants for further elongation by monomer deposition with the elongated, associated, and initial protofibril pools were identical when equal number concentrations of original protofibrils were compared, indicating that the original number of protofibril ends had not been altered by the elongation or association processes. Atomic force microscopy revealed heterogeneous initial protofibrils that became more rodlike following the elongation reaction. Our data indicate that protofibril elongation in the absence of NaCl results from monomer deposition only at the ends of protofibrils and proceeds without an increase in protofibril diameter. In contrast, protofibril association occurs in the absence of monomer when NaCl is introduced, but this association involves lateral interactions that result in a relatively disordered fibril structure.",Excluded
1871,"Transcranial optogenetic stimulation for functional mapping of the motor cortex. We developed a method that uses Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) for transcranial optogenetic stimulation. This method is based on scanning a light beam over the brain, thereby photostimulating ChR2-expressing neurons in intact mice. As a proof of principle, we applied this technique to the motor cortex of transgenic mice expressing ChR2 in cortical pyramidal cells. Photostimulation induced limb movements that were time-locked with millisecond precision and could be induced at frequencies up to 20 Hz. By scanning this light beam, we could map the distribution of neurons associated with limb movement. With this approach we could simultaneously define motor maps controlling two limbs and could reproducibly generate such cortical motor maps over periods of weeks. This method allows non-invasive mapping of brain circuitry in living animals and could help define the connection between behavior and brain circuitry.",Excluded
1496,"Magnetic resonance imaging associates with differences in neurocognitive performance for cancer survivors complaining of cognitive deficits following brain irradiation. BACKGROUND: Following brain irradiation, roughly 50% of cancer survivors develop some higher-order neurocognitive impairment that does not resolve and can decline further into dementia. However, predicting those who will develop cognitive impairment following therapy is not currently possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers from clinical scans may provide candidate biomarkers related to cognitive performance. METHOD(S): Baseline MRI scans and neurocognitive scores were collected from 198 participants enrolled in CCWFU91105 (NCT#00369785) prior to randomization. Subjects self-reported cognitive difficulties and were at least 6 months post-therapy. At minimum, a T1-weighted MRI pre- and post-gadolinium contrast was requested to confirm stable disease in all participants. Additional scans, including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and T2-weighted MRI scans, were available for analysis in subgroups of participants. Significance was assessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) with a family-wise error correction of p < 0.05. RESULT(S): Because of the vast variability in scan protocols, consistent whole-brain imaging (ie, no skip) was found in 50% of post-contrast T1-weighted scans. From these, local gray and white matter volumes were determined. Increased processing speed was associated with increased volume of white matter in the Muratoff bundle (i.e., subcallosal fasciculus), whereas increased verbal fluency was associated with increased white matter in the corpus callosum, left frontal horn, and bilateral cerebellum. Subgroup analysis of other modality scans (as available: FLAIR and diffusion-weighted) supported these findings. Perfusion of gray matter did not correlate with neurocognitive function in the sub-group receiving pulse arterial spin labeling scans. CONCLUSION(S): Variance in brain structure correlated with performance differences on several neurocognitive tests and indicated a strong association between white matter integrity and maintenance of cognitive function in cancer survivors following brain irradiation. Whether a prospective trial from a pretreatment baseline will find white matter integrity to be predictive of postradiotherapy cognitive function remains to be seen.",Excluded
2798,"[Sellar fibrosarcoma following radiotherapy for prolactinoma]. A 51-year-old house woman visited the Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Hospital for examination of the head injury on Oct. 7, 1975. Neurological examination was normal. Endocrinological examination showed galactorrhea. The patient had a past history of premature menopause. Plain skull films revealed enlargement of sella turcica and CT scan showed sellar tumor with suprasellar expansion which was enhanced by contrast medium. The serum prolactin (PRL) level was 3,290 ng/ml. Diagnosis of PRL secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma) was made. Though surgical removal of the tumor was recommended, it was refused by the patient. Therefore, careful observation was continued as an out-patient until May 1979 when she noticed a temporal hemianopsia of her left eye. She was admitted and had partial removal of the tumor via frontal route and subsequent irradiation (total dose of 5,000 rad by Lineac). The tumor was verified to be a prolactinoma by the immunohistochemical staining. Postoperative course was uneventful and she lead a normal life. In Oct. 1981, severe faceache began and she was readmitted. Sella was destructed extensively and CT scan revealed a hugh sellar tumor with multi-directional extrasellar extension which was less enhanced than that of the first study. The serum PRL level was 588 ng/ml and the regrowth of prolactinoma was suspected. High dose bromocriptine (40 mg/day) therapy was started. The serum PRL level rapidly fell to the negligible value, however, shrinkage of the tumor was not observed. On Jan. 20, 1982, suddenly she developed a left hemiparesis and her level of consciousness gradually deteriorated. On Mar. 11, 1982, the second operation was performed and a solid firm tumor in the base of the skull was partially removed. The tumor was histologically verified to be a fibrosarcoma. After the second operation bromocriptine therapy was discontinued, however expected elevation of the serum PRL level was not recognized. She died on Apr. 4, 1982.",Excluded
