1564,"Invited review: gender issues related to spaceflight: a NASA perspective This minireview provides an overview of known and potential gender differences in physiological responses to spaceflight. The paper covers cardiovascular and exercise physiology, barophysiology and decompression sickness, renal stone risk, immunology, neurovestibular and sensorimotor function, nutrition, pharmacotherapeutics, and reproduction. Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about gender-specific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders. Individual characteristics usually outweigh gender differences per se. [References: 65]",Excluded

2015,"Simultaneous measurement of changes in light absorption due to the reduction of cytochrome c oxidase and light scattering in rat brains during loss of tissue viability We performed the simultaneous measurement of intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) related to metabolic activity and cellular and subcellular morphological characteristics, i.e., light scattering for a rat global ischemic brain model made by rapidly removing blood by saline infusion. The signals were measured on the basis of multiwavelength diffuse reflectances in which 605 and 830 nm were used to detect the IOSs that are thought to be dominantly affected by redox changes of heme aa(3) and CuA in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), respectively. For measuring the scattering signal, the wavelength that was found to be most insensitive to the absorption changes, e.g., approximately 620 nm, was used. The measurements suggested that an increase in the absorption due to reduction of heme aa(3) occurred soon after blood clearance, and this was followed by a large triphasic change in light scattering, during which time a decrease in the absorption due to reduction of CuA occurred. Through the triphasic scattering change, scattering signals increased by 5.2 +/- 1.5% (n = 5), and the increase in light scattering showed significant correlation with both the reflectance intensity changes at 605 and 830 nm. This suggests that morphological changes in cells correlate with reductions of heme aa(3) and CuA. Histological analysis of tissue after the triphasic scattering change showed no alteration in either the nuclei or the cytoskeleton, but electron microscopic observation revealed deformed, enlarged mitochondria and expanded dendrites. These findings suggest that the simultaneous measurement of absorption signals related to the redox changes in the CcO and the scattering signal is useful for monitoring tissue viability in the brain.",Excluded
2360,"Effect of Nox2 inhibition unloading-induced changes in morphology and nNOSmu translocation in the rat soleus Removal of mechanical loading (spaceflight, bedrest, casting) causes rapid atrophy of affected skeletal muscles. Recently, we identified that translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSmu) and downstream activation of FoxO3a were redox-sensitive phenomena. Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU-induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber-type shift from slow to fast twitch. Loss of sarcolemmal nNOSmu activity with HU, visualized using NADPH diaphorase and confirmed with immunofluorescence were also mitigated by gp91dsTAT. Gp91dsTAT also attenuated membrane localization of the Nox2 subunit p67phox. We conclude that Nox2 inhibition protects against muscle fiber atrophy and translocation of nNOSmu.",Excluded
2256,"First-in-human phase 0 trial of oral 5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose (IPDR) in patients with advanced malignancies Background: Iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd or IUDR), a halogenated nucleoside analog, has produced responses in patients with high-grade anaplastic astrocytomas and sarcomas when administered as a radiosensitizer via continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion over the course of radiation therapy. Since continuous i.v. infusion is impractical for several weeks of radiotherapy, we conducted a phase 0 trial of IPdR, an oral prodrug of IdUrd, in patients (pts) with advanced malignances. Prior to embarking on large-scale clinical trials, our objective was to determine whether the oral route was a feasible alternative to continuous i.v. infusion. Plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and other metabolites were measured after a single oral dose of IPdR. Trial design: Eligible pts had advanced refractory malignancies; age >=18 years; ECOG PS <= 2; adequate organ function; were at least 2 weeks from prior anticancer therapy. All pts verbalized their understanding of the non-therapeutic nature of the trial prior to signing the consent form. A single oral dose of IPdR was administered per pt; dose escalations were planned (150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg, 2400 mg) with one pt per dose level and 6 pts at the highest dose level. Blood sampling was performed over a 24-hour period for pharmacokinetic analysis. All pts were followed for 14 days for safety assessments. Significant toxicities were defined as grade >=2 non-hematologic toxicities; grade >=2 thrombocytopenia; grade >=3 anemia, leucopenia, or neutropenia. If one pt developed significant toxicity, no additional patients were to be enrolled. Result(s): There were no drug-related adverse events. Ten pts were enrolled; median age 60 yrs (range 45-66 yrs); M/F 8/2; diagnosis (# of pts): thyroid (2), lymphoma (1), neuroendocrine (1), hepatocellular (1), adenoid cystic (1), bladder (1), colorectal (2), breast cancer (1). A dosedependent increase in the plasma concentration was observed for IdUrd from 150 mg to 2400 mg. At the 2400 mg dose, all 6 pts achieved peak IdUrd levels of (mean+/-SD) 4.0+/-1.02mM (25% CV) at 1.67+/-1.21 h. Peak levels of iodouracil, the major metabolite, were 133+/-42mM at 3.3+/-1.0 h post IPdR administration. Conclusion(s): Single-dose oral IPdR was well tolerated, and adequate plasma levels were obtained to justify proceeding with a phase I trial of IPdR in combination with radiation. This clinical investigation clearly demonstrates the ability of a small phase 0 study to determine the critical information that can shape the path for decision-making regarding future development of a drug.",Excluded
1687,"Pharmacokinetics of the potent hallucinogen, salvinorin A in primates parallels the rapid onset and short duration of effects in humans Salvia divinorum, a mint plant originally used by the Mazatecs of Oaxaca, Mexico in spiritual rituals has gained popularity, in smoked form, as a legal hallucinogen in the United States and Europe. Abuse results in rapid onset and short-lasting effects that include visual hallucinations and motor-function impairment. Salvinorin A, the psychoactive component of S. divinorum, is a uniquely potent agonist at kappa-opioid receptors, targets for new therapeutic drugs. We labeled salvinorin A with C-11 by acylation of salvinorin B with [11C]-acetyl chloride to study whether its kinetic behavior in the brain parallels its uniquely fast, yet brief physiological effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies performed in 6 adult female baboons indicated extremely rapid brain uptake reaching a peak accounting for 3.3% of the total administered dose in 40 s and clearing with a half-life of 8 min. [11C]-salvinorin A was distributed throughout the brain with the highest concentration in the cerebellum and a notable concentration in the visual cortex, perhaps accounting for its physiological effects when smoked. Naloxone administration did not reduce the overall concentration of [11C]-salvinorin A significantly nor did it change its regional distribution. Peripheral organ kinetics suggested at least two modes of metabolism and excretion occur: through the renal and biliary systems. Our findings have revealed that the exceptionally rapid uptake and brief duration of salvinorin A in the brain match the time-course of visual hallucinations for S. divinorum when smoked. The effects of salvinorin A may occur at <10 mug in the human brain, emphasizing its remarkable potency.",Excluded
1373,"Clinical significance of downstaging in patients with limited-disease small-cell lung cancer BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of downstaging on OS in LD-SCLC patients treated with first-line treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 210 LD-SCLC patients who were treated with first-line treatment at Seoul National University Hospital between April 1999 and November 2012. Compared with initial tumor, node, metastases (TNM) stage, cases that showed a lower TNM stage after treatment were defined as 'downstaging.' The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and a subgroup analysis on the responders was performed.RESULTS: After first-line treatment, 78 (37.1%) patients achieved complete response, 97 (46.2%) achieved PR, and 35 (16.7%) experienced stable disease or progressive disease. A hundred and fifty one patients (71.9%) showed downstaging of their diseases, and the remaining 59 patients (28.1%) showed no change or upstaging. The median OS for patients achieving downstaging and no change/upstaging were 32.8 months and 13.1 months, respectively (P < .001). Of the 97 patients who achieved PR, the OS was significantly longer in patients who showed downstaging than those who did not (25.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively; P = .004). In multivariate analyses, female sex, downstaging, lower initial TNM stage, and prophylactic cranial irradiation were independent good prognostic factors for OS.CONCLUSION: Downstaging might be an independent good prognostic factor in LD-SCLC. Specifically, downstaging is expected to be useful for stratification of patients achieving PR. Further prospective studies are warranted to verify whether patients who achieved PR without downstaging can be candidates for consolidation treatments after first-line treatment.",Excluded
1439,"Low-grade gliomas in adults Low-grade gliomas are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms usually encountered in younger patient populations. These tumors represent a unique challenge because most patients will survive a decade or more and may be at a higher risk for treatment-related complications. Clinical observations over the years have identified a subset of low-grade gliomas that tends to manifest more aggressive clinical behavior and require earlier, more aggressive intervention. Clinical and molecular parameters may allow better assessment of prognosis and application of risk-adjusted management strategies that may include resection, radiation, or chemotherapy. Improved methods of long-term cognitive and functional assessment are desperately needed in this patient population. ©AlphaMed Press.",Excluded
1541,"Skin fibroblast cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma (NHL) patients show increased sensitivity to chronic gamma irradiation Cultured fibroblast cells from 19 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 3 patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), 3 AT heterozygotes and 11 (presumed) normal subjects were studied for impaired colony-forming ability after chronic gamma irradiation. Five cell lines from the NHL patients were also examined for the sensitivity to acute gamma irradiation, as compared with those of normal subjects. To ascertain the degree of radiosensitivity of different cell lines, a comparison was made of the D10 values (radiation dose resulting in 10% survival) for each cell line, estimated ""by eye"" from the actual survival curves, and also from the calculated curves fitted to a log-linear model. It was observed that the acute gamma irradiation failed to show any appreciable difference in the radiation response of the cell lines from NHL patients as compared with those of normal subjects. However, chronic irradiation demonstrated significantly increased radiosensitivity in at least 10-12 NHL patients with a p value of less than 0.05, when the D10 values of each patient's cell line were compared with the calculated composite values for the normals. When the D10 values of the NHL patients and the normal subjects were compared as 2 groups, the former appeared to be significantly more sensitive to chronic gamma irradiation (p less than 0.0001). The same level of significant difference in radiosensitivity was found between the 2 groups when their D37 values (radiation dose resulting in 37% survival) were compared. In general, the radiation response of the NHL patients was similar to that of the AT homozygotes and heterozygotes used as a positive control group. Our data thus show that increased radiosensitivity is associated with the NHL patients studied, indicating an underlying abnormality of their DNA repair.",Excluded

1695,"Temporal information loss in the macaque early visual system Stimuli that modulate neuronal activity are not always detectable, indicating a loss of information between the modulated neurons and perception. To identify where in the macaque visual system information about periodic light modulations is lost, signal-to-noise ratios were compared across simulated cone photoreceptors, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons, and perceptual judgements. Stimuli were drifting, threshold-contrast Gabor patterns on a photopic background. The sensitivity of LGN neurons, extrapolated to populations, was similar to the monkeys' at low temporal frequencies. At high temporal frequencies, LGN sensitivity exceeded the monkeys' and approached the upper bound set by cone photocurrents. These results confirm a loss of high-frequency information downstream of the LGN. However, this loss accounted for only about 5% of the total. Phototransduction accounted for essentially all of the rest. Together, these results show that low temporal frequency information is lost primarily between the cones and the LGN, whereas high-frequency information is lost primarily within the cones, with a small additional loss downstream of the LGN.",Excluded
2069,"Biological effect of an alternating electric field on cell proliferation and synergistic antimitotic effect in combination with ionizing radiation Alternating electric fields at an intermediate frequency (100~300 kHz), referred to as tumour-treating fields (TTF), are believed to interrupt the process of mitosis via apoptosis and to act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Although the existence of an antimitotic effect of TTF is widely known, the proposed apoptotic mechanism of TTF on cell function and the efficacy of TTF are controversial issues among medical experts. To resolve these controversial issues, a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of TTF on cell function and the differences between the effects of TTF alone and in combination with other treatment techniques is essential. Here, we report experimental evidence of TTF-induced apoptosis and the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). For these experiments, two human Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87) were treated either with TTF alone or with TTF followed by ionizing radiation (IR). Cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were quantified after the application of TTF, and their percentages were markedly increased when TTF was combined with IR. Our experimental results also suggested that TTF combined with IR synergistically suppressed both cell migration and invasion, based on the inhibition of MMP-9 and vimentin.",Excluded
1353,"Oncolytic herpes simplex virus and radiation combination therapy results in a systemic immune response to inhibit neuroblastoma tumor growth INTRODUCTION: Viral and gene therapy are promising approaches to treating neuroblastoma. An oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) expressing the cytokine Interleukin-12 (M002) was previously shown to inhibit neuroblastoma xenograft growth. We hypothesized that human neuroblastoma tumors express the viral entry receptor, CD111. Additionally, we hypothesized that M002 would produce a secondary immune response to inhibit murine neuroblastoma growth distant from the treatment site in an immunocompetent model. METHOD(S): Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human neuroblastoma tumor specimens (IRB-X111123007) were stained for CD111. NXS2 murine neuroblastoma cells (7.5x10^5 cells) were injected into bilateral flanks of immunocompetent mice (IACUC- 120409363). Established right-sided tumors were treated with M002 (1x107 pfu) and radiation (3Gy).Half of these mice received a repeat right-sided dose of M002 and radiation. Tumor volumes on both flanks were measured every 2 days. Data were compared with appropriate statistical analysis with significance p<=0.05. RESULT(S): All 12 human neuroblastoma specimens expressed CD111. In the murine bilateral flank tumor model, repeat treatment of the right flank with M002 and radiation led to significant inhibition of tumor growth in the untreated flank tumor compared to animals who received a single dose to the right flank (323.44 +/- 215.51 mm3 vs. 955.08 +/- 366.54 mm3, p<=0.05). CONCLUSION(S): CD111 expression was present in human neuroblastoma specimens, indicating that oHSV would infect these tumors. M002 inhibited progression of murine tumors both locally and distant from the site of therapy, demonstrating a systemic effect. These data support the potential use of oHSV therapy to treat recurrent or metastatic neuroblastoma.",Excluded
1481,"Disease-related microstructural differences in the brain in females with localized provoked vulvodynia Localized provoked vulvodynia (LPVD) affects almost 15% of females and is characterized by localized sensitivity of the vulvar vestibule. Very little research has been performed to characterize central abnormalities in LPVD using neuroimaging. The few studies that are available indicate that neural alterations may play a causal role in symptom generation or are secondary responses to the chronic pain condition. The aim of the study was to utilize diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to identify unique microstructural differences in the brain. We compare LPVD to HCs to assess whether alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), which are measures of cohesive axonal orientation and tissue compactness, are specific to pain, and with IBS to determine distinct or shared mechanisms with another chronic pelvic-pain disorder. Structural and DTI MRIs were conducted in a sample of 58 age-matched premenopausal females. FA and MD were processed using the FMBRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Voxelwise and ICBM atlas based region of interest analyses were performed using pairwise t-tests with age as a covariate. LPVD vs. HC: Patients with LPVD demonstrated significantly higher FA in brainstem regions including the left superior cerebellar peduncle as well as the medial lemniscus. There were also higher FA values in frontal lobe connections, right internal capsule, right corona radii, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, and primary sensory and motor regions. Higher MD was observed within the cingulum bundle and left anterior limb of internal capsule. LPVD vs. IBS: FA and MD differences between LPVD and IBS patients were less extensive and only localized to regions near the right posterior corona radiata and left posterior thalamic radiation. The significant group-related microstructural differences in deep gray matter structures included regions that are associated with sensorimotor tasks and cognitive-emotional tasks, suggesting increased processing and modulation of sensory and endogenous pain modulatory systems in LPVD.",Excluded
1384,"RF heating of deep brain stimulation implants in open-bore vertical MRI systems: A simulation study with realistic device configurations Purpose: Patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants benefit highly from MRI, however, access to MRI is restricted for these patients because of safety hazards associated with RF heating of the implant. To date, all MRI studies on RF heating of medical implants have been performed in horizontal closed-bore systems. Vertical MRI scanners have a fundamentally different distribution of electric and magnetic fields and are now available at 1.2T, capable of high-resolution structural and functional MRI. This work presents the first simulation study of RF heating of DBS implants in high-field vertical scanners. Method(s): We performed finite element electromagnetic simulations to calculate specific absorption rate (SAR) at tips of DBS leads during MRI in a commercially available 1.2T vertical coil compared to a 1.5T horizontal scanner. Both isolated leads and fully implanted systems were included. Result(s): We found 10- to 30-fold reduction in SAR implication at tips of isolated DBS leads, and up to 19-fold SAR reduction at tips of leads in fully implanted systems in vertical coils compared to horizontal birdcage coils. Conclusion(s): If confirmed in larger patient cohorts and verified experimentally, this result can open the door to plethora of structural and functional MRI applications to guide, interpret, and advance DBS therapy.

2037,"Impacts of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight on Cerebral Autoregulation It is well known that exposure to microgravity in astronauts leads to a plethora physiological responses such as headward fluid shift, body unloading, and cardiovascular deconditioning. When astronauts return to Earth, some encounter problems related to orthostatic intolerance. An impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA), which could be compromised by the effects of microgravity, has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for orthostatic intolerance. CA is a homeostatic mechanism that maintains cerebral blood flow for any variations in cerebral perfusion pressure by adapting the vascular tone and cerebral vessel diameter. The ground-based models of microgravity are useful tools for determining the gravitational impact of spaceflight on human body. The head-down tilt bed rest (HDTBR), where the subject remains in supine position at -6 degrees for periods ranging from few days to several weeks is the most commonly used ground-based model of microgravity for cardiovascular deconditioning. head-down bed rest (HDBR) is able to replicate cephalic fluid shift, immobilization, confinement, and inactivity. Dry immersion (DI) model is another approach where the subject remains immersed in thermoneutral water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric separating the subject from the water. Regarding DI, this analog imitates absence of any supporting structure for the body, centralization of body fluids, immobilization and hypokinesia observed during spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of microgravity on CA. Here, we review the fundamental principles and the different mechanisms involved in CA. We also consider the different approaches in order to assess CA. Finally, we focus on the effects of short- and long-term spaceflight on CA and compare these findings with two specific analogs to microgravity: HDBR and DI.",Excluded
2031,"Comparison of tumour age response to radiation for cells derived from tissue culture or solid tumours Direct comparison of the cell age of 9L and KHT tumour cells derived either from tissue culture or solid tumours was achieved. Cells from dissociated KHT and 9L tumours (the latter implanted either subcutaneously or intracerebrally) and cells from tissue culture were separated into homogenous sized populations by centrifugal elutriation. In both tumour models these homogeneous sized populations correspond to populations enriched at different stages of the cell cycle. The survival of these elutriated cell populations was measured after a single dose of Cs-137 gamma rays. For cells isolated from 9L solid tumours, there was little variation in radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle; however, a very small but significant increase in resistance was found in late G<inf>1</inf> cells. This lack of a large variation in radiosensitivity through the cell cycle for 9L cells from solid tumours also was seen in 9L cells growing in monolayer tissue culture. When similar experiments were performed using the KHT sarcoma tumour model, the results showed that KHT cells in vitro exhibited a fairly conventional increase in radioresistance in both mid G<inf>1</inf> and late S. However, the cell age response of KHT cells from solid tumours was different; particularly in the late S and G<inf>2</inf> + M phases. These data demonstrate that direct extrapolation of in vitro cell age responses to the in situ situation may not always be valid.",Excluded
1649,"Gel-based proteomics of unilateral irradiated striatum after gamma knife surgery Gamma knife surgery (GKS) is used for the treatment of various brain disorders. The biological effects of focal gamma ray irradiation on targeted or surrounding areas in the brain are not well-known. In the present study, we evaluated protein expression changes in the unilateral irradiated (60 Gy) striatum in rat. Striata of irradiated and control brains were dissected 16 h post-irradiation for analysis by large-format two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). In parallel, we also examined the un-targeted contralateral striatum over the control for potential changes in proteins patterns that may have occurred due to the effects of irradiation to the unilateral striatum. A total of 17 reproducible and differentially expressed silver nitrate-stained protein spots in the irradiated striatum was detected on 2-D gel. Their subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 13 nonredundant proteins. Interestingly, out of these 13 changed proteins, 2 proteins were also detected in the contralateral striatum. Some of the significantly changed proteins identified were creatine kinase, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDA3), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2). Western analysis with anti-PDA3 and anti-Prx2 antibodies revealed 4 and 2 cross-reacting protein spots on 2-D gel blots. Interestingly, after GKS, in the irradiated and un-irradiated striata, these spots showed a shift toward the acidic side, suggesting post-translational modifications. Taken together, these results indicate that unilateral irradiation during GKS triggers molecular changes in the bilateral striata.",Included
1906,"Impact of brain tumors and radiotherapy on the presence of gadolinium in the brain after repeated administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents: an experimental study in rats PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations induced by an experimental tumor and radiotherapy on MRI signal intensity (SI) in deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and the presence of gadolinium after repeated administration of a linear gadolinium-based contrast agent in rats.METHODS: Eighteen Fischer rats were divided into a tumor (gliosarcoma, GS9L model), a radiotherapy, and a control group. All animals received 5 daily injections (1.8 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. For tumor-bearing animals, the BBB disruption was confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. Animals from the tumor and radiation group underwent radiotherapy in 6 fractions of 5 Gray. The SI ratio between DCN and brain stem was evaluated on T1-weigthed MRI at baseline and 1 week after the last administration. Subsequently, the brain was dissected for gadolinium quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was done with the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: An increased but similar DCN/brain stem SI ratio was found for all three groups (p = 0.14). The gadolinium tissue concentrations (median, nmol/g) were 6.7 (tumor), 6.3 (radiotherapy), and 6.8 (control) in the cerebellum (p = 0.64) and 17.8/14.6 (tumor), 20.0/18.9 (radiotherapy), and 17.8/15.9 (control) for the primary tumor (p = 0.98) and the contralateral hemisphere (p = 0.41) of the cerebrum, respectively.CONCLUSION: An experimental brain tumor treated by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone did not alter DCN signal hyperintensity and gadolinium concentration in the rat brain 1 week after repeated administration of gadopentetate. This suggests that a local BBB disruption does not affect the amount of retained gadolinium in the brain.",Included
1523,"Effects of mobile phone emissions on human brain activity and sleep variables Purpose: To compare the findings of the main studies that have examined the effects of GSM mobile phone radiofrequency emissions on human brain activity and sleep variables. Material(s) and Method(s): Fourteen published studies reporting on human brain electrical activity measurements during and/or after such radiofrequency emissions were identified and compared. Conclusion(s): Although, in general, outcomes have been inconsistent and comparison between individual studies is difficult, enhanced electroencephalogram alpha-band power has been noted in several of the studies, a phenomenon also observed in some animal studies. Performance decrements observed in some recent extremely low frequency studies are consistent with enhanced alpha-band power, highlighting the possible role of extremely low frequency fields associated with battery current in mobile phone handsets. However, more complex cognitive tasks appear to show improved performance in relation to mobile phone exposure. Significant cognitive effects have been reported using both modulated and unmodulated radiofrequency carriers. The possibility of putative effects being due to extremely low frequency demodulation is therefore unlikely. There are no obvious associations between the site of exposure and regions of the brain from which effects are reported or implied. Lastly, radiofrequency effects have been reported to occur both during exposure and up to 1 h or so after cessation of exposure.",Excluded
1881,"Guided imagery, anxiety, heart rate, and heart rate variability during centrifuge training BACKGROUND: Centrifuge training is an important method of improving the hypergravity tolerance of pilots, cosmonauts, and Chinese astronauts. However, the concomitants of tension or anxiety often impede training. Guided imagery (GI), a mind-body relaxation technique, provides a behavioral and cognitive means whereby individuals are able to exert control over the focus of attention. This study aims to investigate the immediate effects of GI for reducing stress in centrifuge training.METHODS: There were 12 healthy young men who were randomly assigned to a GI group or music group. We measured changes in heart rate during centrifuge training, in heart rate variability before and after centrifuge training, and also evaluated relaxation and anxiety in three phases: before intervention, after intervention, and following centrifuge training.RESULTS: The change in the pattern of anxiety was different in the two groups over the three phases. Anxiety (measured by State Anxiety Inventory) in the GI group changed from 31.7 +/- 5.9 to 26.8 +/- 2.6 and 27.8 +/- 4.1, whereas for the music group this changed from 32.2 +/- 7.6 to 31.2 +/- 8.3 and 26.8 +/- 6.8. During centrifuge training, the maximal HR for the GI group (101.2 +/- 8.8) was lower than that of the music group (123.0 +/- 19.1). In addition GI showed a decrease in low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) components and an increase in high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) components before and after centrifuge training.CONCLUSION: GI was capable of decreasing tension, anxiety, and sympathetic nervous system activity pre- or post-centrifugation.",Excluded
1960,"Evaluation of porphyrin C analogues for photodynamic therapy of cerebral glioma A series of monomeric porphyrins (2-8) based on porphyrin C (1) have been tested as sensitisers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cerebral glioma using the in vitro/in vivo C6 intracerebral animal tumour model. The in vivo screening, consisting of cytotoxicity, phototoxicity (red light) and subcellular localisation studies, revealed two sensitisers (porphyrin 7, molecular weight 863 Da and porphyrin 8, molecular weight 889 Da), which had greater photoactivity than porphyrin C and similar photoactivity to haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) although at a 5-fold higher dose than HpD. Both sensitisers showed intracellular localisation to discrete organelle sites and exhibited considerably less 'dark' cytotoxicity than HpD. The kinetics of uptake of porphyrins 7 and 8 was studied in the mouse C6 glioma model as well as in biopsy samples from normal brain, liver, spleen and blood. Maximal drug uptake levels in tumour occurred 9 and 6 h after intraperitoneal injection for 7 and 8 respectively, at which time the tumour to normal brain ratios were 15:1 and 13:1 respectively. The effect of PDT using porphyrin 7 activated by the gold metal vapour laser tuned to 627.8 nm was studied in Wistar rats bearing intracerebral C6 glioma. At a drug dose of 10 mg porphyrin 7 kg-1 body weight and laser doses of up to 400 J cm-2 light, selective tumour kill with sparing of normal brain was achieved, with a maximal depth of tumour kill of 1.77+/-0.40. mm.

2112,"The effects of sequential versus concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy on survival and toxicity in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytoma PURPOSE: To determine the effects of sequential versus concurrent administration of cranial radiotherapy and cisplatin/carmustine (BCNU) chemotherapy on survival and toxicity in newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytomas.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1988 to 1996, 101 patients were treated on 2 therapeutic protocols for malignant glioma that used the identical chemotherapy regimen but differed in the timing of cranial radiotherapy. The eligibility criteria for the 2 protocols were identical. In the first protocol (1988-1991, 52 patients), cisplatin 120 mg/BCNU 120 mg i.v. over 72 h, was given for 3 monthly cycles prior to cranial radiotherapy. After a response rate of 42%, with a median survival of 13 months was achieved with this sequential regimen, a successor protocol (1992-1996, 49 patients) was developed in which cranial radiotherapy began concurrently with the start of the identical chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy was delayed but not discontinued if prolonged grade III/IV hematologic toxicity was experienced, but protocol therapy was discontinued if disease progression or thromboembolic events occurred. Survival outcome and hematologic toxicity were compared for the patients treated on these protocols.RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of sequentially-treated patients and 68% of concurrently-treated patients completed all planned therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival was similar to concurrent or sequential administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (median 12.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was significantly less in sequentially- versus concurrently-treated patients, with median nadir per cycle (2.9 vs. 1.8 x 10(3)/mm3) (p < 0.001), and incidence of grade 3/4 leukopenia 40% versus 77% (p = 0.002). There was also an increase in platelet transfusion requirements in concurrently-treated patients, but no significant worsening of anemia. We postulate that the worsened leukopenia results from the effects of concurrent radiotherapy on circulating stem cells.CONCLUSION: Concurrent radiotherapy with this regimen of cisplatin and BCNU chemotherapy did not improve survival, but did increase hematologic toxicity. Therefore, we do not recommend further testing of the concurrent regimen, whereas the sequential regimen is currently under evaluation in a Phase III trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Southwest Oncology Group. In addition, these studies demonstrate that relatively small radiotherapy fields can deliver a dose to circulating stem cells sufficient to worsen the hematologic toxicity of concurrent myelosuppressive chemotherapy, a phenomena which should be considered in the design of combined modality protocols for other body sites.",Excluded
1824,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. [German] Hyperbaric oxygenation is defined as the administration of 100% oxygen in a compression chamber at an ambient pressure greater than one atmosphere absolute. The increased pressure (up to three atmospheres) induces a 10- to 15-fold plasma oxygen concentration resulting in increased tissue oxygenation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the bactericidal capacity of leukocytes, stimulates important mechanisms in wound healing, reduces tissue oedema and maintains tissue oxygenation even in the absence of haemoglobin. Commonly accepted indications supported by scientific evidence include the decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, severe carbon monoxide poisoning, delayed radiation injury, clostridial myonecrosis and also the improvement of healing of vulnerable skin or soft tissue grafts. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also used in healing difficulties of specific problem wounds, extreme blood loss, intracranial abscesses, necrotizing soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, crush syndrome, burns and sudden deafness. Since hyperbaric oxygenation involves the administration of oxygen in a pharmacological dose, side effects are possible due to barotrauma and oxygen toxicity. During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, an increased amount of oxygen-free radicals may be generated, depending on the duration and extent of pressure elevation during treatment. Although many different organ systems may be affected, the brain is of greatest clinical significance. Neurotoxicity is manifested by visual disturbances, auditory hallucinations, nausea, facial twitching, irritability, dizziness and convulsion.",Excluded
1887,"Simulation of reflected light intensity changes during navigation and radio-frequency lesioning in the brain An electrode with adjacent optical fibers for measurements during navigation and radio frequency lesioning in the brain is modeled for Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in brain tissue. Relative reflected light intensity at 780 nm, I780, from this electrode and probes with identical fiber configuration are simulated using the intensity from native white matter as reference. Models are made of homogeneous native and coagulated gray, thalamus, and white matter as well as blood. Dual layer models, including models with a layer of cerebrospinal fluid between the fibers and the brain tissue, are also made. Simulated I780 was 0.16 for gray matter, 0.67 for coagulate gray matter, 0.36 for thalamus, 0.39 for coagulated thalamus, unity for white matter, 0.70 for coagulated white matter, and 0.24 for blood. Thalamic matter is also found to reflect more light than gray matter and less than white matter in clinical studies. In conclusion, the reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between gray and white matter during navigation. Furthermore, coagulation of light gray tissue, such as the thalamus, might be difficult to detect using I780, but coagulation in darker gray tissue should result in a rapid increase of I780.",Excluded
2187,"The interaction of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and ionizing radiation in a rat glioma model The effects of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and cobalt 60 (60Co) irradiation were studied in a rat glioma model using an in vivo and an in vitro clonogenic assay. There was no effect on tumor growth by visible light or by a single dose of 60Co irradiation at 4 Gy or 8 Gy, whereas 16 Gy inhibited tumor growth to 40% versus the control. Hematoporphyrin derivative alone slightly stimulated growth (P less than 0.1). Light in the presence of 10 mg hematoporphyrin derivative/kg inhibited tumor growth to 32%. 60Co irradiation in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a significant tumor growth inhibition (P less than 0.02). This growth inhibition was directly related to the concentration of hematoporphyrin derivative. The addition of 60Co to light in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a greater growth inhibition than light or 60Co irradiation alone. This effect was most pronounced when light was applied 30 minutes before 60Co irradiation. Our experiments in a subcutaneous rat glioma model suggest a radiosensitizing effect of hematoporphyrin derivative. Furthermore, the photodynamic inactivation is enhanced by the addition of 60Co irradiation. These findings may be of importance in planning new treatment modalities in malignant brain tumors.",Excluded
2270,"Growth inhibition and radiosensitization of cultured glioma cells by nitric oxide generating agents The authors examined the effect of nitric oxide (NO) generating agents on the growth and radiosensitivity of cultured glioma cells. Three glioma, rat C6, and human T98G and U87 cell lines were treated with the NO generating agents, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP). These agents released NO in the cell culture media and inhibited the growth of the glioma cells. Growth-inhibition was attenuated by hemoglobin, a known inhibitor of NO, suggesting it is mediated by NO. When C6 and T98G cells were irradiated in the presence of SNAP or SNP at 100 microM, radiosensitization was observed. SNAP at 100 microM exhibited a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.4 for C6 cells and 1.8 for T98G cells. SNP at 100 microM only radiosensitized T98G cells with a SER of 1.9. The effect of SNP on radiosensitization of C6 cells was unclear. We conclude that NO generating agents are potential growth inhibitors and radiosensitizers for malignant glioma cells. NO mediated radiosensitization of glioma cells by NO generating agents may offer a new therapeutic approach for malignant glioma.",Excluded
2364,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded

2108,"Biomedical applications of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy EPR spectroscopy is the most straightforward-to-use technique for studying free radicals and other paramagnetic species and has therefore established itself in biomedical research and for clinical applications. EPR found its applications in oximetry, where this technique allows repeated measurements of oxygen in tissues-also in vivo and in combination with imaging techniques. The direct detection of paramagnetic species like transition metal ions by EPR allows elucidation of their specific roles in disease, for example how copper ions might be involved in the formation of amyloid- or amyloid-like fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases. For investigations on the structures of this protein aggregates, but also of other proteins or protein complexes with medical relevance the technique of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL)-the site-specific introduction of paramagnetic reporter groups into proteins or nucleic acids-is nowadays frequently used, especially in cases where other structural techniques are not applicable. Moreover, by direct detection of free radicals-also in combination with spin trapping methods, or application of SDSL, EPR spectroscopy can be also used for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in cancer diagnostics. This review gives an up-to-date overview about how EPR spectroscopy is currently used in biomedical research and clinical applications, with special emphasis on biomedical applications of SDSL EPR.

1611,"Prenatal pathogenesis of hydro-micrencephaly induced by X-rays. An animal model Experimental results are presented which describe induction and pathogenesis of the hydro-micrencephaly in NMRI-mice after single X-irradiation with 0.9 Gy or 1.9 Gy on gestation day (gd) 12. The ultrastructural alterations in the ventricular walls are sequentially investigated up to gross developmental damage. The ventricular zone is the most sensitive region in the developing brain. Its constituting undifferentiated and proliferating cells lose their palisade like orientation and fail subsequently to differentiate into primitive neurons, glia cells, or ependymal cells. Structurally this results in the thinning of ventricular walls by more than 50% associated with periventricular oedema and a dilation of the brain ventricles by 20-60%. Damage is clearly more pronounced with the higher dose. Repair processes originate from regions with intact Zonulae adherents which give also rise to typical globular or cylindrical heterotopic structures; these are known as rosettes and made up from undifferentiated proliferating ventricular cells. Perinatally in these rosettes cell replication persists, at a time when cell production in the ventricular zone has ceased. Histological changes are most prominent in and around the telencephalic roof consisting in replacement of the ependymal lining by a felt of glial fibers, faulty myelinisation, and periventricular oedema; postnatally these structural alterations lead to hydro-micrencephaly. Results from this animal model can be translated to the human situation because the fundamental developmental processes in the brain of mammals are similar despite species related differences of the time scale.",Excluded
1284,"Monitoring radiation treatment effects in glioblastoma: Are changes in flair volume prognostic? Purpose/Objective(s): Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity is believed to represent microscopic infiltration of tumor in glioblastoma (GBM), but is also affected by post-treatment changes. Numerous studies have evaluated the relationship between FLAIR volume and clinical outcomes, but results have been mixed. We sought to develop an objective measure of FLAIR volume that was independent of user input and not influenced by digital contrast adjustment. Using this automated method of image analysis, we evaluated the relationship between pre-radiation FLAIR volume and post-radiation changes in FLAIR volume in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed FLAIR imaging data from 56 consecutive GBM patients treated at a single institution between January 2012 and December 2013. An increase in FLAIR signal was defined as voxels 2 standard deviations above the median intensity value across the entire brain-extracted volume. This automated process was performed on the post-resection, pre-radiation MRI scan as well as all available post-radiation FLAIR sequences. The volume of voxels reaching this threshold was computed for all sequences. All patient charts were reviewed to compute the PFS, which was defined as any radiographic or clinical progression leading to a recommendation to change or stop treatment. Result(s): Of 56 patients, 24 (43%) were female and the median age was 60.5 years (range 16 e 85). Our analysis failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between the initial FLAIR volume and overall survival or clinically defined PFS. The change in FLAIR volume after radiation therapy as a function of time was also not related to these clinical outcome measures. The lack of a significant association between these measures was also true when using a more stringent threshold of FLAIR hyperintensity (5 standard deviations above the mean). Conclusion(s): With the assumption that FLAIR signal represents inflammatory edema caused by tumor infiltration into otherwise healthy tissue, many studies have attempted to correlate FLAIR volume with OS and PFS in the post-treatment setting. Results of these studies have varied, and the prognostic value of FLAIR volume has yet to be clearly demonstrated in glioblastoma. Using an automated and objective volumetric measure, we found no significant correlation between clinical outcomes and changes in FLAIR volume, a measure that is often used in routine MRI surveillance in the post-treatment setting. Our results suggest that gross edema volumes cannot directly predict PFS or OS.",Excluded
2306,"Analysis of the ATM protein in wild-type and ataxia telangiectasia cells Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a human disorder that results in a number of clinical symptoms, including cerebellar degeneration and increased cancer predisposition. Recently the gene that is defective in A-T has been cloned and designated ATM. Here, we describe the production of antisera raised against the approximately 350 kDa ATM protein. Antisera specificity is confirmed by them recognising a approximately 350 kDa polypeptide in wild-type cells but not in A-T cells containing mutations that truncate ATM upstream of the antibody binding sites. We show that ATM is almost exclusively nuclear and is expressed in all cell lines and tissues analysed. However, ATM levels are not regulated in response to u.v. or ionising radiation. These data are consistent with ATM being a component of the DNA damage detection apparatus rather than being an inducible downstream effector of the DNA damage response. In addition, we analyse ATM protein expression in a variety of A-T patients. Strikingly, ATM expression is reduced drastically or absent in all patients analysed, including those predicted to express proteins that should be detected by our antisera. Thus, the A-T phenotype may result not only from mutations that disrupt functional domains of ATM, but also from mutations that destabilise the ATM mRNA or protein. Finally, we report that a group of patients displaying an intermediate A-T phenotype express low levels of apparently full-length ATM. This suggests that the ATM pathway is partially active in these individuals and that there is a correlation between levels of residual ATM expression and disease severity.",Excluded
1532,"Online acid barrage stacking anti-salt injection for capillary electrophoresis of 9-fluorenymethylchloroformate-derivatized amino acids in high ionic strength solutions by UV detection An acid barrage stacking (ABS) method has been shown to be feasible for online anti-salt injection in CE of 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC)-labeled amino acids (AAs) detected by common UV absorption. The operation was performed on normal polar CE by sucking in an extra plug of acid following a sample zone, serving as a selective acid barrage to block the backward migration of weak anionic analytes due to a sudden mobility reduction via acid-base reaction which does not affect strong coions such as Cl<sup>-</sup> to penetrate the barrage freely. By CE-UV of FMOC-AAs in various NaCl solutions, the effectiveness of ABS was firmly validated, able to stand up to 500 mM NaCl and to stack analytes by 10<sup>3</sup>-fold calculated from the UV detection limits, that is 0.01 muM for ABS and 10 muM for non-stacking injection. The method was also validated by determining trace Glu and Asp in real samples of rat brain microdialysate, rat serum and human saliva. The intraday RSDs were 0.33-4.9% for migration time and 1.8-9.6% for peak area. The recoveries measured by spiking technique were 82-115% for Glu and 86-116% for Asp. Working equations were obtained by plotting peak height vs. concentration at 0.1-50 muM with correlation coefficients of >0.999. The contents of Glu and Asp were thus found at 0.26-0.83 muM and 0.24-0.64 muM respectively, in rat brain microdialyste; 37-40 muM and 8.4-10 muM, respectively, in rat serum; and 3.5-5.8 muM and 1.0-4.1 muM. respectively in human saliva.

GSC can be primary or radiation-induced and is an intra-axial brain lesion which often abuts a dural surface. While some GSC have indistinguishable imaging characteristics from glioblastoma, aggressive lesions can erode through the dura and skull and involve the extra-cranial soft tissues. We present the largest known imaging series of GSC with immunohistochemical and histologic correlation, documenting them as IDH(-) and delineating their imaging spectrum. Method(s): Pathology proved GSC cases were collected from our quaternary care center spanning the last 16 years. IDH status was either documented or obtained by staining tissue blocks. When available, p53, PTEN, MIB-1, EGFR amplification status, and MGMT methylation status were recorded and imaging findings tabulated. Result(s): 25 cases were identified, 21 were De novo, and 4 were radiation-induced. All lesions contacted a dural or pial surface. All cases were negative for an IDH R132H mutation, including post-radiation GSC. 16/16 cases showed non-amplification of EGFR/CEP7. MGMT methylation was present in 2/17.

Extensive research had been devoted to incriminate or absolve it as a health hazard. Radiofrequency radiation emitted by cell phone had been stated to be a potent carcinogen, cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic and neurobehavioral teratogen. Its effect on the brain had been a subject of extensive research evidently due to its proximity to the user's brain. While considering the biological effects of radiofrequency radiation, its intensity, frequency and the duration of exposure are important determinants. Nevertheless the results of these different studies have not been unequivocal. Considering the contradictory reports, the present work was undertaken to study the effect of such an exposure on the developing neural tissue of chick embryo. The processes of cell division and differentiation are fundamental to the development of any living being and are a sensitive index of any insult sustained at this stage. Neurons of dorsal root ganglion were selected for the present study as these ganglia were fully differentiated as early as fourth day of embryonic life. By varying duration of exposure, the embryos were exposed to different doses of radiation, sacrificed at different periods of incubation and subjected to histological processing. On light microscopic study it was observed that developing neurons of dorsal root ganglion suffered a damage which was dose dependent and persisted in spite of giving the exposure-free period between two exposures.",Excluded

All rats were given 0.2 ml of 59FeCl3, radioactivity 3.7 kBq. The animals were put to sleep with chloroform after 3 and 6 hours, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 14 days after the isotope administration. For the radiometric assays the following organs or tissues were taken: stomach, small and large intestine, liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, muscles, spleen, blood, brain, testicles. The results are given in the percent of Fe dose in 1 g of wet tissue. The statistical analysis (Students' t test) was performed. The results indicate that in poisoned animals the Fe distribution was different than in controls. Increased concentration of 59Fe was noted after 3 and 6 hours in stomach and after 1 day in large intestine, whereas in other organs the Fe concentration was lower, correlating usually with the Hg dose. One interesting thing was noted: the Fe concentration in almost all organs was higher in rats intoxicated with the 12 mg/kg dose of HgCl2 and given afterwards BAL (IV group), than in rats that were not given BAL.

Postimplantation routine imaging had failed to locate the missing seed, but he subsequently presented with back pain and parathesia with radiation down the leg.RESULTS: CT with bony windows and MRI had located the seed in the left L5 vertebral venous plexus. Neurosurgical intervention failed to locate and remove the migrated seed. Postsurgery, the left lower limb parathesia persisted but had normal nerve conduction studies. Dose to the spinal nerve roots and nearby structures were estimated using a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation. Serial X-ray imaging and CT had found that the seed had further migrated to left renal hilum.CONCLUSIONS: Seed migration to vertebral venous plexus is uncommon and to our knowledge this is the third reported case. Its subsequent migration to the renal hilum is most unusual. CT with bony windows or MRI are required if this is suspected. There is risk of spinal or nerve root damage and dose to these structures has to be estimated using GEANT4, although the tissue tolerance in the setting of low-dose rates are unknown and long-term followup of this patient is required.",Excluded

1803,"(R)-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, enhances tonic GABA inhibition in rat hippocampus Pharmacological agents that mediate a persistent GABAergic conductance are of considerable interest for treatment of epilepsy. (R)-roscovitine is a membrane permeable cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, designed to block cell division. It is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial as an anticancer drug. We show that (R)-roscovitine increases a tonic GABA-mediated current in rat hippocampal neurons. This enhanced tonic current appears independent of synaptic GABA release and requires functional transmembrane GABA transport. The effect of (R)-roscovitine is associated with neither modification of GABAA receptors nor protein kinase activity, but is associated with a significant increase in intracellular GABA concentration in hippocampal GABAergic neurons. (R)-roscovitine-induced tonic inhibition significantly suppresses spontaneous spiking activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, (R)-roscovitine is a potent modulator of neuronal activity in rat hippocampus and may provide a tool for preventing paroxysmal activity.",Excluded

The spleens of irradiated mice were removed aseptically and the splenocytes were extracted from the individual spleens and cultured. The micronuclei were prepared 72 hours after irradiation in binucleate splenocytes by blocking cytokinesis with cytochalasin-B. Irradiation of mice resulted in a dose-dependent elevation in the micronucleated splenocytes. The exposure of mice not only elevated splenocytes bearing one micronucleus but also cells bearing 2 and multiple (>2) micronuclei indicating induction of complex DNA damage after irradiation. Oral treatment of mice with 50 mg/kg body weight of jamun leaf extract protected against the radiation-induced micronuclei formation. Jamun extract also protected against the formation of 2 and multiple micronuclei indicating repair or inhibition of complex DNA damage. The assessment of lipid peroxidation in mice brain homogenate has indicated a concentration dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation by jamun extract. Studies in a cell free system revealed that jamun extract inhibited the formation of OH, O(2)-, DPPH, and ABTS(+) free radicals in a concentration dependent manner.

[French] Between 1962 and 1986, 32 patients with intracranial meningiomas were referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy for external radiotherapy either after incomplete surgery, or unfavorable histology (meningiosarcoma/anaplastic meningioma), or after recurrences. In the latter case, the mean time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence was 2 years (range: 1-6 years). Radiotherapy was performed using photons, electrons or mixed phetons-electrons. The mean total dose was 48 Gy (range: 9-65 Gy) delivered in a mean time of 35 days with a 19 mean number of fractions. Radiotherapy was interrupted in three cases at 9 Gy-17 Gy-20 Gy because of neurological worsening. The actuarial 5-year survival was 64%.

Eleven were infratentorial lesions (brain stem and cerebellum) and 6 supratentorial (thalamus, hippocampus, brain cortex and paraventricular region). Fifteen lesions bled once or twice. Two lesions revealed by focal epilepsy displayed a rim of hemosiderin on MRI. RS was performed for all 17 lesions. The risk of morbidity was considered too high for surgery in 13 patients and 2 patients wished to be treated by RS. RS was delivered by a 6 MeV linear accelerator with a conic collimators device. Stereotactic localization and dosimetry were carried out with STP system 3.O (Fischer-Liebinger TM, Germany). Doses ranged between 16 and 23 Gy, the lower doses being delivered to brain stem lesions. All the lesions received a single fraction isocentric radiation. Lesion volumes ranged between 0.7 and 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup>. Twelve lesions disappeared on MRI, the volume reduced (50-80%) in 3 lesions, and did not change in 2 lesions. Volume reduction was significant (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). In the follow up, 4 patients experienced bleeding, 1 of them died. Edema diagnosed in 2 patients at 3 and 13 months was treated by corticosteroids. The risk of hemorrhage without treatment in this group of patients was estimated about 34.45% a year. Hemorrhage incidence observed after RS was 7.17% (significant with P < 0.01, P < 0.001). At the end of follow up, 12 patients were symptom-free, 2 had sequels from bleeding, 1 patient died.

A lane change task was adopted to evaluate the driving performance; and the driving reaction time test and the reaction time test were adopted to evaluate the variation of the neuro-psychological cognitive functions. Both the sham and the real exposure conditions were performed with a 350 muT localized SMF in this study; 17 student subjects were enrolled in this single-blind experiment. Electroencephalographs (EEGs) of the subjects were adopted and recorded during the experiment as an indicator of the brain activity for the variations of the driving performance and of the cognitive functions. Results of this study have indicated that the impact of the given SMF on both the human driving performance and the cognitive functions are not considerable; and that there is a correlation between beta sub-band of the EEGs and the human reaction time in the analysis.,Excluded
1357,"Structural plasticity of the adult central nervous system: Insights from the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. [French] Accumulating evidence renders the dogma obsolete according to which the structural organization of the brain would remain essentially stable in adulthood, changing only in response to a need for compensatory processes during increasing age and degeneration. It has indeed become clear from investigations on various models that the adult nervous system can adapt to physiological demands by altering reversibly its synaptic circuits. This potential for structural and functional modifications results not only from the plastic properties of neurons but also from the inherent capacity of the glial cellular components to undergo remodeling as well. This is currently known for astrocytes, the major glial cells in brain which are well-recognized as dynamic partners in the mechanisms of synaptic transmission, and for the tanycytes and pituicytes which contribute to the regulation of neurosecretory processes in neurohemal regions of the hypothalamus. Studies on the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, whose role is central in homeostatic regulations, have gained good insights into the spectacular neuronal-glial rearrangements that may subserve functional plasticity in the adult brain. Following pioneering works on the morphological reorganizations taking place in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system under certain physiological conditions such as dehydration and lactation, studies on the gonadotropic system that orchestrates reproductive functions have re-emphasized the dynamic interplay between neurons and glia in brain structural plasticity processes. This review summarizes the major contributions provided by these researches in the field and also addresses the question of the morphological rearrangements that occur on a 24-h basis in the central component of the circadian clock responsible for the temporal aspects of endocrine regulations. Taken together, the reviewed data highlight the close cooperation between neurons and glia in developing strategies for functional adaptation of the brain to the changing conditions of the internal and external environment. © Societe de Biologie, 2011.",Excluded
1385,"Photon correlation spectroscopic study of the size distribution of phospholipid vesicles The dependence of phospholipid vesicle size on lipid composition is investigated by photon correlation spectroscopy. For each lipid composition prolonged ultracentrifugation was used to isolate a nearly uniform population of minimum-sized vesicles. The residual size variations in the samples were sufficient to cause polydispersity that made comparisons between samples difficult. Analyses of the data by the method of cumulants and by a method for approximating the particle size distributions directly are presented. The latter method made possible unambiguous comparisons that revealed small but systematic dependences of vesicle size on composition in vesicles containing mixtures of egg phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, egg phosphatidylcholine and beef brain sphingomyelin, and in single lipid vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, and beef brain sphingomyelin. These size dependences are quantified within the resolution limits of the technique and their implications are discussed.",Excluded
1344,"Offline Quality Assurance for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans for NRG-HN001 Head and Neck Clinical Trial Using Knowledge-Based Planning Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether a disease site-specific, multi-institutional knowledge based-planning (KBP) model can improve the quality of intensity modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for patients enrolled in the head and neck NRG-HN001clinical trial and to establish a threshold of improvements of treatment plans submitted to the clinical trial. Methods and Materials: Fifty treatment plans for patients enrolled in the NRG-HN001 clinical trial were used to build a KBP model; the model was then used to reoptimize 50 other plans. We compared the dosimetric parameters of the submitted and KBP reoptimized plans. We compared differences between KBP and submitted plans for single- and multi-institutional treatment plans. Result(s): Mean values for the dose received by 95% of the planning target volume (PTV_6996) and for the maximum dose (D0.03cc) of PTV_6996 were 0.5 Gy and 2.1 Gy higher in KBP plans than in the submitted plans, respectively. Mean values for D0.03cc to the brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerve_R, optic nerve_L, and chiasm were 2.5 Gy, 1.9 Gy, 6.4 Gy, 6.6 Gy, and 5.7 Gy lower in the KBP plans than in the submitted plans. Mean values for D<inf>mean</inf> to parotid_R and parotid_L glands were 2.2 Gy and 3.8 Gy lower in KBP plans, respectively. In 33 out of 50 KBP plans, we observed improvements in sparing of at least 7 organs at risk (OARs) (brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerves (R & L), chiasm, and parotid glands [R & L]). A threshold of improvement of OARs sparing of 5% of the prescription dose was established for providing the quality assurance results back to the treating institution. Conclusion(s): A disease site-specific, multi-institutional, clinical trial-based KBP model improved sparing of OARs in a large number of reoptimized plans submitted to the NRG-HN001 clinical trial, and the model is being used as an offline quality assurance tool.

2314,"Mapping by laser photostimulation of connections between the thalamic reticular and ventral posterior lateral nuclei in the rat We used laser scanning photostimulation through a focused UV laser of caged glutamate in an in vitro slice preparation through the rat's somatosensory thalamus to study topography and connectivity between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. This enabled us to focally stimulate the soma or dendrites of reticular neurons. We were thus able to confirm and extend previous observations based mainly on neuroanatomical pathway tracing techniques: the projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus have precise topography. The reticular zone, which we refer to as a ""footprint,"" within which photostimulation evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in relay cells, was relatively small and oval, with the long axis being parallel to the border between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. These evoked IPSCs were large, and by using appropriate GABA antagonists, we were able to show both GABA(A) and GABA(B) components. This suggests that photostimulation strongly activated reticular neurons. Finally, we were able to activate a disynaptic relay cell-to-reticular-to- relay cell pathway by evoking IPSCs in relay cells from photostimulation of the region surrounding a recorded relay cell. This, too, suggests strong responses of relay cells, responses strong enough to evoke spiking in their postsynaptic reticular targets. The regions of photostimulation for these disynaptic responses were much larger than the above-mentioned reticular footprints, and this suggests that reticulothalamic axon arbors are less widespread than thalamoreticular arbors, that there is more convergence in thalamoreticular connections than in reticulothalamic connections, or both.",Excluded
2321,"[The influence of age on radiation-induced cognitive deficit:experimental studies on brain irradiation of 30 gy in 10 sessions and 12 hours in the Wistar rat at 1 1/2, 4 and 18 months age] The objective of this study was to determine the influence of age on the learning and memory dysfunction induced by cranial radiation in the male Wistar rat. Ninety-six 45-day-old, 70 4-month-old, and 78 18-month-old male rats were divided in two equal groups: (i) irradiated and (ii) control. A course of whole-brain radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions over 12 days) was administered to the irradiated group, while the control group received sham irradiation. Sequential behavioral studies including one and two-way avoidance tests were undertaken before and after the 7 months following radiation. The results suggest that radiation induced progressive and irreversible memory dysfunction in elderly (18-month-old) rats, but this effect was partial or almost reversible in the 4-month-old and 45-day-old rats, respectively. In return, the learning dysfunction was age non-dependent despite the fact that is occurs more rapidly in the young (45 days, 4 months) rats.",Included
2322,"Radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction: The protective effect of ethyol in young rats Purpose: To evaluate the protective learning and memory effect of Ethyol in irradiated young rats. Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty-eight 45-day-old Wistar rats received whole brain fractionated radiation (30 Gy), whereas 48 rats received sham irradiation. Four irradiated subgroups were defined: saline, 37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg Ethyol. Sequential behavioral studies including one-way and two-way avoidance tasks were undertaken before and after radiation. Result(s): Before radiation, the performances of all groups were similar. For the one-way avoidance task, at 1, 3, and 6 months postradiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (75 or 150 mg/kg) irradiated rats (p <= 0.001). Nevertheless, lower percentage of avoidance (p <= 0.001) was only seen at 1 month postradiation in saline-irradiated rats, after comparison with their preradiation values. For the two-way avoidance task, performed only after radiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (150 or 75 mg/kg) irradiated rats at 1, 2.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months (p = 0.000). Rats treated with Ethyol did not differ from sham-irradiated rats in both avoidance tasks, except for the 37.5 mg/kg-Ethyol group which showed lower performances 6 months postradiation (p = 0.005, one-way avoidance). Conclusion(s): Treatment with 75 or 150 mg/kg of Ethyol prevents radiation-induced learning and transitory memory dysfunction in young rats. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.",Included
1285,"Vestibular adaptation to centrifugation does not transfer across planes of head rotation Out-of-plane head movements performed during fast rotation produce non-compensatory nystagmus, sensations of illusory motion, and often motion sickness. Adaptation to this cross-coupled Coriolis stimulus has previously been demonstrated for head turns made in the yaw (transverse) plane of motion, during supine head-on-axis rotation. An open question, however, is if adaptation to head movements in one plane of motion transfers to head movements performed in a new, unpracticed plane of motion. Evidence of transfer would imply the brain builds up a generalized model of the vestibular sensory-motor system, instead of learning a variety of individual input/output relations separately. To investigate, over two days 9 subjects performed pitch head turns (sagittal plane) while rotating, before and after a series of yaw head turns while rotating. A Control Group of 10 subjects performed only the pitch movements. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and sensations of illusory motion were recorded in the dark for all movements. Upon comparing the two groups we failed to find any evidence of transfer from the yaw plane to the pitch plane, suggesting that adaptation to cross-coupled stimuli is specific to the particular plane of head movement. The findings have applications for the use of centrifugation as a possible countermeasure for long duration spaceflight. Adapting astronauts to unconstrained head movements while rotating will likely require exposure to head movements in all planes and directions. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

It's incidence increases with age, slightly more in men than women. Less than 20% live longer than 1 year. Method(s): We present a case of a female patient who was diagnosed with a colo-rectal cancer. The cancer was staged as pT-3, N-0, M-0, G-2, R-0. He underwent a surgical intervention with colo-anal anastomosis. Than he was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: 5-FU and radiation. He was followed -up at the outpatient clinic of surgery. Two years later the patient complaint of back pain. A CT scan was performed, which found a solid lesion of the body of the pancreas with peripancreatic and truncus celiacus infiltration. Multiple liver metastes were found. A thoracic CT scan revealed metastatic lesions of both lungs, 7-8 mm in diameter. In these conditions the clinical diagnosis was made: Pancreatic cancer with pulmonary and liver metastatis, diabetes mellitus. Result(s): The stratification of the cancer showed a Stage 4 B, non resecable. The celiac plexus was accessed percutaneosly.

A battery of three different tests measured attention and short-term memory. Task 1 involved alternately selecting black digits from 1 to 25 in ascending order and white digits from 24 to 1 in descending order. The time spent on the task and the number of errors were recorded and analysed. Task 2 involved viewing a picture of 12 objects during 3 s, followed by a list of 24 words. The subject was required to select words representing previously presented objects.

2303,"Characterization of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) brain-type fatty acid binding protein (fabp7) genes reveals the fates of teleost fabp7 genes following whole genome duplications Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes. The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals, one (3R) at the base of the teleost radiation and another (4R) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids. We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein (fabp) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs. As previously described for zebrafish, we identified two copies (fabp7a and fabp7b) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt, but there was only a single transcript in northern pike, the closest relative of the salmonids, and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and grayling. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt, and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids. This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes. There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions. Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike. However, only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII, like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish, was expressed in the liver. A comparison of ~ 2000 bp upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62 bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII. The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1232,"Stereotactic LINAC radiosurgery for the treatment of brainstem cavernomas BACKGROUND: The management of deep-seated cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) is still controversial. Although surgery remains the treatment of choice in patients with recurrent hemorrhage, patients with CCMs located in the brainstem are in many cases not eligible for resection due to high procedure-related morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the long-term outcome of LINAC radiosurgery (LINAC-RS) for the treatment of brainstem CCMs.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1992 and March 2008, 14 patients (6 men, 8 women) harboring brainstem CCMs underwent LINAC-RS. Pretreatment neuroimaging showed no associated developmental venous angiomas (DVAs) in any of our patients. Prior to treatment, all patients suffered at least from one symptomatic hemorrhage (median 1.8, range 1-3). A median follow-up of 7.1 years (range 2.0-16.8 years) could be obtained in 12 patients. We applied a median tumor surface dose of 13.9 Gy (range 11-18 Gy; median tumor volume 1.6 ml, range 0.4-4.3 ml).RESULTS: Following LINAC-RS, neurological outcome improved in 4 (33.3%) and remained unchanged in 8 patients (66.7%). Rebleeding with subsequent transient neurological status deterioration occurred in 4 patients (33.3%), leading to additional surgical resection in 2 patients (16.7%). The corresponding annual hemorrhage rate was 4.8% (4/82.8 patient-years). Adverse radiation effects (ARE, defined by perilesional hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images) were revealed in 3 patients (25%), leading to transient neurological deficits in 2 patients (16.7%). There were no procedure-related complications leading to either permanent morbidity or mortality.CONCLUSION: Our results support the role of LINAC-RS as an efficient and safe treatment to significantly reduce the annual hemorrhage rate in patients suffering from brainstem CCMs not eligible to microsurgery.

1277,"Shifting and scaling adaptation to dynamic stimuli in somatosensory cortex Recent reports have shown that responses of midbrain neurons in the guinea pig rapidly shift the dynamic range of their responses to track changes in the statistics of ongoing sound-level distributions. This results in an increased coding accuracy for the most commonly occurring stimulus intensities. To investigate whether this type of adaptation might also be found in other sensory modalities, we characterized the intensity-response functions of neurons in rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to continuous sinusoidal vibration of the whiskers with amplitudes that were changed every 40 ms. Vibration amplitudes were selected randomly such that there was an 80% chance for the amplitude to be drawn from a relatively narrow 'high-probability region' (HPR). Stimulus mean and variance were then manipulated by shifting or widening the HPR. We found that rat S1 neurons adapt to shifts of the HPR mainly by shifting their thresholds, and to changes in HPR width by changing the slope of their rate-level curves. Using realistic single-neuron models, we go on to show that after-hyperpolarizing currents, such as those carried by K(Ca)(2+) channels, may be responsible for the threshold shifts, but not the slope changes.",Excluded

2025,"Stereotactic irradiation of the postoperative resection cavity for brain metastasis: a frameless linear accelerator-based case series and review of the technique PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard of care after resection of a brain metastasis. However, concern regarding possible neurocognitive effects and the lack of survival benefit with this approach has led to the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity in place of WBRT. We report our initial experience using an image-guided linear accelerator-based frameless stereotactic system and review the technical issues in applying this technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the setup accuracy, treatment outcome, and patterns of failure of the first 18 consecutive cases treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The target volume was the resection cavity without a margin excluding the surgical track.RESULTS: The median number of brain metastases per patient was 1 (range, 1-3). The median planning target volume was 3.49 mL. The median prescribed dose was 18 Gy (range, 15-18 Gy) with normalization ranging from 68% to 85%. In all cases, 99% of the planning target volume was covered by the prescribed dose. The median conformity index was 1.6 (range, 1.41-1.92). The SRS was delivered with submillimeter accuracy. At a median follow-up of 12.7 months, local control was achieved in 16/18 cavities treated. True local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. No marginal failures occurred. Distant recurrence occurred in 6/17 patients. Median time to any failure was 7.4 months. No Grade 3 or higher toxicity was recorded. A long interval between initial cancer diagnosis and the development of brain metastasis was the only factor that trended toward a significant association with the absence of recurrence (local or distant) (log-rank p = 0.097).CONCLUSIONS: Frameless stereotactic irradiation of the resection cavity after surgery for a brain metastasis is a safe and accurate technique that offers durable local control and defers the use of WBRT in select patients.

A large multicenter analysis was carried out to generate reliable safety data and elucidate the mechanism.METHODS: A total of 161 melanoma patients from 11 European skin cancer centers were evaluated for acute and late toxicity, of whom 70 consecutive patients received 86 series of radiotherapy with concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy. To further characterize and quantify a possible radiosensitization by BRAF inhibitors, blood samples of 35 melanoma patients were used for individual radiosensitivity testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization of chromosomal breaks after ex vivo irradiation.RESULTS: With radiotherapy and concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy the rate of acute radiodermatitis >=2degree was 36% and follicular cystic proliferation was seen in 13% of all radiotherapies. Non-skin toxicities included hearing disorders (4%) and dysphagia (2%). Following whole-brain radiotherapy, rates of radiodermatitis >=2degree were 44% and 8% (P < 0.001) for patients with and without BRAF inhibitor therapy, respectively. Concomitant treatment with vemurafenib induced acute radiodermatitis >=2degree more frequently than treatment with dabrafenib (40% versus 26%, P = 0.07). In line with these findings, analysis of chromosomal breaks ex vivo indicated significantly increased radiosensitivity for patients under vemurafenib (P = 0.004) and for patients switched from vemurafenib to dabrafenib (P = 0.002), but not for patients on dabrafenib only.

In addition, the underlying histopathologic changes to the tumor bed are not fully characterized. We seek to understand the clinical and histologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiation therapy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Four patients who underwent microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma after primary stereotactic radiation therapy.INTERVENTION: Patients were treated primarily with gamma knife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy followed by salvage microsurgery. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was used in all cases.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathologic review. Preoperative and postoperative facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann scale.RESULTS: We observed highly inconsistent radiation changes in the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal. Fibrosis outside and within the tumor bed varied markedly, complicating microsurgical dissection. Light microscopy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in all cases. Histopathologic features were typical of vestibular schwannoma, and there was no significant scarring that could be attributed to radiation effect.CONCLUSIONS: The variable fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle and lack of radiation changes seen histopathologically in irradiated vestibular schwannoma suggest that a uniform treatment effect was not achieved in these cases. Although all four patients with preoperative cranial neuropathies were found intraoperatively to have fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle, excellent preservation of facial nerve anatomy and function was possible with salvage microsurgical resection. Additional analyses are needed to clarify the histopathologic and molecular characteristics associated with vestibular schwannoma growth after stereotactic radiation. [References: 58]",Excluded

2143,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation of early visual cortex interferes with subjective visual awareness and objective forced-choice performance In order to study whether there exist a period of activity in the human early visual cortex that contributes exclusively to visual awareness, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the early visual cortex and measured subjective visual awareness during visual forced-choice symbol or orientation discrimination tasks. TMS produced one dip in awareness 60-120 ms after stimulus onset, while forced-choice orientation discrimination was suppressed between 60 and 90 ms and symbol discrimination between 60 and 120 ms. Thus, a time window specific to visual awareness was found only in the orientation condition at 120 ms. The results imply that both conscious and unconscious perception depend on activity in early visual areas. On the basis of previous estimates of neural processing speed, we suggest that the late part of the activity period most likely involve local extrastriate-striate interactions which provide the contents for visual awareness but are not themselves sufficient for awareness to arise.",Excluded
2068,"Effect of tumor treating fields on cell proliferation and synergistic antitumor efficacy in combination with ionizing radiation Alternating electric fields at an intermediate frequency (100~300 kHz), called tumor treating fields (TTFs), are reported to interrupt the process of mitosis via apoptosis and to act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Although the presence of an antimitotic effect of TTFs has been widely reported, the efficacy of TTFs is still controversial issue among medical experts. To resolve this controversial issue, the comparison study between the effects of TTFs and the effect of other conventional cancer treatment techniques need to be carried out. In this study, experimental evidence of the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTFs in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) is reported. For these experiments, aggressive brain cancer cells, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87), were treated either with TTFs alone, with IR alone or with TTFs followed by ionizing radiation (IR). The percentages of cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were increased by the application of TTFs alone and its quantity was markedly increased when TTFs were combined with IR. Our results also suggested that radiotherapy together with TTFs may be clinically beneficial since the combination treatment seemed to synergistically suppress both cell migration and invasion, based on the inhibition of MMP-9 and vimentin.",Excluded

In the same time, after chronic irradiation with equivalent dose (the accumulated dose was 3 Gy) the depletion of endothelial cell population, and multiple foci of minor pathological changes of endotheliocyte ultrastructure at as many as 50% of the population were revealed. It may be more likely to lead to reduction of tolerance of brain microvascular system to an acute radiation (10 Gy) in the late period after chronic exposure. The mechanism of impairment of brain microcirculation after low chronic irradiation will have to understand.",Included
1261,"Pathological circumstances impair the ability of ""dark"" neurons to undergo spontaneous recovery The effects of dehydrating drugs (furosemide, mannitol and glycerine), potassium channel modulators (tetraethylammonium chloride, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid Na salt, minoxidil and pinacidil), sodium channel modulators (veratridine, brevetoxin-9, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride and benzamil-HCl) and mitochondrial enzyme inhibitors (3-nitropropionic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenol and chloramphenicol) on the fate of electrically produced ""dark"" hippocampal dentate granule neurons were investigated. All but one (chloramphenicol) of these bioactive reagents substantially retarded the recovery and increased the death rate of such ""dark"" neurons. As concerns the dehydrating drugs and ion channel modulators, these effects are considered to be consequences of the fact that relatively large volumes (more than half of the original cell volume) of cytoplasmic fluid (water molecules, inorganic ions and metabolites) leave the affected cells through passive pores within a few minutes. The effects of the mitochondrial enzyme inhibitors appear to indicate that restoration of the original cell volume (recovery) demands metabolic (enzyme-mediated) energy. All these features support our previous assumption that the exogenous circumstances existing acutely after the formation of ""dark"" neurons in neurological diseases decide whether they will recover or die.",Excluded
1594,"Creativity and Cognition in Extreme Environments: The Space Arts as a Case Study Humans, like all organisms, have evolved to survive in specific environments, while some elect or are forced to live and work in extreme environments. Understanding cognition as it relates to environmental conditions, we use 4E cognition as a framework to explore creativity in extreme environments. Our paper examines space arts as a case study through the history, present practices, and future possible arts in the context of humans beyond the Karman boundary of the Earth's atmosphere. We develop a proposed taxonomy of space arts, based on prior taxonomies, and provide specific exemplars of space art developed by artists in space or for use by astronauts in space. Using examples of space art since the birth of the space age, we discuss (1) how human survival in extreme environments requires investment in the space arts, driven by consideration of various biopsychosocial factors and (2) how new scientific and engineering discoveries; such as the detection of air current patterns with paper airplanes in zero gravity, could be consequences or examples of creative thinking driven by artists in the various types of space art. We conclude by discussing possible benefits of space art, future research applications, and advocate that all space actors, government or private, involve artists in all projects beyond the Karman Boundary of the Earth's atmosphere.",Excluded
1560,"A phantom study to determine the optimum size of a single collimator for shortening the treatment time in CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery of spherical targets Prolonged treatment execution time is a concern in CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery. Beam reduction and node reduction technique, and monitor unit optimization methods are adopted to reduce the treatment time. Usage of single collimator in the CyberKnife treatment plan can potentially reduce collimator exchange time. An optimal single collimator, which yields an acceptable dose distribution along with minimum number of nodes, beams, and monitor units, can be a versatile alternative for shortening treatment time. The aim of the present study is to find the optimal single collimator in CyberKnife treatment planning to shorten the treatment time with the acceptable dose distribution. A spherical planning target volume PTV1 was drawn in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Plans with same treatment goals were generated for all the 12 collimators independently. D(95%) was selected as the prescribing isodose and the prescribed dose was 10 Gy. The plan of the optimal collimator size was evaluated for conformity, homogeneity, and dose spillage outside the target. The optimum collimator size and the target dimensions were correlated. The study was repeated with two other target volumes PTV2 and PTV3 for generalizing the results. Collimator sizes just above the diameter of the spherical PTVs were yielding least number of nodes and beams with acceptable dose distributions. The collimator size of 35 mm is optimum for the PTV1, whose diameter is 31.4 mm. Similarly, 50 mm collimator is optimum for PTV2 (diameter= 45.2 mm) and 20 mm collimator is optimum for PTV3 (Diameter = 17.3 mm). The total number of monitor units is found to reduce with increasing collimator size. Optimal single collimator is found to be useful for shortening the treatment time in spherical targets. Studies on two clinical targets, (a brain metastasis and a liver metastasis cases) show comparable results with the phantom study.",Excluded
1720,"Properties of paired-pulse firing thresholds and the relationship with paired-pulse plasticity in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses A large variability of paired-pulse plasticity (PPP) has been reported in CA3-CA1 synapses, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) has long been extensively used as a relative index of release probability (P(r)) from the presynaptic terminal. One of the most common ways of studying P(r) and PPP is to pass paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) through an electrode to fire an action potential (AP), which in turn opens Ca(2+) channels in the presynaptic boutons to evoke transmitter release. However, when the postsynaptic responses were elicited by electrical stimulations, the presynaptic APs were usually not monitored. The reliability of presynaptic activation, the difference of AP firing thresholds between the first and the second pulses of PPS, and its relationship with P(r) and PPP have been largely ignored. Here we show that the AP firing thresholds in the same CA3 pyramidal cells (axons) are obviously lower for the second pulses of the PPS than for the first pulses. When single (or small numbers of) presynaptic axons were stimulated by low-intensity PPS, a large variation in the postsynaptic response probability of the first pulses (P(res1)) and PPP was observed. Increasing stimulation intensities resulted in the conversion of a lower P(res1) and PPF to a higher P(res1) and paired-pulse depression. These results indicate that changes in the reliability of AP initiation by the first pulse of the PPS may account for the high variability of P(res1) and PPP observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, therefore PPF may not be a reliable index of P(r) .",Excluded
2253,"Development of a novel animal model to differentiate radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence Distinguishing tumor progression from radiation necrosis after treatment in patients with brain tumors presents a clinical dilemma. A well-characterized, orthotopic rodent model of radiation-induced brain necrosis including a tumor is not currently available The objective of the study was to create focal radiation necrosis in rat brain bearing human glioblastoma (GBM) using stereotactic radiosurgery and confirm it by immuno-histological analysis. Nude rats implanted with primary GBM cells were irradiated using a stereotactic setup (n = 3) or received no radiation (n = 3). Ten weeks after the implantation, growth of the tumor was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For each animal, MRI and contrast-enhanced CT images were obtained and fused using registration software. The tumor was identified and delineated using the fused CT/MR images. A treatment plan was generated using a 4 mm radiosurgery cone such that one portion of the tumor receives 100% dose of 60 Gy sufficient to cause necrosis, whereas the tumor edge at depth receives only 50% or less dose, allowing for regrowth of the tumor. The brains were collected 10 weeks after irradiation and immuno-histological analysis was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed central liquefaction necrosis in the high dose region consistent with necrosis and viable tumor in the peripheral low dose region. Ki-67 staining showed highly proliferative tumor cells surrounding the necrotic parts of the tumor. Luxol fast blue and lectin staining showed demyelination and vascular injury in brain tissue consistent with radiation necrosis.

1749,"Variability in EMF permittivity values: implications for SAR calculations Digital anatomical models of man and animals are available for use in numerical calculations to predict electromagnetic field (EMF)-induced specific absorption rate (SAR) values. To use these models, permittivity values are assigned to the various tissues for the EMF frequencies of interest. There is, as yet, no consensus on what are the best permittivity data. This study analyzed the variability in published permittivity data and investigated the effects of permittivity values that are proportional on SAR calculations. Whole-sphere averaged and localized SAR values along the diameter of a 4-cm sphere are calculated for EMF exposures in the radio frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 GHz. When the dimensions of a sphere are small compared to the wavelength (i.e., wavelength inside the material is greater than ten times the dimensions of the object), the whole-sphere averaged SAR is inversely proportional to the permittivity of the material composing the sphere. However, the localized SAR values generally do not have the same relation and, as a matter of fact, vary greatly depending on the location within the sphere. These results indicate that care must be taken in choosing the permittivity values used in calculating SAR values and some estimate of the dependence of the calculated SAR values on variability in permittivity should be determined.",Excluded

However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta)<sub>1-40</sub> and Abeta <sub>1-42</sub> isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Abeta. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Abeta<sub>1-40</sub> and Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.",Excluded
1552,"The excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist MK-801 prevents the hypersensitivity induced by spinal cord ischemia in the rat Protection by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 against transient spinal cord ischemia-induced hypersensitivity was studied in rats. The spinal ischemia was initiated by vascular occlusion resulting from the interaction between the photosensitizing dye Erythrosin B and an argon laser beam. The hypersensitivity, termed allodynia, where the animals reacted by vocalization to nonnoxious mechanical stimuli in the flank area, was consistently observed during several days after induction of the ischemia. Pretreatment with MK-801 (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, iv) 10 min before laser irradiation dose dependently prevented the occurrence of allodynia. The neuroprotective effect of MK-801 was not reduced by maintaining normal body temperature during and after irradiation. There was a significant negative correlation between the delay in the administration of MK-801 after irradiation and the protective effect of the drug. Histological examination revealed slight morphological damage in the spinal cord in 38% of control rats after 1 min of laser irradiation without pretreatment with MK-801. No morphological abnormalities were observed in rats after pretreatment with MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg).

1822,"Equivalent outcomes with hypofractionated, accelerated thoracic radiation therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Does this represent a reasonable strategy in patients unable to attend twice daily treatment? Purpose/Objective(s): The publication of RTOG 8815 established hyperfractionated, twice-daily thoracic radiation therapy (BID RT) with concurrent platinum-etoposide (PE) as the standard of care in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, many patients with this aggressive, often debilitating malignancy find BID RT intolerable due to both physical and logistical limitations. As an alternative, patients unable to receive BID RT are treated with daily 3Gy fractions (QD RT) to a total dose of 45Gy at our institution.We hypothesized that hypofractionated QD RT in the setting of concurrent PE would be as safe and effective as BID RT. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with LS-SCLC treated with curative intent. Patients received 45Gy either QD (3Gy) or BID (1.5Gy) with concurrent PE. Covariables reviewed include age, gender, race, insurance status, year of diagnosis, 3D vs IMRT planning, PTV volume, chemotherapy agents and cycles, RT dose and fractionation, incidence of Grade >=2 radiation pneumonitis and subsequent delivery of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare the characteristics of treatment groups for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were generated, with accompanying univariate (UVA) log-rank and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-six patients were evaluable, with a median follow-up of 13 months for the entire cohort (range 3-79), and a median follow-up of 18.5 months for survivors (range 7-73). 88% of patients were deceased at last follow-up. For the entire cohort, median age was 63 years (range 54-81). 24 (67%) patients received BID RT; 12 (33%) received QD RT. BID and QD groups were balanced with respect to age, race, sex, insurance status, PTV volume, and 3D vs IMRT planning. One patient in each group was treated with corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. No significant differences were observed for PFS or OS outcomes. 2-year PFS was 13.4% (BID) vs 16.7% (QD) (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-1.67; p<.61) and 2-year OS was 34.5% (BID) vs 31.7% (QD) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.28-1.86; p<.51). Neither the incidence of Grade >= 2 radiation pneumonitis (p=0.61) nor utilization of PCI (BID 58% vs 50% QD, p=0.64) differed between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In this single-institution study, hypofractionated QD RT to 45Gy delivered with concurrent PE was associated with toxicity and outcomes comparable to BID RT with concurrent PE. Further validation with a larger, prospective dataset is warranted. Daily hypofractionated thoracic RT with concurrent chemotherapy represents a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot be treated twice daily.",Excluded

We evaluated the efficacy of CT and RT in patients with IDH mutant, 1p19q-noncodeleted secondary high-grade astrocytoma (sHGA) WHO grades III and IV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment data from 109 patients with sHGA grades III and IV, developed from histologically confirmed low-grade astrocytoma grade II were retrospectively analyzed. IDH mutation-, 1p19q/codeletion- and MGMT-promoter methylation status were evaluable in all patients. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in relation to adjuvant treatment modalities and molecular profiling were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULT(S): Out of 109 patients, 88 patients (80.7%) harbored an IDH1 or 2 mutations, 30 patients a 1p19q-codeletion (27.5%), and 63 patients (57.8%) exhibited a methylated MGMT-promoter status. During the follow-up time 57 patients (52.2%) died. The postsurgical treatment for the 88 IDH mutant sHGA included: RT alone in 17 patients (19.3%), a combined RT and CT (RCT) in 48 patients (54.5%) and CT alone in 20 patients (22.7%). 3 patients did not receive any adjuvant treatment due to bad neurological conditions. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, the median OS of all IDH mutant sHGA was 5.67 years (1.9-17.4 years). The OS in patients who received RCT was 6.4 years, which is significantly longer compared with those who underwent RT alone (1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.51. p = 0.011). After including only IDH mutant sHGA patients without a 1p19q-codeletion, the Kaplan-Meier curves estimates a significantly improved OS in the RCT cohort (33 patients) in comparison to patients who received RT alone (10 patients) (6.4 vs 1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.34-0.6, p= 0.022).

2245,"Novel egfr/DNA binary targeting molecule zrba1 potentiates radiation response in glioblastoma tumor model Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans with a poor clinical outcome. Although no contemporary therapies are completely curative combined chemo-radiation (STUPP) has led to improved overall survival. Therefore development of new targeted drugs and their combination with radiation offer new treatment possibilities. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the radiosensitizing abilities of ZRBA1combi-molecule designed to block bothEGFR-TKsignaling pathways while additionally inducing significant levels of DNA damage. In cancer cells the binary property ofZRBA1can be limited byDNArepair mechanismtherefore in order to increase its efficacy we combined this drug with ionizing radiation. The effect of ZRBA1 on the radiosensitivity of three human glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U343 and U373) was evaluated using MTT and clonogenic assays whereas DNA damage/repair and cell cycle were evaluated using gH2AX antibody and FACS assay. Our results demonstrate that exposure of cells to 25uM of ZRBA1 resulted in an increase in radiosensitivity of all tested cell lines with dose enhancement factors at a surviving fraction of 0.1 ranging from 1.4 to 1.7. Importantly, in contrast to Temozolomide which enhances radiation response most effectively in MGMT-negative cells, radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 does not depend on theMGMTmethylation status. Additionally, as a measure ofDNAdouble strand breaks, the number of gH2AXfoci per cell was significantly greater at 24h after the combined modality compared with the individual treatments with radiation, Temozolomide or ZRBA1 alone. Overall, our results have demonstrated of increased levels of DNA double strand breaks when ZRBA1 was combined with radiation and suggests that the radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 relay on inhibition of DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Therefore we postulate that ZRBA1 may be developed as a potent and innovative radiosensitizing agent for malignant glioma tumors.",Excluded

Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography is well suited for repeated clinical examinations in patients with systemic diseases such as vasculitis or atherosclerosis and can also be used for scientific purposes. On the basis of the WBMRA overview, a possible further development of the WBMRA concept can be to perform further acquisitions at sites with atherosclerotic plaques with higher-resolution scans to determine the degree of stenosis more accurately or to achieve plaque characterization. A total validation of WBMRA compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is not possible owing to the hazards of ionizing radiation. Studies have shown a high sensitivity and specificity for the pelvic and lower limb arteries in comparison with DSA. No systematic validation against DSA has been performed for the renal, aortic, and carotid arteries. Various methods have been used, however, for confirmation of vascular abnormalities found on WBMRA such as ultrasonography, dedicated MRA, or DSA, with reasonably high agreement. The WBMRA method has not been studied with regard to prediction of future cardiovascular (CV) events, as have intima media thickness, coronary artery calcium scoring, and the ankle-brachial index.

This study aimed to determine the recommended dose of weekly nedaplatin chemoradiotherapy in high-risk patients following radical surgery. Fifteen patients who required postoperative pelvic radiotherapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer were enrolled in the present study. Nedaplatin was designed to be administered for eight cycles (minimum five cycles) beginning at a weekly dose of 22.5 mg/m(2) and then escalating to 25, 27.5, and then to 30 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy and/or planned chemotherapy (prior to the completion of five cycles) due to toxicity. Nedaplatin administration was interrupted prior to the completion of five cycles in one of six patients at a dose of 27.5 mg/m(2). A more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy did not occur in any patient. Nedaplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) was safely administered, and two of three patients could receive the planned chemotherapy consisting of eight cycles of weekly nedaplatin.

1504,"Nontraumatic vascular emergencies: Imaging and intervention in acute occlusion Risk factors for acute venous occlusion range from prolonged immobilization to hypercoagulability syndromes, trauma, and malignancy. The aim of this review article is to illustrate the different imaging options for the diagnosis of acute venous occlusion and to assess the value of interventional strategies for venous thrombosis treatment in an emergency setting. First, diagnosis and treatment of the most common form of venous occlusion, at the level of the lower extremities, is presented, followed by pelvic vein and inferior vena cava occlusion, mesenteric venous thrombosis, upper extremity occlusion, acute cerebral vein thrombosis, and finally acute venous occlusion of hemodialysis access. In acute venous occlusion of the lower extremity phlebography is still the reference gold standard. Presently, duplex ultrasound with manual compression is the most sensitive and specific noninvasive test. Limitations of ultrasonography include isolated distal calf vein occlusion, obesity, and patients with lower extremity edema. If sonography is non-diagnostic, venography should be considered. Magnetic resonance venography can differentiate an acute occlusion from chronic thrombus, but because of its high cost and limited availability, it is not yet used for the routine diagnosis of lower extremity venous occlusion only. Regarding interventional treatment, catheter-directed thrombolysis can be applied to dissolve thrombus in charily selected patients with symptomatic occlusion and no contraindications to therapy. Acute occlusion of the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, often due to extension from the femoropopliteal system, represents a major risk for pulmonary embolism. Color flow Doppler imaging is often limited owing to obesity and bowel gas. Venography has long been considered the gold standard for identifying proximal venous occlusion. Both CT scanning and MR imaging, however, can even more accurately diagnose acute pelvis vein or inferior vena cava occlusion. MRI is preferred because it is noninvasive, does not require contrast agent, carries no exposure to ionizing radiation, and is highly accurate and reproducible. Apart from catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy has proven to be a quick and safe treatment modality by enabling the recanalization of thrombotic occlusions in conjunction with minimal invasiveness and a low bleeding risk. Mechanical thrombectomy devices should only be used in conjunction with a temporary cava filter. Contrast-enhanced CT is at present considered the examination of choice for acute mesenteric vein occlusion which has mortality rates as high as 80%. Patients with proven acute mesenteric venous occlusion and contraindications to surgical therapy and no identified bleeding disposition without looming bowel ischemia or infarction are possible contenders to the less invasive percutaneous approach either by (in)direct thrombolysis or mechanical means. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of upper extremity thrombosis. Computed tomography and MRI are in addition helpful in diagnosing central chest vein occlusions. The interventionalist is rarely involved in the treatment of this entity. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is known to improve lysis rates. Together with balloon angioplasty good results have been obtained. If stenosis or thrombus remains after thrombolysis and angioplasty, stent placement should follow. Within the first two weeks, thrombosed dural sinus and cerebral venous vessels are typically hyperdense on CT compared with brain parenchyma; after the course of 2 weeks, the thrombus will become isodense. In MRI an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, an axial diffusion-weighted MRI, coronal T1-weighted spinecho and T2-weighted turbo-spinecho sequences, a coronal gradientecho and a 3D phase-contrast venous angiogram should be performed. Local thrombolysis is needed only when patients have an exacerbation of clinical symptoms or imaging signs of worsening disease despite sufficient anticoagulation therapy. Acute occlusions of dialysis grafts and fistulae are a frequently encountered complication. Among the various methods described for acute occlusion screening, ultrasonography and MRI have been proven to be accurate and noninvasive; however, if immediate treatment can be anticipated, imaging should be performed directly by digital subtraction angiography before the percutaneous intervention. Initial percutaneous thrombectomy is very effective with success rates and patency rates comparable to those of surgical thrombectomy. A short thrombosis can be treated with balloon angioplasty alone, whereas an extensive thrombosis requires a combination of mechanical devices and/or thrombolytic agents with adjunctive balloon angioplasty.",Excluded
2163,"Secondary radiation damage as the main cause for unexpected volume effects: a histopathologic study of the parotid gland PURPOSE: To elucidate with a histopathological study the mechanism of region-dependent volume effects in the partly irradiated parotid gland of the rat.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Wistar rats were locally X-irradiated with collimators with conformal radiation portals for 100% volume and 50% cranial/caudal partial volumes. Single doses up to 40 Gy were applied. Parotid saliva samples were collected, and the three lobes of the parotid gland were examined individually on the macro- and micromorphologic level up to 1 year after irradiation.RESULTS: Dose-dependent loss of gland weight was observed 1 year after total or partial X-irradiation. Weight loss of the glands correlated very well with loss of secretory function. Irradiating the cranial 50% volume (implicating a shielded lateral lobe) resulted in substantially more damage in terms of weight loss and loss of secretory function than 50% caudal irradiation (shielding the ventral and dorsal lobe). Histologic examinations of the glands 1 year after irradiation revealed that the shielded lateral lobe was severely affected, in contrast to the shielded ventral and dorsal lobes. Time studies showed that irradiation of the cranial 50% volume caused late development of secondary damage in the shielded lateral lobe, becoming manifest between 240 and 360 days after irradiation. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the observed region-dependent volume effect for late function loss in the rat parotid gland after partial irradiation is mainly caused by secondary events in the shielded lateral lobe. The most probable first step (primary radiation event) in the development of this secondary damage is radiation exposure to the hilus region (located between the ventral and dorsal lobe). By injuring major excretory ducts and supply routes for blood and nerves in this area, the facility system necessary for proper functioning of the nonexposed lateral lobe is seriously affected. The unexpected volume effect in the rat might have consequences for treatment strategies in radiotherapy, implicating not only salivary glands but also other organs with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of radiosensitive elements, a situation wherein volume effects have not been anticipated up to now.",Included

The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that D609 would provide neuroprotection against free radical oxidative stress in vivo. Synaptosomes isolated from gerbils, previously injected intraperitoneally (ip) with D609, were treated with the oxidants Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or 2,2-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), which produce free radicals. Synaptosomes isolated from the gerbils ip injected with D609 and treated with Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or AAPH showed significant reduction in reactive oxygen species, levels of protein carbonyl, protein-bound hydroxynonenal (a lipid peroxidation product), and 3-nitrotyrosine (another marker of protein oxidation formed by reaction of tyrosine residues with peroxynitrite) compared to oxidative stress in synaptosomes isolated from gerbils that were injected with saline, but treated with Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or AAPH.

2494,"Using superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics to manipulate the redox environment of neural precursor cells Past work has shown that neural precursor cells are predisposed to redox sensitive changes, and that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the acute and persistent changes that occur within the irradiated CNS. Irradiation leads to a marked rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that correlates with oxidative endpoints in vivo and reductions in neurogenesis. To better understand the impact of oxidative stress on neural precursor cells, and to determine if radiation-induced oxidative damage and precursor cell loss after irradiation could be reduced, a series of antioxidant compounds (EUK-134, EUK-163, EUK-172, EUK-189) were tested, three of which possess both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and one (EUK-163) whose only significant activity is SOD. Our results show that these SOD/catalase mimetics apparently increase the oxidation of a ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye, particularly after short (12 h) treatments, but that longer treatments (24 h) decrease oxidation attributable to radiation-induced ROS. Similarly, other studies found that cells incubated with CuZnSOD showed some increase in intracellular ROS levels. Subsequent data suggested that the dye-oxidising capabilities of the EUK compounds were linked to differences in their catalase activity and, most likely, their ability to catalyse peroxidative pathways. In unirradiated mice, the EUK-134 analogue induced some decrease of proliferating precursor cells and immature neurons 48 h after radiation, an effect that may be attributable to cytotoxicity and/or inhibition of precursor proliferation. In irradiated mice, a single injection of EUK-134 was not found to be an effective radioprotector at acute times (48 h). The present results support continued development of our in vitro model as a tool for predicting certain in vivo responses, and suggest that in some biological systems the capability to scavenge superoxide but produce excess H(2)O(2), as is known for CuZnSOD, may be potentially deleterious. Our results also show that the ability of catalase mimetics, like true catalases, to catalyse peroxidase reactions can complicate the interpretation of data obtained with certain fluorescent ROS-indicator dyes.",Included
1392,"Hippocampal dosimetry predicts neurocognitive function impairment after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for benign or low-grade adult brain tumors PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the association between hippocampal dose and long-term neurocognitive function (NCF) impairment for benign or low-grade adult brain tumors treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients with benign or low-grade adult brain tumors were treated with FSRT per institutional practice. No attempt was made to spare the hippocampus. NCF testing was conducted at baseline and 18 months follow-up, on a prospective clinical trial. Regression-based standardized z scores were calculated by using similar healthy control individuals evaluated at the same test-retest interval. NCF impairment was defined as a z score <=-1.5. After delineation of the bilateral hippocampi according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contouring atlas, dose-volume histograms were generated for the left and right hippocampi and for the composite pair. Biologically equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions (EQD(2)) assuming an alpha/beta ratio of 2 Gy were computed. Fisher's exact test and binary logistic regression were used for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Dose-response data were fit to a nonlinear model.RESULTS: Of 29 patients enrolled in this trial, 18 completed both baseline and 18-month NCF testing. An EQD(2) to 40% of the bilateral hippocampi >7.3 Gy was associated with impairment in Wechsler Memory Scale-III Word List (WMS-WL) delayed recall (odds ratio [OR] 19.3; p = 0.043). The association between WMS-WL delayed recall and EQD(2) to 100% of the bilateral hippocampi >0.0 Gy trended to significance (OR 14.8; p = 0.068).CONCLUSION: EQD(2) to 40% of the bilateral hippocampi greater than 7.3 Gy is associated with long-term impairment in list-learning delayed recall after FSRT for benign or low-grade adult brain tumors. Given that modern intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques can reduce the dose to the bilateral hippocampi below this dosimetric threshold, patients should be enrolled in ongoing prospective trials of hippocampal sparing during cranial irradiation to confirm these preliminary results.",Excluded

The brains of embryos on day 17 and offspring at 2, 3 and 8 weeks after birth were processed for BrdU immunohistochemistry to trace the movements of BrdU-labeled cells. The location of BrdU-labeled neurons in the cerebral cortex was quantitatively analyzed between irradiated animals and non-irradiated controls. We have demonstrated that the initial migration of BrdU-labeled cells from the matrix cell zone towards the cortical plate during embryonic periods was decelerated when exposed to X-rays of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Gy on embryonic day 14, and that aberrantly placed neurons in the cerebral neocortex were noted in younger animals that were irradiated prenatally, whereas such derangement was less pronounced in mature animals.

2312,"186Re-HEDP for metastatic bone pain in breast cancer patients Two-thirds of patients with metastatic cancer suffer from pain. Pain originating from skeletal metastases is the most common form of cancer-related pain. Bone pain, often exacerbated by pressure or movement, limits the patient's autonomy and social life. Pain palliation with bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals has proven to be an effective treatment modality in patients with metastatic bone pain. These bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals are extremely powerful in treating scattered painful bone metastases, for which external beam radiotherapy is impossible because of the large field of irradiation. (186)Re-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP) is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for this purpose, having numerous advantageous characteristics. Bone marrow toxicity is limited and reversible, which makes repetitive treatment safe. Studies have shown encouraging clinical results of palliative therapy using (186)Re-HEDP, with an overall response rate of ca. 70% in painful bone metastases. It is effective for fast palliation of painful bone metastases from various tumours and the effect tends to last longer if patients are treated early in the course of their disease. (186)Re-HEDP is at least as effective in breast cancer patients with painful bone metastases as in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. It is to be preferred to radiopharmaceuticals with a long physical half-life in this group of patients, who tend to have more extensive haematological toxicity since they have frequently been pretreated with bone marrow suppressive chemotherapy. This systemic form of radionuclide therapy is simple to administer and complements other treatment options. It has been associated with marked pain reduction, improved mobility in many patients, reduced dependence on analgesics, and improved performance status and quality of life.

1997,"Opsin co-expression in Limulus photoreceptors: differential regulation by light and a circadian clock A long-standing concept in vision science has held that a single photoreceptor expresses a single type of opsin, the protein component of visual pigment. However, the number of examples in the literature of photoreceptors from vertebrates and invertebrates that break this rule is increasing. Here, we describe a newly discovered Limulus opsin, Limulus opsin5, which is significantly different from previously characterized Limulus opsins, opsins1 and 2. We show that opsin5 is co-expressed with opsins1 and 2 in Limulus lateral and ventral eye photoreceptors and provide the first evidence that the expression of co-expressed opsins can be differentially regulated. We show that the relative levels of opsin5 and opsin1 and 2 in the rhabdom change with a diurnal rhythm and that their relative levels are also influenced by the animal's central circadian clock. An analysis of the sequence of opsin5 suggests it is sensitive to visible light (400-700 nm) but that its spectral properties may be different from that of opsins1 and 2. Changes in the relative levels of these opsins may underlie some of the dramatic day-night changes in Limulus photoreceptor function and may produce a diurnal change in their spectral sensitivity.",Excluded
2404,"Acute remapping within the motor system induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of human primary motor cortex (M1) changes cortical excitability at the site of stimulation and at distant sites without affecting simple motor performance. The aim of this study was to explore how rTMS changes regional excitability and how the motor system compensates for these changes. Using functional brain imaging, activation was mapped at rest and during freely selected finger movements after 30 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS increased synaptic activity in the stimulated left M1 and induced widespread changes in activity throughout areas engaged by the task. In particular, movement-related activity in the premotor cortex of the nonstimulated hemisphere increased after 1 Hz rTMS. Analyses of effective connectivity confirmed that the stimulated part of M1 became less responsive to input from premotor and mesial motor areas. Conversely, after rTMS our results were consistent with increased coupling between an inferomedial portion of left M1 and anterior motor areas. These results are important for three reasons. First, they show changes in motor excitability to central inputs from other cortical areas (as opposed to peripheral or exogenous inputs used in previous studies). Second, they suggest that maintenance of task performance may involve activation of premotor areas contralateral to the site of rTMS, similar to that seen in stroke patients. Third, changes in motor activations at the site of rTMS suggest an rTMS-induced remodeling of motor representations during movement. This remapping may provide a neural substrate for acute compensatory plasticity of the motor system in response to focal lesions such as stroke.",Excluded
1346,"Influence of surface pattern and sterilisation of solvent-cast films for peripheral nerve guidance INTRODUCTION : Damage to peripheral nerves can result in considerable morbidity and loss of function. Poly-(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/poly-(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) blend nerve guidance conduits are a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury1. The surface morphology of scaffolds is known to influence their physical properties and cell behaviour. Yet, as scaffolds progress further towards clinical trials, it is imperative that they are subjected to/and capable of withstanding approved sterilisation methods, such as gamma irradiation, without causing detrimental effects to the material physical properties and/or cell response. This study investigates how surface patterns affect PCL films and aims to assess whether PCL/PLA blend scaffolds are able to withstand gamma irradiation sufficient for medical sterilisation. METHOD(S): PCL and PCL/PLA (4:1 w/w) blend solutions were prepared using dichloromethane (3% w/v). Smooth, pitted and micro-grooved PCL films were cast and imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while tensile testing was used to quantify their mechanical properties (Instron 1122, load cell 0.010 kN). NG108-15 cells were cultured up to 14 days on the various PCL film surfaces before fluorescence and SEM imaging were performed both to confirm biocompatibility and observe cell behaviour. PCL/PLA blend films will be sterilised at 7 incremental doses of gamma radiation (15-45 kGy) (Isotron). Mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography will be utilised to evaluate any changes in material properties or structure in comparison to unirradiated control samples. RESULT(S): The mean thickness of all types of solvent-cast film was less than 100 mum. The average porosity of the pitted PCL films was 53% with 2.1+/-0.5 mum diameter pits. Smooth films were significantly stronger, with greater modulus and strain (Table 1*p<0.01). NG108-15 cells attached and proliferated on the PCL films in vitro up to 14 days. However, only on the grooved samples did cells display organisation, demonstrating alignment in the same orientation as the grooves (Fig. 1). (Table presented) Discussion & CONCLUSION(S): These findings support the use of solvent cast PCL films for fabricating nerve guides. Pits in the surface of the inner lumen are beneficial in cell growth and grooved surfaces enable the alignment of neurons. In this work all patterned surfaces had sufficient tensile strength to function as nerve conduits. PCL/PLA blended films were tested to see whether they would withstand medical-grade sterilisation. It is hypothesised that the polymer films will not be significantly affected by gamma irradiation.",Excluded
1459,"Fractionated radiosurgery for painful spinal metastases: DOSIS - a phase II trial BACKGROUND: One third of all cancer patients will develop bone metastases and the vertebral column is involved in approximately 70% of these patients. Conventional radiotherapy with of 1-10 fractions and total doses of 8-30 Gy is the current standard for painful vertebral metastases; however, the median pain response is short with 3-6 months and local tumor control is limited with these rather low irradiation doses. Recent advances in radiotherapy technology - intensity modulated radiotherapy for generation of highly conformal dose distributions and image-guidance for precise treatment delivery - have made dose-escalated radiosurgery of spinal metastases possible and early results of pain and local tumor control are promising. The current study will investigate efficacy and safety of radiosurgery for painful vertebral metastases and three characteristics will distinguish this study. 1) A prognostic score for overall survival will be used for selection of patients with longer life expectancy to allow for analysis of long-term efficacy and safety. 2) Fractionated radiosurgery will be performed with the number of treatment fractions adjusted to either good (10 fractions) or intermediate (5 fractions) life expectancy. Fractionation will allow inclusion of tumors immediately abutting the spinal cord due to higher biological effective doses at the tumor - spinal cord interface compared to single fraction treatment. 3) Dose intensification will be performed in the involved parts of the vertebrae only, while uninvolved parts are treated with conventional doses using the simultaneous integrated boost concept.METHODS / DESIGN: It is the study hypothesis that hypo-fractionated image-guided radiosurgery significantly improves pain relief compared to historic data of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Primary endpoint is pain response 3 months after radiosurgery, which is defined as pain reduction of >= 2 points at the treated vertebral site on the 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale. 60 patients will be included into this two-centre phase II trial.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study will refine the methods of patient selection, target volume definition, treatment planning and delivery as well as quality assurance for radiosurgery.

We tested the hypothesis that artificial gravity from a short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC) could provide cerebral and cardiovascular stimuli similar to upright posture and thereby serve as a suitable countermeasure.METHODS: We compared cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses before, during, and after exposure to hyper-G with that of standing in healthy young participants. The head was positioned such that the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was 0.46 m from the center of rotation. Two levels of hyper-G that provided 1g and 2g at foot level were investigated. Continuous blood pressure, heart rate, calf blood volume, MCA mean blood flow velocity (MFV) and end-tidal CO2 were measured.RESULTS: Blood pressure at the level of the MCA (BP-MCA) and MFV was reduced during stand and at 2g. The relationship between MFV and BP-MCA at 2g was different from supine and similar to standing, while 1g centrifugation was not different from supine. The cardiovascular system was also not different from supine at 1g but was similarly challenged in 2g compared to stand.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that short-arm centrifugation 2g at the feet, with the head offset 0.5 m from the center, provides similar cardiovascular and cerebral responses to standing. This supports the hypothesis that passive 2g SAHC exposure at the feet could be used as a countermeasure for in-flight cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deconditioning.",Excluded

To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded

Male adult rats were divided into control rats (n=6), SMF-exposed rats (128 mT; 1h/day for 5 days), selenium-treated rats (Na(2)SeO(3), 0.2mg/l, in drinking water for 4 weeks) and co-exposed rats (selenium for 4 weeks and SMF during the last 5 consecutive days). Sub-acute exposure to SMF induces a decrease of selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain. Our results also revealed a decrease of GPx activities in kidney and muscle. By contrast, SMF exposure increased total GSH levels and total SOD activities in liver, while glutathione reductase activity is unaffected. Selenium supplementation in SMF-exposed rats restored selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain and elevated the activities of GPx in kidney and muscle to those of control group. In the liver, selenium supplementation failed to bring down the elevated levels of total GSH and SOD activity.

The celiac plexus is a network of nociceptive nerves, located along the aorta. Contemporary approaches (opioids, celiac plexus chemical neurolysis, systemic chemotherapy) are often inadequate. The celiac plexus has not previously been targeted using radiation. We hypothesized that ablative radiation targeted to the celiac plexus would alleviate pain. Method(s): We conducted a single arm prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients had celiac-pain > 4/10 on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), ECOG <= 3, no previous abdominal RT, and were evaluable if they completed treatment per protocol with at least one post-treatment visit. The celiac plexus was irradiated from D12 to L2. Radiation was given as either five fractions of 9 Gy or a single-fraction 25 Gy. The primary endpoint was NRS pain 3 weeks post-treatment. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, pain at 6w, analgesic use, and pain interference with daily activities as evaluated by 'Brief Pain Inventory' before and after radiation. Result(s): 21 patients were evaluable: 2 received fractionated treatment, 19 received 25Gy single fraction. The median age of the study population was 63 yr with a median ECOG of 1, 86% had pancreatic cancer. Patients were a median of 8 months out from diagnosis, and had received a median of one systemic treatment. Toxicity was limited to grade 1-2.

1449,"The role of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer Brain is the most common site of metastatic spread in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Approximately 10% of SCLC patients have brain metastases (BM) already at diagnosis and an additional 40% will develop central nervous system (CNS) involvement during their disease course. Although whole brain radiotherapy and corticosteroids is considered the treatment of choice, accumulating evidence suggests that systemic chemotherapy may also play an important role. The concept of the brain as a pharmacologic sanctuary site for established metastases is in contrast with recent clinical observations of frequent BM responses with systemic chemotherapy. During the last decade, several reports about the effect of systemic chemotherapy on BM from SCLC have been published. Pooled data from five studies report 66% response rate (RR) in 64 patients with initial BM. In addition, an average RR of 36% is derived from five studies including 135 patients with delayed BM treated with systemic single agent chemotherapy. Among new drugs with activity in patients with SCLC brain metastases, camptothecin analog topotecan is one of the most promising with a 52% RR. Although whole brain radiation remains the standard treatment of established BM in SCLC there is an emerging role for systemic chemotherapy, particularly with the use of new active drugs as part of combined modality treatments.

Purpose/Objective(s): Lung adenocarcinomas are more commonly associated with metastatic disease to the brain as compared with other histologic types of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been demonstrated to be both predictive and prognostic for patients with lung adenocarcinoma. However, its impact on brain metastases (BM) remains inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the potential association between EGFR mutation and the risk of BM in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Furthermore we also intended to identify other risk factors for BM, which may guide the selection of management strategies. Materials/Methods: Clinical data of 234 patients at our institution from March 2007 to November 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients in this cohort had known EGFR mutation status and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relationships between EGFR mutation and BM at the initial presentation and at the last follow-up were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent factors associated with BM. Result(s): A total of 76 out of 234 patients (32.5%) had developed BM during their disease course amongst 39 patients (16.7%) had BM at their initial diagnosis. Within the entire cohort, 108 patients (46.2%) had EGFR mutations. As compared with that of wild type EGFR patients, the frequency of EGFR mutation was statistically higher for patients with BM at the initial diagnosis (64.1% vs. 35.9%, P=0.014) and at the last follow-up (63.2% vs. 36.8%, P=0.000). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of extracranial metastases regardless of EGFR mutation status either at the time of diagnosis or at the last follow-up (40.9% vs. 59.1%, P=0.313; 43.3% vs. 56.7%, P=0.494). In Multivariate Logistic regression analysis, EGFR mutation was significantly associated with the risk for BM at the initial diagnosis (OR=0.393, 95% CI=0.165-0.943, P=0.034). Among those 195 patients without BM at initial diagnosis, 1- year and 2-year accumulative rates of subsequent BM were significantly different between the patients with EGFR-mutant and EGFR-wild disease (15.0% vs. 4.2%, 37.7% vs. 18.7%; P=0.001). In Multivariate Cox regression analysis, only EGFR mutation was the independent factor for the risk of BM (HR=3.446, p=0.000). Conclusion(s): In our study, we demonstrated that BM was more common among patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, which may represent one of the distinct clinical features for EGFR-mutant tumors. EGFR mutation was the only independent predictive and prognostic risk factor for BM. The potential utility of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma should be further explored.",Excluded
1492,"Changes in the vestibular function during space flight An analysis of observations and investigations carried out in space flight has shown that some cosmonauts and astronauts have experienced vestibular disorders during the transition to weightlessness. Vestibular-sensory disorders include: Spatial illusions (the feelings of falling down, being in an upside-down position, the sensations of rotation of the craft or the body) and vertigo occurring during the onset of the orbital flight and head movements; Feelings, similar to those experienced in response to Coriolis accelerations on the Earth, which occasionally develop in weightlessness during the spacecraft rotation upon abrupt head and body movements and restrained feet; Feelings ""of the load on the vestibular analyser which is unlike any Earth-bound effects"" upon abrupt head movements during the first hours of an orbital flight and ""a prolonged movement"" during the switch-off of thrusters in weightlessness. Vestibular-vegetative disorders comprise a complex of symptoms similar to those of motion sickness: loss of appetite, stomach awareness (12%), hypersalination, nausea (9.6%) and vomiting (4.8%). Soviet studies suggest that the vestibular tolerance to the flight effects depends on the natural stability and training to the cumulative effect of adequate vestibular stimuli. This has been used in the development of the system of vestibular selection. Changes in the vestibular function seem to play the major role in the development of motion sickness in weightlessness, extra-labyrinthine factors being contributory. The current hypotheses have not yet been adequately confirmed in experiments. A detailed physiological analysis allows the conclusion that the decisive factor in the development of motion sickness may be the disturbance of the function of analysers responsible for spatial orientation which take the form of sensory conflicts as well as an altered reactivity of the organism due to the hemodynamic rearrangement.

2274,"Gene expression profiling of the anti-glioma effect of cilengitide OBJECTIVE: Malignant gliomas represent highly lethal cancers that pose great therapeutic challenges. The treatment has involved a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, yet these modalities rarely extend the life of patients to more than one year from diagnosis. Integrins are expressed in tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells. Cilengitide is the first integrin inhibitor in clinical Phase III trial for glioblastoma. However, the effects of Cilengitide on these processes have not been sufficiently examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-glioma effect of Cilengitide using DNA microarray analysis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: U87DEGFR cells (human malignant glioma cell line) were used for this experiment. The cells were harvested after 16 h of Cilengitide treatment, and mRNA was extracted. Gene expression analysis, gene ontology analysis, and pathway analysis were performed using a DNA microarray (CodeLink TM Human Whole Genome Bioarray).We validated the dysregulated genes with Q-PCR analysis and Western blotting. RESULT(S): The expression of 265 genes was changed with Cilengitide treatment. The expression of 214 genes was up-regulated by more than 4-fold and the expression of 51 genes was down-regulated by more than 4-fold compared to the controls. In gene ontology analysis, genes that were associated with ""activation of pro-apoptotic gene products"" were over-represented, and genes that were associated with ""negative regulation of neuron apoptosis"" were over-represented. In pathway analysis, ""apoptotic cleavage of cellular proteins"" and ""TNF receptor signaling pathway"" were over-represented. Apoptotic-associated genes such as caspase-8 were up-regulated. Caspase-8 mRNA and protein in U87DEGFR cells treated with Cilengitide were increased compared to control ones. CONCLUSION(S): Microarray analysis revealed the detailed mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of Cilengitide.

2173,"The alpha2-adrenergic agonist guanfacine reduces excitability of human motor cortex through disfacilitation and increase of inhibition OBJECTIVE: To test the acute effects of the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine (GFC) on motor excitability in intact humans.METHODS: Eight healthy right-handed adults received a single oral dose of 2 mg of GFC. Motor cortex excitability was tested by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand area of the left motor cortex. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. In addition, spinal and neuromuscular excitability were tested. All measures were obtained immediately before GFC intake (baseline), and 2, 6, and 24 h later.RESULTS: GFC decreased the slope of the MEP intensity curve, increased paired-pulse short-interval intracortical inhibition, and decreased paired-pulse intracortical facilitation and I-wave facilitation. These effects were maximal at 2-6 h and returned to baseline at 24 h. Motor threshold, cortical silent period, and the measures of spinal (peripheral silent period, F waves) and neuromuscular excitability (maximum M wave) remained unaffected.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the effects of an anti-noradrenergic drug on human motor cortex excitability. GFC reduced cortical excitability by disfacilitation and increased inhibition. These findings support the idea that anti-noradrenergic drugs are detrimental for cortical plasticity and learning which are down-regulated by disfacilitation or increased inhibition.",Excluded

1735,"Spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: treatment outcome and prognostic factors BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord compression (SCC) is an important complication of metastatic prostate cancer. We have analysed patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors in this patients group.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of 69 patients with spinal cord compression and prostate cancer treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital.RESULTS: At presentation 40 (58%) patients were non-ambulant and 52% were catheterised. Diagnosis was established by myelography in 42% and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 47% of patients. MRI detected significantly more patients with multiple sites of compression (51 versus 7%, P < 0.001). SCC was present at the initial diagnosis of prostatic cancer in 13 patients and 17 patients had received no hormone treatment prior to diagnosis. Following treatment 36 (52%) patients had a functional improvement of motor power with 25/40 (63%) non-ambulant patients becoming ambulant. Seventy-seven percent of patients who had eventual improvement had some improvement in power within 7 days. On multivariate analysis a single level of compression, no previous hormone therapy and a young age (<65 years) predicted for better outcome. When these factors were included an increased radiation dose (>30 Gy) or the addition of surgery did not improve the functional outcome. Following initial recovery; there was a 45% risk of developing a further episode of cord compression at the same or new site by 2 years with a median time to progression of 236 days (range 47-1215 days). The median survival was 115 days (range 5-2016 days) with 25% of patients surviving for 2 years. Patients with no prior hormone therapy had a median survival of 627 days (range 46-1516 days). Other predictors of improved survival on multivariate analysis were a single site of compression and a haemoglobin over 12 g.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SCC in prostate cancer results in improved motor function in the majority of patients. Long-term survival is possible, especially in good performance status patients with no prior hormone treatment. Survivors remain at high risk of subsequent neurological relapse. An early improvement in motor power is a strong predictor of subsequent functional improvement. MRI detects additional sites of asymptomatic SCC which makes it the investigation of choice.",Excluded
1522,"Effects of electrical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve on cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract of the rat Electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal (GP) nerve (which innervates taste buds on the caudal 1/3 of the tongue) were recorded from single cells in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation was delivered as single pulses (n=55), paired-pulses (n=15) and tetanic trains (n=11). NTS cells with GP-evoked responses were also tested for responsivity to taste stimuli (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M quinine HCl). Fifty-five neurons were studied: 49 cells showed GP-evoked (mean latency+/-SEM=18.0+/-1.32 ms); seven of these were taste-responsive. Spontaneous rate of these cells was low (mean+/-SEM=1.4+/-0.3 spikes per second; median=0.21 spikes per second) and many cells showed no spontaneous activity. Paired-pulse stimulation of the GP nerve in 13 rats produced both paired-pulse suppression (n=11) and paired-pulse enhancement (n=4); tetanic stimulation (25 Hz, 1.0 s) produced sustained (>20 s) increases or decreases in firing rate in 7 of 11 cells tested. Histological data suggested that GP-evoked responses recorded in the most rostral NTS were likely the result of polysynaptic connections. Cells with GP-evoked responses formed a heterogeneous group in terms of their response properties and differed from cells with evoked responses to chorda tympani (CT; which innervates taste buds on the rostral 1/3 of the tongue) nerve stimulation. These differences may reflect the respective functional specializations of the GP and CT nerves.",Excluded
2083,"Interfractional variation of radiation target and adaptive radiotherapy for totally resected glioblastoma This study aimed to evaluate the effects of volume adapted re-planning for radiotherapy (RT) after gross total resection (GTR) for glioblastoma. Nineteen patients with glioblastoma who underwent GTR and postoperative RT were analyzed. The volumes of the surgical cavity on computed tomography (CT) obtained one day after GTR (CT0), the first RT simulation CT (sim-CT1), and the second simulation CT for the boost RT plan (sim-CT2) were compared. The boost RT plan was based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT2 (boost RTP2) and was compared with that based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT1 (boost RTP1). The volume reduction ratios were 14.4%-51.3% (median, 29.0%) between CT0 and sim-CT1 and -7.9%-71.9% (median, 34.9%) between sim-CT1 and sim-CT2 (P < 0.001). The normal brain volumes in boost RTP1 were significantly reduced in boost RTP2, especially at high dose levels. Target volume in sim-CT2 which was not covered with the boost RTP1, developed in five cases (26.3%). The surgical cavity volume was reduced following surgery in patients with glioblastoma who underwent GTR. The application of volume-adapted re-planning during RT could decrease the irradiated volume of normal brain and prevent a target miss for boost RT. © 2013 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.",Excluded

Here, we report the successful treatment of R/R DLBCL with programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibition post-allogeneic CAR-T. Case Report: A previously healthy 26-year-old Caucasian man developed B-symptoms and cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy revealed DLBCL, activated B-cell subtype, double expressor and Ki-67 >80%. PET/CT scan revealed disease above and below the diaphragm. He achieved a partial response (PR) after R-CHOP, progressive disease (PD) after R-ICE, stable disease (SD) after R-ESHAP, and PD one month after autologous CD19-targeted CAR-T with CTL019 (CD3zeta/4-1BB). He then received R-lenalidomide (len) with radiation (24 Gy) to his mediastinal mass achieving a PR, followed by a myeloablative (Cy/TBI-12 Gy) allogeneic stem cell transplant (aSCT) from his 10/10 HLAmatched brother. He achieved 100% donor chimerism 30 days post-aSCT (D+30). Despite persistent full donor chimerism, D+60 PET/CT showed PD with confirmed relapse upon biopsy. Immunosuppression was discontinued, and ibrutinib with len was started, followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which led to a mixed response. He then continued on ibrutinib with weekly temsirolimus and received a second DLI achieving a PR, with PD shortly thereafter. He next proceeded to allogeneic CAR-T with axicabtagene-ciloleucel (CD3zeta/CD28), complicated by grade 1 cytokine release syndrome without neurotoxicity. Three weeks post-CAR-T, he developed diplopia due to a cranial nerve palsy. Brain MRI showed new pontine T2 changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for lymphoma and infection, but notable for T-cell predominance. One month postCAR-T, PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response (CMR). Repeat brain MRI was unchanged. Two months later, he developed dizziness and intractable nausea, and repeat brain MRI showed a new lesion in the inferior cerebellar vermis, with resolution of previous pontine change. Evaluation of the CSF and peripheral blood revealed no CAR T-cell persistence, and PET/CT confirmed disease relapse in the cerebellum and mediastinum. Patient then received focal radiation (24 Gy) to his cerebellar lesion along with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, after which his neurologic symptoms resolved. MRI one day after radiation showed near-complete resolution of enhancing vermis lesion. After 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, PET/CT showed a CMR, with no active disease on brain MRI. Three months into PD1-inhibition therapy, his disease remains in CMR, without GVHD nor treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion(s): This case illustrates the efficacy of allogeneic CAR-T after failure of autologous CAR-T and aSCT. Furthermore, PD1 inhibition can be used safely after allogeneic CAR-T, underscoring the need for prospective clinical studies. Copyright © 2018",Excluded
2378,"Treatment of cerebral radionecrosis by hyperbaric oxygen therapy Clinically observed adverse radiation effects (ARE) are rather uncommon, but modern imaging reveals that they are more common after radiosurgery than previously believed. Little is known about the pathogenesis, and current treatment is mostly empirical. The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) on radiation-induced bone and soft tissue necrosis is known in lesions in the maxillofacial area, the mouth and in the head and neck. HBO raises the tissue pO2 and initiates a cellular and vascular repair mechanism. This forms the basis for the hypothesis that it might also help alleviate the results of cerebral radionecrosis. This study is a preliminary attempt to test this hypothesis. Two patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were chosen for the study. They had been treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and had developed imaging signs consistent with ARE. They were treated by breathing 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (250 kPa) in sessions of 60 minutes per day. This treatment was repeated 40 times in cycles of ten sessions. Both responded well to HBO, one lesion disappeared and the other was reduced significantly in size. No adjuvant steroids were given. These results give evidence that HBO has a potential value in treating ARE but further experience will be needed to confirm its definite benefit.",Excluded

When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments.

We report the largest series of patients with histologically confirmed intracranial extravascular PEH developing in the field of previous treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We collected the clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathological findings from 4 patients in whom intracranial extravascular PEH developed after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. In all patients, the development of an enlarging hemorrhagic mass lesion at the site of previous radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging was radiographically suspicious for neoplasm and prompted biopsy or resection. All 4 patients elected to undergo biopsy or surgical resection. Histological examination of the biopsy and resection specimens in all patients demonstrated the classic features of PEH.CONCLUSION: The interval to the development of PEH ranged from 5 months to 6 years, 10 months. Clinical follow-up was available for 3 of the 4 patients. None of these 3 patients have demonstrated evidence of recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range, 15-30 months). These patients share common radiological features, potentially allowing preoperative diagnosis and improved guidance of clinical management. These cases suggest a link between radiosurgery and the development of PEH. These findings also suggest that PEH should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients treated with radiosurgery in whom a hemorrhagic mass lesion subsequently develops at or near the site of previous treatment. We think that complete surgical excision is the best treatment for intracranial PEH.",Excluded

2160,"Stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole brain radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for patients with multiple brain metastases PURPOSE: Multiple brain metastases are a common health problem, frequently diagnosed in patients with cancer. The prognosis, even after treatment with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), is poor with average expected survivals less than 6 months. Retrospective series of stereotactic radiosurgery have shown local control and survival benefits in case series of patients with solitary brain metastases. We hypothesized that radiosurgery plus WBRT would provide improved local brain tumor control over WBRT alone in patients with two to four brain metastases.METHODS: Patients with two to four brain metastases (all < or =25 mm diameter and known primary tumor type) were randomized to initial brain tumor management with WBRT alone (30 Gy in 12 fractions) or WBRT plus radiosurgery. Extent of extracranial cancer, tumor diameters on MRI scan, and functional status were recorded before and after initial care.RESULTS: The study was stopped at an interim evaluation at 60% accrual. Twenty-seven patients were randomized (14 to WBRT alone and 13 to WBRT plus radiosurgery). The groups were well matched to age, sex, tumor type, number of tumors, and extent of extracranial disease. The rate of local failure at 1 year was 100% after WBRT alone but only 8% in patients who had boost radiosurgery. The median time to local failure was 6 months after WBRT alone (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.5) in comparison to 36 months (95% CI, 15.6-57) after WBRT plus radiosurgery (p = 0.0005). The median time to any brain failure was improved in the radiosurgery group (p = 0.002). Tumor control did not depend on histology (p = 0.85), number of initial brain metastases (p = 0.25), or extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.26). Patients who received WBRT alone lived a median of 7.5 months, while those who received WBRT plus radiosurgery lived 11 months (p = 0.22). Survival did not depend on histology or number of tumors, but was related to extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.02). There was no neurologic or systemic morbidity related to stereotactic radiosurgery.CONCLUSIONS: Combined WBRT and radiosurgery for patients with two to four brain metastases significantly improves control of brain disease. WBRT alone does not provide lasting and effective care for most patients.",Excluded

Here, we show that the Ti:Sapphire laser in a multiphoton microscope can be used to cause localized damage within unlabeled cells or tissues at greater depths than previously possible. We show that the damage is due to a multiphoton process and made wounds as small as 1 microm in diameter 20 microm from the surface. A characteristic fluorescent scar allows monitoring of the damage and identifies the wound site in later observations. We were able to lesion a single axon within a bundle of nerves, locally interrupt organelle transport within one axon, cut dendrites in a zebrafish embryo, ablate a mitotic pole in a sea urchin egg, and wound the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope in starfish oocytes. The starfish nucleus collapsed approximately 1 h after wounding, indicating that loss of compartmentation barrier makes the structure unstable; surprisingly, the oocyte still completed meiotic divisions when exposed to maturation hormone, indicating that the compartmentalization and translocation of cdk1 and its regulators is not required for this process.

We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste.METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy.RESULTS: A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance.CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.",Excluded
1550,"Principles of radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis Neoplastic meningosis can be a complication of a tumor originating in the brain or the meninges, or it can be a complication of a solid tumor elsewhere that has metastasized to the leptomeninges. The therapeutic dilemma for a radiation oncologist is that neoplastic meningosis involves the entire neuraxis and, as a consequence, ideally, the entire neuraxis should be radiated. However, delivering the necessary radiation dose to the entire neuraxis may be associated with considerable neurologic or bone marrow toxicity. Radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis can be performed by external beam radiation or by intrathecal injection of radioactive nuclides or radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Intrathecal radiation has the theoretical advantage that treatment is directed towards the entire neuraxis with limited irradiation outside the neuraxis. In practice, intrathecal radiation is still under investigation and subject to some limitations and toxicities. Indications and techniques for external beam radiation may range from either therapeutic or elective cranial or craniospinal radiation to palliative involved-field radiation. Patients with neoplastic meningosis are frequently treated with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy, and/or may have been irradiated to the nervous system in the past. Both are well known risk factors for radiation damage to the nervous system. In general, current treatment protocols focus on the development of combination chemotherapy programs and reduction of the radiation dose to minimize toxicity and/or to improve tumor control.",Excluded

This study measured the changes in RNFL reflectance spectra that occurred in retinal nerve fiber bundles with different degrees of glaucomatous damage.METHODS: A rat model of glaucoma with laser photocoagulation of trabecular meshwork was used. Reflectance of the RNFL in an isolated retina was measured at wavelengths of 400-830 nm. Cytostructural distribution of the bundles measured optically was evaluated by confocal imaging of immunohistochemistry staining of cytoskeletal components, F-actin, microtubules, and neurofilaments. RNFL reflectance spectra were studied in bundles with normal-looking appearance, early F-actin distortion, and apparent damage of all cytoskeletal components. Changes of RNFL reflectance spectra were studied at different radii (0.22, 0.33, and 0.44 mm) from the optic nerve head (ONH).RESULTS: Bundles in 30 control retinas and 41 glaucomatous retinas were examined. In normal retinas, reflectance spectra were similar along the same bundles. In glaucomatous retinas, reflectance spectra changed along bundles with the spectra becoming flatter as bundle areas approached the ONH.CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) causes nonuniform changes in RNFL reflectance across wavelengths. Changes of reflectance spectra occur early in bundles near the ONH and prior to apparent cytoskeletal distortion. Using the ratio of RNFL reflectance measured at different wavelengths can provide early and sensitive detection of glaucomatous damage.",Excluded

METHODS ANDMATERIALS: We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation by in vitro clonogenic assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251, U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. RESULT(S): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect ofTMZ in U251 glioblastoma cell line which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression and in vitro. Increased radiosensitizing effects ofTMZwere associated with the induction of apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with fractionated radiation and TMZ with a trend toward improved survival rates. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections showed that Cpd188 decreased the expression of CD31 (a marker of endothelial proliferation), vascular endothelial growth factor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, suggesting that Cpd188 also has anti-angiogenic effects. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell line which was originated from a patient who had a glioblastoma and also was confirmed high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT. CONCLUSION(S): These data indicate that Cpd188 has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in human glioblastoma, especially in patients whose tumor has a high level of STAT3 expression regardless of MGMT methylation status.",Excluded
1858,"Re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of survival for patients with recurrent gliomas treated with reirradiation, and to identify subgroups for whom re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas is most beneficial. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas received re-irradiation between 1996 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 43 years (range, 20-63 years). Pathologic subtypes were glioblastomas in 21 patients (58.3%), WHO grade III astrocytomas in 8 patients (22.2%), and WHO grade I/II astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas in 7 patients (19.4%). In 27 patients, re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas was preceded by subtotal (19/36; 52.8%) or total (8/36; 22.2%) tumor resection. The median time interval between initial radiation therapy (RT) and re-irradiation was 30.5 months (range, 4-173 months). Radiation doses of the first and second radiation course were 32.4-70.0 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) and 30.0-64.6 Gy (median 45 Gy). The cumulative radiation doses were 82.8-123.0 Gy (median 100.2 Gy), and the median cumulative biological equivalent doses (BED) were 195.8 (a/b = 2 Gy) and 102.3 Gy (a/b = 10 Gy). All patients were followed-up until death or the time of analysis. Result(s): Thirty-two patients died of disease 2-50 months after re-irradiation and one patient was alive with disease 12 months after re-irradiation. Three patients are alive without disease 8-50 months after re-irradiation. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months (range, 2-50 months), and the 6 and 12months OS rates were 83.3 and 39.4%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months, and 6-months and 12-months PFS rates were 71.09 and 41.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <=70 (p<0.001), the dose of re-irradiation <=40 Gy(p = 0.019), and the length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation(p = 0.029) were associated with improvement in OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p=0.033) was the most important predictors for OS. Histologic subtype (GBM vs non-GBM, median OS, 8 vs 12 months, p=0.668) and surgical resection (median OS, 9 vs 12 months, p = 0.810) had no significant benefit on OS. Radiographically suspected radiation necrosis (RN) after re-irradiation was seen in 6 patients (16.7%) whose median cumulative radiation doses were 100.4 Gy, and a median cumulative BED were 198.4 Gy (a/b=2 Gy). At 3, 7 and 8 months after re-irradiation, neurological deterioration occurred in 3 patients, and was managed with dexamethasone and anticonvulsant drug. Conclusion(s): Approximately 45 Gy of re-irradiation after 60 Gy of initial radiation therapy was feasible without serious complications. Re-irradiation could be suggested as an alternative salvage treatment for selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and recurrence over a longer period of time.",Excluded
1884,"Late effects of intracranial radiation induces resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy that is partially reversible with CSF-1R inhibition Primary and metastatic CNS malignancies remain incurable despite aggressive therapy with surgery and radiation. Immunotherapy has shown promise in many solid and hematologic malignancies, however, results have been disappointing in recurrent primary CNS tumors. Additionally, while upfront immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) has shown equal efficacy intracranially and extracranially, these responses are abrogated in previously irradiated brain lesions. Together, we hypothesize that radiation modulates the brain microenvironment to permit tumor growth and suppress anti-tumor immunity. As such, we developed a mouse model whereby orthotopic transplantation of murine gliomas into previously irradiated normal brain results in a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, the ICB-sensitive glioma cell line, GL261, is resistant to ICB therapy when implanted into a previously irradiated brain microenvironment. Immunophenotyping revealed a decreased ratio of CD8:CD4 T cells within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from previously irradiated mice though the relative frequency of neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells was slightly increased and no difference in PD-1 expression was observed. Alternatively, the frequency of microglia and tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was increased following irradiation suggesting a potential role for these myeloid cells in the immunosuppressive effects noted. Consistently, the administration of a CSF-1R inhibitor, which has been shown to reduce the number of microglia and block MDSCs, partially resensitizes GL261 cells to ICB therapy. In summary, we have developed a model that recapitulates the late effects of radiation on immunotherapy-resistance in CNS tumors. Preliminary results suggest that these late radiation effects are mediated through an increased myeloid population, and that inhibition of these cell subsets via the CSF-1R pathway can partially restore efficacy of ICB therapy. Furthermore, this model may provide further insight into additional therapeutic strategies that can be used to overcome these mechanisms of resistance induced by radiation therapy in the CNS.",Excluded
1782,"Novel strategy with the automatic non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy for angiosarcoma of the scalp BACKGROUND: Total scalp irradiation presents technical and dosimetric challenges. While reports suggest that HyperArc, a new stereotactic radiosurgery planning technique applied to non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique, is associated with high conformity and rapid dose fall-off, the performance of HyperArc for total scalp irradiation has not been explored. The current study aimed to compare the dosimetric performance of HyperArc plans with those of non-coplanar VMAT plans in angiosarcoma of the scalp.METHODS: Ten patients with angiosarcoma of the scalp were included in this study. The performance of three different plans administered using TrueBeam Edge were compared: non-coplanar VMAT using flattening filter (FF) beams (VMAT-FF), HyperArc using FF beams (HyperArc-FF), and HyperArc using flattening filter free (FFF) beams (HyperArc-FFF). The dose distribution, dosimetric parameters, and dosimetric accuracy for each of these plans were evaluated.RESULTS: The three plans showed no statistically significant differences in target volume coverage, conformity, and homogeneity. The HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans provided significantly lower mean brain doses (12.63 +/- 3.31 Gy and 12.71 +/- 3.40 Gy) than did the VMAT-FF plans (17.11 +/- 5.25 Gy). There were almost no differences in sparing the organs at risk between the HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans. The HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans provided a shorter beam-on time than did the VMAT-FF plan. The 3%/2 mm gamma test pass rates were above 95% for all three plans.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the HyperArc plan can be potentially used for radiation therapy of target regions with large and complicated shapes, such as the scalp, and that there are no advantages of using FFF beams.",Excluded
1705,"Interference between active implanted medical devices and electromagnetic field emitting devices is rare but real: Results of an incidence study in a population of physicians in France Background and Objective Assessing the behavior of active implanted medical devices (AIMDs) in response to electromagnetic field (EMF) transmitters is a current issue of great importance. Given the numerous telecommunication systems and our lack of knowledge as to the impact of electromagnetic effects, this study investigated the reality of possible AIMD disturbance by EMFs by interviewing health professionals. Method A self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to almost 5,000 physicians in five specialties: cardiology; endocrinology; ears, nose, and throat; urology; and neurology. It collected data on the existence and annual number of incidents observed and the conditions under which they occurred, the EMF sources involved, and the means of managing the malfunctions. Results A total of 1,188 physicians agreed to participate. Sixteen percent of participants reported cases of implant failure, three-quarters of whom, mainly in cardiology, reported rates of at least one incident per year - amounting to more than 100 incidents per year in all. Severity appeared to be moderate (discomfort or transient symptoms), but frequently required resetting or, more rarely, replacing the device. Some serious incidents were, however, reported. The sources implicated were basically of two types: electronic security systems (antitheft and airport gates) and medical electromagnetic radiation devices. These incidents were poorly reported within the public health system, preventing follow-up and effective performance of alert and surveillance functions. Conclusion Although minor, the risk of interference between EMF sources and AIMDs is real and calls for vigilance. It particularly concerns antitheft and airport security gates, though other sources may also cause incidents. ©2013, The Authors. Journal compilation ©2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1582,"Classifying the risk of ionizing radiation exposure after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Learning Objectives: We hypothesized that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) could be classified by their risk of receiving potentially harmful ionizing radiation exposure (PHIRE) from diagnostic tests and medical procedures. Method(s): The EMR of all patients admitted to our institution with aSAH from 01/2012-12/2015 were retrospectively evaluated using an IRB-approved protocol for patient-specific and disease-specific data. Patients were excluded if they died prior to discharge. Total effective dose of ionizing radiation (TEDIR) was calculated from published data. PHIRE was considered to have occurred in patients with TEDIR> 50 mSV, the annual radiation exposure limit for radiation workers. A multivariate classification tree was created to predict PHIRE risk groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk of PHIRE between the risk groups. Result(s): Data were collected from 108 aSAH patients. The mean TEDIR was 47.8 mSv. After development of the multivariate classification tree, the tree was pruned to include only ventriculostomy (EVD), Hunt/Hess score (HH), and aneurysm location, according to normal statistical conventions. Patients who did not have an ventriculostomy (EVD) were at low risk for PHIRE (N = 2/35, (5.7%)). Patients with an EVD + HH 2 + anterior circulation aneurysms were at moderate risk for PHIRE (N = 17/42, 40.5%). (OR = 11.2, p = 0.002). Patients with an EVD + HH < 2 or EVD + HH 2 + posterior circulation aneurysms were at high risk for PHIRE (N = 23/31, 74.2%) (OR = 47.4, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this study, aSAH patients were categorized into low, moderate and high risk groups of PHIRE according to three factors: EVD, HH, and aneurysm location. These groups likely represent differential baseline neurologic status and risk of neurologic complications. Alternative diagnostic or therapeutic modalities should be utilized, when possible, for patients in the high-risk group and should be considered for patients in the moderate-risk group. Future research should validate these risk groups in larger patient samples and across multiple medical centers.",Excluded

Inclusion criteria were (1) significant cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficit, (2) no evidence of vessel occlusion on spCTA and (3) follow-up-confirmed acute ischemic infarction. waveletCTA was independently analysed by two readers regarding presence and location of vessel occlusions. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of waveletCTA-detected occlusions.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, an occlusion was identified using waveletCTA in 31 (52.5 %) patients with negative spCTA. Out of 47 patients with middle cerebral artery infarction, 27 occlusions (57.4 %) were detected by waveletCTA, mainly located in the M2 (15) and M3 segments (8). The presence of waveletCTA-detected occlusions was associated with larger CBF deficit volumes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.335, p = 0.010) and shorter times from symptom onset (OR = 0.306, p = 0.041).CONCLUSIONS: waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in about half of acute ischemic stroke patients and may potentially identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy.KEY POINTS: * waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in stroke patients. * waveletCTA-detected occlusions are associated with larger cerebral blood flow deficits. * waveletCTA has the potential to identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy. * waveletCTA implies neither additional radiation exposure nor extra contrast agent.",Excluded
1389,"In vivo BDNF modulation of adult functional and morphological synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibers Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed as a key regulator and mediator of long-term synaptic modifications related to learning and memory maintenance. Our previous studies show that application of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) sufficient to elicit LTP at the dentate gyrus (DG)-CA3 pathway produces mossy fiber structural modifications 7 days after tetanic stimulation. In the present study, we show that acute intrahippocampal microinfusion of BDNF induces a lasting potentiation of synaptic efficacy in the DG-CA3 projection of anesthetized adult rats. Furthermore, we show that BDNF functional modifications in synaptic efficacy are accompanied by a presynaptic structural long-lasting reorganization at the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway. These findings support the idea that BDNF plays an important role as synaptic messenger of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult mammalian brain, in vivo.",Excluded
1460,"Dosimetric consequences of translational and rotational errors in frame-less image-guided radiosurgery BACKGROUND: To investigate geometric and dosimetric accuracy of frame-less image-guided radiosurgery (IG-RS) for brain metastases.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Single fraction IG-RS was practiced in 72 patients with 98 brain metastases. Patient positioning and immobilization used either double- (n = 71) or single-layer (n = 27) thermoplastic masks. Pre-treatment set-up errors (n = 98) were evaluated with cone-beam CT (CBCT) based image-guidance (IG) and were corrected in six degrees of freedom without an action level. CBCT imaging after treatment measured intra-fractional errors (n = 64). Pre- and post-treatment errors were simulated in the treatment planning system and target coverage and dose conformity were evaluated. Three scenarios of 0 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm GTV-to-PTV (gross tumor volume, planning target volume) safety margins (SM) were simulated.RESULTS: Errors prior to IG were 3.9 mm +/- 1.7 mm (3D vector) and the maximum rotational error was 1.7degree +/- 0.8degree on average. The post-treatment 3D error was 0.9 mm +/- 0.6 mm. No differences between double- and single-layer masks were observed. Intra-fractional errors were significantly correlated with the total treatment time with 0.7 mm +/- 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm +/- 0.7 mm for treatment times <=23 minutes and >23 minutes (p<0.01), respectively. Simulation of RS without image-guidance reduced target coverage and conformity to 75% +/- 19% and 60% +/- 25% of planned values. Each 3D set-up error of 1 mm decreased target coverage and dose conformity by 6% and 10% on average, respectively, with a large inter-patient variability. Pre-treatment correction of translations only but not rotations did not affect target coverage and conformity. Post-treatment errors reduced target coverage by >5% in 14% of the patients. A 1 mm safety margin fully compensated intra-fractional patient motion.CONCLUSIONS: IG-RS with online correction of translational errors achieves high geometric and dosimetric accuracy. Intra-fractional errors decrease target coverage and conformity unless compensated with appropriate safety margins.",Excluded

1562,"Epworth Sleepiness Scale-a novel tool to assess somnolence syndrome post radiotherapy to brain Introduction: Radiation to brain causes early, early-delayed and delayed side effects.1 Although early and delayed effects are well studied, there is paucity of literature regarding early-delayed effects like somnolence syndrome. The existing studies use general symptom assessment and visual analog scales.2 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a time tested tool to assess daytime sleepiness in various conditions.3 This study is an attempt to determine the presence of somnolence in our patients using this novel scale. It is a simple questionnaire and we expect this will be able to grade the severity of somnolence. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine post radiation somnolence using Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective(s): To study the incidence of somnolence syndrome in patients receiving radiotherapy to brain. Material(s) and Method(s): 23 patients with primary brain tumor or metastases to brain were the subjects of the study. Patient demographics and tumor type- primary or metastatic along with grade was noted. Patients with Karnofsky performance status less than 70 and those with pre-existing sleep disorders were excluded from the study. Patients were treated with palliative whole brain radiation for brain metastases and conformal adjuvant radiotherapy for primary brain tumors as per standard guidelines. Patients were subjected to Epworth Sleepiness Scale3 at baseline, thereafter every week during radiation; also continuing weekly after cessation of radiation until 6 weeks post treatment. Result(s): All 23 patients (median age 50 years) completed the planned questionnaires until 6 weeks post radiation. 20 had primary brain tumors whereas 3 had metastatic lesions in brain. Of the 23 patients, 14 patients (60.86%) had abnormal or increased daytime sleepiness; of which 3 had ESS scores greater than 16. Conclusion(s): Somnolence occurred in 60.86% of the patients who underwent radiation treatment for brain tumors, which is in accordance with existing literature.4,5 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an effective tool to detect and quantify somnolence, however it does not consider other symptoms of somnolence syndrome and hence should be combined with visual analog scale to get complete information.",Excluded
2042,"The Role of Advanced Imaging in Assessing Response to Definitive Chemoradiation Before Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer We examined the responses to chemoradiation according to imaging modality in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Provided patients achieved at least a partial response, advanced imaging response neither affected survival nor added information to the decision to offer prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), suggesting that limited-stage SCLC patients with partial response using any imaging modality should not be denied PCI. Introduction: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) improves survival for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Evidence for PCI in limited-stage SCLC largely derives from studies requiring only chest x-ray (CXR) to determine remission status. We analyzed thoracic chemoradiation therapy (TCRT) outcomes according to imaging modality to determine which patients benefitted most from PCI. Patients and Methods: All limited-stage SCLC patients who received TCRT as well as PCI at our institution were reviewed. Imaging between TCRT end and PCI start was characterized as complete (CR), partial (PR), or other response. Result(s): Thirty-eight consecutive patients were assessed for TCRT response before PCI with CXR (n = 21), chest computed tomography (CT; n = 27), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 11). CR was identified on 71% of CXRs, 41% of CT scans, and 18% of PET/CT scans. Median survival was 28.3 months for the entire cohort and did not differ for patients who had CXR alone versus CT and/or PET/CT for restaging (P =.78) or those with PR using any modality versus CR using all modalities (22.6 months vs. 45.5 months; P =.22). CT CR patients had numerical but not statistically significant improved 2-year (P =.18) and 3-year (P =.13) survival compared with CT PR. Conclusion(s): CXR remains an appropriate modality to assess TCRT response before PCI in limited-stage SCLC. Advanced imaging did not inform the decision to offer PCI in this study. Because of similar excellent survival profiles independent of imaging modality and TCRT response, this analysis suggests limited-stage SCLC patients with PR using any modality should not be denied PCI, akin to standards for extensive-stage SCLC.

1423,"Detecting intrinsic scattering changes correlated to neuron action potentials using optical coherence imaging We demonstrate how optical coherence imaging techniques can detect intrinsic scattering changes that occur during action potentials in single neurons. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), an increase in scattering intensity from neurons in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica is observed following electrical stimulation of the connective nerve. In addition, optical coherence microscopy (OCM), with its superior transverse spatial resolution, is used to demonstrate a direct correlation between scattering intensity changes and membrane voltage in single cultured Aplysia bag cell neurons during evoked action potentials. While intrinsic scattering changes are small, OCT and OCM have potential use as tools in neuroscience research for non-invasive and non-contact measurement of neural activity without electrodes or fluorescent dyes.

Materials/Methods: Sixteen patients completed hepatectomy and SRT for either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (6) or metastases from colorectal (5), neuroendocrine (2), uterine (2), or sarcoma (1) primary. Twenty-one operable metastases were resected in 5 patients and gold fiducials were placed into the unresectable lesions to facilitate definitive SRT. Three patients with initially unresectable tumors received preoperative SRT followed by R0 resection. SRT as a bridge to liver transplant was used in 4 patients with HCC. Four patients had salvage SRT for recurrence after surgery. All patients completed 4D-CT and 3DSPECT/ CT to define functional normal liver volume (NLV) for SRT planning. MV-fluoro was performed to confirm tumor/fiducial respiratory motion within the PTV. In retrospect, our patient's treatment planning, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were reviewed under an IRB approved outcomes study. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE v3.0. Result(s): All patients successfully completed a combination of hepatectomy and SRT. Forty lesions were treated with hepatectomy and 20 (<= 3 per patient) received SRT with a mean PTV of 132.6 cc (range, - 9.7- 803.5). The mean dose was 47.7 Gy (range, - 36-60) prescribed to the PTV in 5-16 fractions. With median follow-up of 17.7 months (range, - 5.8-32.1), 2 patients had grade 3 elevation of Total Bilirubin prior to initiation of SRT which persisted through treatment. No incidence of > grade 1 radiation-induced liver disease was observed. The most common clinical toxicity was Grade <= 2 fatigue. No patients had grade > 2 clinical toxicity. As a group, functional NLVs defined on 3D-SPECT/CT were significantly reduced compared to liver volumes defined on CT and estimated from the Body Surface Area equation (p = 0.037 and p = 0.0012 respectively). Postoperative morbidity was <= Grade 1. On followup imaging, no in-field failures have occurred. A total of 18.7% of the patients have had a failure elsewhere in the liver. Overall survival was 75% with 4 deaths, 2 of which were from liver failure and 2 from progressive systemic disease. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary study indicates that combination of liver SRT with hepatic resection is safe and effective. It can be used preoperatively to increase resectability or postoperatively to salvage surgical failures. It can also be used to target unresectable metastases in combination with limited hepatectomies for resectable peripheral lesions thereby expanding indications for curative treatment. SRT planning with 3D-SPECT/CT allows identification and preservation of the functional NLV.",Excluded

However cases of radiosensitization following conventional radiation therapy in BRAF-I treated patients have raised serious concerns about the real feasibility and risk/benefit ratio of this combination. Method(s): Blind review by 2 independent observers of brain MRI follow-up pictures and survival assessment in all patients who had been treated by GKRS and BRAF-I at a single institution. Result(s): Among53 GKRS performed in 30 patients who ever received BRAF-I and GKRS, 33 GKRS were performed in 24 patients while under BRAF-I treatment, from which only 4 with an interruption of BRAF-I. The 20 other GKRS were performed in 15 patients (including 9 of the 24) before initiation of BRAF-I treatment. Out of the 263 BM treated, only 3 edemas and 3 hemorrhages were detected within 2 months after GKRS and 4 edemas and 7 hemorrhages were detected later. No case of BM radiation necrosis and no scalp radiation dermatitis occurred. Neither the MRI features nor the incidence of the rare adverse events were deemed unexpected in such a population of melanoma BM. Median survival from first GKRS and first dose of BRAF-I was 24.7, and 48.8 weeks, respectively. Conclusion(s): This series does not show immediate radiotoxicity nor radiation-recall, in melanoma patients with BRAF-I whose BM are treated by GKRS.

1526,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide controls the suprachiasmatic circadian clock network via ERK1/2 and DUSP4 signalling The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) co-ordinates circadian behaviour and physiology in mammals. Its cell-autonomous circadian oscillations pivot around a well characterised transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL), whilst the SCN circuit as a whole is synchronised to solar time by its retinorecipient cells that express and release vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The cell-autonomous and circuit-level mechanisms whereby VIP synchronises the SCN are poorly understood. We show that SCN slices in organotypic culture demonstrate rapid and sustained circuit-level circadian responses to VIP that are mediated at a cell-autonomous level. This is accompanied by changes across a broad transcriptional network and by significant VIP-directed plasticity in the internal phasing of the cell-autonomous TTFL. Signalling via ERK1/2 and tuning by its negative regulator DUSP4 are critical elements of the VIP-directed circadian re-programming. In summary, we provide detailed mechanistic insight into VIP signal transduction in the SCN at the level of genes, cells and neural circuit.",Excluded
1653,"Enhancement of ERK phosphorylation and photic responses in Vc/C1 neurons of a migraine model Although it is well known that migraine pain is enhanced by photic stimulation of the eye, the mechanisms underlying this response are not yet understood. Noxious stimulation to the dura is known to activate trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis and upper cervical spinal cord (Vc/C1) neurons, causing migraine pain. Intense photic stimulation to the eye is also known to activate certain Vc/C1 neurons, thus increasing migraine pain. In this study, we hypothesized that Vc/C1 neurons receiving noxious dural input would be further activated by intense photic stimulation, resulting in the enhancement of migraine pain. However, mechanisms underlying the interactions between dural and photic sensory information in Vc/C1 neurons is unknown. To evaluate the above hypothesis, we studied phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) -immunoreactive (IR) cells in Vc/C1 in dural mustard oil (DMO)-administrated rats. The change in neuronal excitability of Vc/C1 nociceptive neurons receiving input from the dura in DMO rats was examined and tested if those neurons were modulated by intense flush light stimulation. There were many pERK-IR cells in the lateral portion of Vc/C1 after MO administration to the dura. Flashlight presentation to the eye in DMO rats caused an enhancement of ERK phosphorylation in Vc/C1 neurons and pERK-IR cells were significantly suppressed after intracisternal administration of MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Dura-light sensitive (DL) neurons were recorded in the lateral portion of Vc/C1 and photic responses of DL neurons were significantly enhanced following dural MO administration. These findings indicate that DL Vc/C1 neurons in DMO rats intensified their responses to intense photic stimulation and that ERK phosphorylation in Vc/C1 neurons receiving noxious dural input increased with intense photic stimulation, suggesting that Vc/C1 nociceptive neurons are involved in the enhancement of dural nociception associated with intense light stimulation.",Excluded

1477,"H2O2-Sensitive Isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 Act in Bitter-Sensing Gustatory Neurons to Promote Avoidance of UV During Egg-Laying The evolutionarily conserved TRPA1 channel can sense various stimuli including temperatures and chemical irritants. Recent results have suggested that specific isoforms of Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) are UV-sensitive and that their UV sensitivity is due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. However, whether such UV sensitivity served any physiological purposes in animal behavior was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms promote avoidance of UV when adult Drosophila females are selecting sites for egg-laying. First, we show that blind/visionless females are still capable of sensing and avoiding UV during egg-laying when intensity of UV is high yet within the range of natural sunlight. Second, we show that such vision-independent UV avoidance is mediated by a group of bitter-sensing neurons on the proboscis that express H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms. We show that these bitter-sensing neurons exhibit dTRPA1-dependent UV sensitivity. Importantly, inhibiting activities of these bitter-sensing neurons, reducing their dTRPA1 expression, or reducing their H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity all significantly reduced blind females' UV avoidance, whereas selectively restoring a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive isoform of dTRPA1 in these neurons restored UV avoidance. Lastly, we show that specifically expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in these bitter-sensing neurons promotes egg-laying avoidance of red light, an otherwise neutral cue for egg-laying females. Together, these results demonstrate a physiological role of the UV-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms, reveal that adult Drosophila possess at least two sensory systems for detecting UV, and uncover an unexpected role of bitter-sensing taste neurons in UV sensing.",Excluded
1315,"Limitations of analytical dose calculations for small field proton radiosurgery The purpose of the work was to evaluate the dosimetric uncertainties of an analytical dose calculation engine and the impact on treatment plans using small fields in intracranial proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) for a gantry based double scattering system. 50 patients were evaluated including 10 patients for each of 5 diagnostic indications of: arteriovenous malformation (AVM), acoustic neuroma (AN), meningioma (MGM), metastasis (METS), and pituitary adenoma (PIT). Treatment plans followed standard prescription and optimization procedures for PSRS. We performed comparisons between delivered dose distributions, determined by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and those calculated with the analytical dose calculation algorithm (ADC) used in our current treatment planning system in terms of dose volume histogram parameters and beam range distributions. Results show that the difference in the dose to 95% of the target (D95) is within 6% when applying measured field size output corrections for AN, MGM, and PIT. However, for AVM and METS, the differences can be as great as 10% and 12%, respectively. Normalizing the MC dose to the ADC dose based on the dose of voxels in a central area of the target reduces the difference of the D95 to within 6% for all sites. The generally applied margin to cover uncertainties in range (3.5% of the prescribed range + 1 mm) is not sufficient to cover the range uncertainty for ADC in all cases, especially for patients with high tissue heterogeneity. The root mean square of the R90 difference, the difference in the position of distal falloff to 90% of the prescribed dose, is affected by several factors, especially the patient geometry heterogeneity, modulation and field diameter. In conclusion, implementation of Monte Carlo dose calculation techniques into the clinic can reduce the uncertainty of the target dose for proton stereotactic radiosurgery. If MC is not available for treatment planning, using MC dose distributions to adjust the delivered doses level can also reduce uncertainties below 3% for mean target dose and 6% for the D95.",Excluded

At 2 months post-irradiation, cellular markers of inflammation (total, activated, and newborn microglia) and neurogenesis (newborn neurons) were measured in 40 mum sections of the dentate gyrus (DG).RESULTS: Although the total number of microglia in the DG/hilus was not significantly different (p > 0.7) in unirradiated, single dose, and fWBI rats, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.003) increase in the percent-activated microglia; fWBI did not (p > 0.1). Additionally, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.002) dose-dependent increase in surviving newborn microglia; fWBI did not (p < 0.8). Although total proliferation in the DG was reduced equally by single and fWBI doses, single doses produced a significant dose-dependent (p < 0.02) decrease in surviving newborn neurons; fWBI did not (p > 0.6).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the rat brain's cellular response to single doses often does not predict its cellular response to 'biologically equivalent' fWBI doses.",Included

Tests of sensitivity of these double mutants to UV and to chemical mutagens revealed that mus-26 and upr-1 belong to the same epistatic group. The UV dose-response curve of mus-26 showed a characteristic plateau in the range of 100-200 J/m2. The same characteristic was also shown in the dose-response curves of upr-1 and the double mutant, upr-1 mus-26. Photoreactivation of UV damage in mus-26, upr-1 and upr-1 mus-26 was defective but not null. Assays were made of the reversion rate of ad-8 in strains that also carried UV-sensitive mutations. The reversion frequencies of the strains with upr-1 and upr-1 mus-26 were very low for the UV dose range below 300 J/m2, similarly to mus-26. Previously reported homozygous sterility of mus-26 was not caused by the mus-26 locus itself, and fertile strains were obtained among progeny.

In both cases difficulties exist in treating large volumes near organs at risk (OAR) with high dose levels. Particularly, more difficulties can occur in cases of re-irradiation. HT allows this kind of treatment by using of IMRT technique with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) associated with daily IGRT. Materials and Methods/Patients and Methods: Between October 2010 and April 2011 thirteen patients (9 male and 4 female) with advanced or recurrence head and neck cancer were enrolled in our study; in particular: 3 primary cutaneous advanced carcinoma (involving orbital and/or paranasal cavities), 4 recurrences after previous radiotherapy in the same site, 7 advanced head and neck cancer. The mean age was 63.2 years. Six patients received concomitant chemotherapy platinum-based. All patients underwent fiber-optic endoscopy, CT imaging and MRI imaging for staging. All patients also underwent 18-FDG-PET-CT virtual-simulation for treatment planning. All patients received a supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol. The treatment volumes were: the gross tumor volume and positive nodes (as visible at imaging) irradiated with curative doses (66-70.5 Gy in 30 fractions, 2.2-2.35 Gy/die); nodal levels at higher risk irradiated with prophylactic doses (60 Gy/30 fractions); loco-regional nodes irradiated with prophylactic doses (54 Gy/30 fractions). The countered organ at risk were: brain, brainstem, chiasm, optic nerve, lens, spinal cord, parotid glands, mandible, temporal-mandibular joint. In patients previously irradiated the prior treatment planning was reviewed in order to evaluate the overlapping of the irradiated volumes. Results were evaluated in terms of acute and sub-acute toxicity and clinical outcome. Toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG-EORTC scale. Fiber-optic endoscopy was performed 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. CT, MRI and PET-CT imaging were performed 3 months after treatment. Result(s): All patients completed the treatment. One patient required interruption of treatment for 2 days. Five patients required infusion medical therapy, during radiotherapy, with corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-fungal, analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs and parenteral nutrition. Acute skin toxicity was: G1 in 9 patients, G2 in 2 patients, G3 in 1 patient. Acute mucous toxicity was: G1 in 8 patients, G2 in 4 patients, G3 in 1 patient. For three patients re-planning during radiation treatment was necessary because of relevant tumor volume reduction. Three patients have a complete clinical response during treatment, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Five patients have a partial clinical response > 50% at the end of RT, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Two patients have a partial clinical response < 50%, and 2 patients a stable disease after RT, confirmed at posttreatment imaging. The last patient had no sufficient follow-up to evaluate response. Late toxicity was not evaluated because of the short follow-up. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our initial experience shows that HT allows delivering of high radiation doses to the tumor volume with good precision resulting from to the ability to verify daily set-up patients by megavoltage cone beam CT. Dose escalation results in objective clinical responses already during radiation treatment with possibility of re-planning, allowing for adaptive radiotherapy. Relevant toxicity, particularly in patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy, requires close monitoring of patients and supportive care to allow completing treatment. Our supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol is useful in this regard. Our results are absolutely preliminary, PET-CT is mandatory for contouring before the treatment and during radiotherapy for re-planning and also at the of radiotherapy for quantitative response evaluation. Further follow up is necessary to evaluate long term outcome and late toxicity.",Excluded

Optimal management of recurrent CNSL is poorly defined. Objective We aim to determine the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of recurrent CNSL. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent intracranial CNSL between 1999 and 2011. Results Fourteen patients (20 tumors) underwent SRS. The median patient age was 71 years (range, 18-82 years). Seven patients (50%) had primary CNSL. All had received prior chemotherapy, and nine patients (64%) had undergone prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with a median dose of 40 Gy in 25 fractions. The median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score was 80. The median tumor volume was 6.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 0.5-37.7); the median margin dose was 15.5 Gy (range, 10-18). Eleven patients (79%) had tumor regression (n = 11) shown on MRI after SRS. The median overall survival after SRS was 9.5 months. No patient had a major radiation-related complication. Conclusion Stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with recurrent CNSL is well tolerated and has a high rate of radiographic response. A marginal dose of 15.5 Gy or greater, a Karnofsky score of 80 or greater, and the absence of pre-SRS WBRT were associated with significantly longer overall survival. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be beneficial as an initial salvage therapy in the treatment of recurrent CNSL for properly selected patients. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1326,"Influence of rotational setup errors on dose in target and organs at risk in cranial radiotherapy Purpose or Objective: The aim of this study is to detect dose aberrations in cranial radiation therapy in the target volume and adjacent organs at risk (OARs) caused by insufficient rotational setup correction. 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) fusions were considered as the gold standard and compared to 4 DOF and 3 DOF registrations. Material(s) and Method(s): Setup errors of 12 patients with cranial lesions undergoing radiotherapy and positioned with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were analyzed. The PTVs of the included patients were large and irregularly shaped and located near or overlapping cranial OARs such as brainstem, chiasm, optical nerves or lenses. A registration between planning CT and the first CBCT of the treatment course was performed using 6 DOF, 4 DOF and 3 DOF. Differences between the three registrations were implemented and the planning CT and associated structure set shifted and warped accordingly. To detect the DOF with the largest influence on the delivered dose a rotational error of 2degree, 3degree and 4degree was simulated in one rotational dimension at a time. Using the original parameters, the treatment plan was copied and recalculated to the warped image set. Dmax and Dmean of the cranial OARs and D98 and D2 for the respective CTV and PTV were analyzed. Result(s): Differences between 6 DOF and 4 or 3 DOF fusion ranged between -1.4degree and 2degree in pitch direction, -2.5degree to 2degree in yaw, and -4.4degree to 4.2degree in roll direction. Resulting median D98 in the PTV decreased by 0.7 Gy using only 3 DOF and increased by 0.08 Gy if 4 DOF were included. Maximum dose reduction of the PTV D98 was 2.96 Gy using 3 DOF and 0.39 Gy using 4 DOF. CTV dose decreased by 0.68 using only 3 DOF and by 0.03 Gy using 4 DOF. Resulting median dose effects in the OARs are displayed in Figure 1, with largest effects of additional 0.2 and 0.8 Gy for the left and right lenses, respectively. Doses for individual patients varied up to additional 6 Gy in the lenses and 3 Gy in the optic nerves. Effects on doses in the OARs and target volumes were generally larger with 3 DOF than with 4 DOF included, except for the brainstem with no visible difference. Pitch and roll setup errors had larger effects on the OARs compared to yaw setup deviations, as demonstrated in Figure 2. 2degree roll setup errors caused more than 5 Gy dose effect on the ipsilateral optical nerve and chiasm, followed by 2degree pitch errors resulting in over 3 Gy additional dose. The simulated 2degree yaw error had an effect of under 1 Gy on dose delivery. [Figure Presented] [Figure Presented] Conclusion(s): For cases involving higher dose effects on the evaluated structures, 4DOF registration improved plan conformity compared to 3DOF. Clinically relevant dose deviations in the CTV were not found in this patient collective. While mean dose delivery to OARs increased only slightly, up to 6 Gy in additional dose occurred for individual patient cases in this collective because of rotational errors. Safety margins for OARs could be a solution to this matter. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

2357,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for metastatic melanoma: An analysis of survival, outcome, and complications OBJECTIVE: Although the mainstays for treatment of metastatic brain disease have been surgery and/or external beam radiation therapy, an increasing number of patients are being referred for stereotactic radiosurgery as the primary intervention for their intracranial pathological abnormalities. The lack of efficacy and cognitive and behavioral consequences of whole brain irradiation have prompted clinicians to select patients for alternative therapies. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Leksell gamma unit therapy for metastatic melanoma to the brain. METHOD(S): We present our experience with 59 Leksell gamma unit treatment sessions in 45 consecutive patients who presented with metastatic melanoma to the brain. Five of these procedures were performed as salvage therapy for patients who needed second radiosurgical treatment for new lesions that were remote from the previous targets and were not included in the overall analyses. RESULT(S): The population included 78% male patients. The mean patient age was 53 years (age range, 24-80 yr). The mean time from diagnosis of primary melanoma to discovery of brain metastasis was 43 months (median, 27.5 mo; range, 1-180 mo). At the time of diagnosis of brain disease, 35.5% of the patients (16 of 45 patients) had neurological symptoms, 77.7% (35 of 45 patients) had known visceral metastases, and 11.1% (5 of 45 patients) had seizure disorders. Eighty-six percent of the lesions (80 of 93 lesions) were cortical, 12% (11 of 93 lesions) were cerebellar, 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were pontine, and 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were thalamic. Fifty-seven percent of the sessions (31 of 54 sessions) were performed for a single lesion, 24.1% (13 of 54 sessions) for two lesions, 9.2% (5 of 54 sessions) for three lesions, 7.4% (4 of 54 sessions) for four lesions, and 1.8% (1 of 54 sessions) for five lesions. The mean treatment volume was 5.6 cc, with a mean prescription of 21.6 Gy to the 56.0% mean isodose line. The median survival time of the patients in our population, using Kaplan-Meier curves, was 43 months from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma (range, 3-180 mo) and 8 months (range, 1-20 mo) from the time of gamma knife treatment. Complications included seizures within 24 hours of the procedure in four patients, with transient nausea and vomiting in three patients, transient worsening of preprocedure paresis responsive to steroids in three patients, and increased confusion in one patient. All 45 patients were located for follow-up (mean follow-up duration, 1 yr). After gamma knife treatment, 78% of the patients (35 of 45 patients) experienced either improved or stable neurological symptomatology before death or at the time of the latest follow-up examination. There were 26 deaths (58%). The cause of death was determined to be neurological in only 2 of 45 patients (7.7%). Follow-up magnetic resonance images revealed a 97% local tumor control rate of gamma knife-treated lesions, with 28% radiographic disappearance (9 of 32 cases). Six patients developed new lesions remote from radiosurgical targets and underwent second procedures. CONCLUSION(S): Although metastatic melanoma to the brain continues to have a foreboding prognosis for long-term survival, gamma knife radiosurgery seems to be a relatively safe, noninvasive, palliative therapy, halting or reversing neurological progression in 77.8% of treated patients (35 of 45 patients). The survival rate matches or exceeds those previously reported for surgery and other forms of radiotherapy. Only 7.7% of the patients in our study population who died as a result of metastatic melanoma (2 of 26 patients) died as a result of neurological disease. The routine use of therapeutic level antiseizure medication is emphasized, considering the findings of our review.",Excluded
2271,"Quantitative analysis of conebeam CT for delineating stents in stent-assisted coil embolization BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Innovative techniques and device-related advances have improved the outcomes of neuroendovascular treatment. 3D imaging has previously used 2 < 2 binning, but 1 < 1 binning has recently been made available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative ability of conebeam CT for stent delineation and to investigate its effectiveness in the clinical environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four acquisition groups of 3D MIP images acquired using conebeam CT with varying conditions (acquisition time, 10 or 20 seconds and binning, 1 < 1 or 2 < 2) were compared. Two methods of analysis were performed, a phantom study and an analysis of 28 randomly selected patients. The phantom study assessed the contrast-to-noise ratio and full width at half maximum values in conebeam CT images of intracranial stent struts. In the clinical subjects, we assessed contrast-to-noise ratio, full width at half maximum, and dose-area product. RESULT(S): In the phantom study, the contrast-to-noise ratio was not considerably different between 10- and 20-second acquisition times at equivalent binning settings. Additionally, the contrast-to-noise ratio at equivalent acquisition times did not differ considerably by binning setting. For the full width at half maximum results, equivalent acquisition times differed significantly by binning setting. In the clinical analyses, the 10-second/1 < 1 group (versus 20 second/2 < 2) showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio (P .05) and a dose-area product reduced by approximately 70% (P .05), but the difference in full width at half maximum was not significant (P<.20). CONCLUSION(S): For stent-assisted coil embolization, quantitative assessment of conebeam CT showed that 10 second/1 < 1 was equivalent to 20 second/2 < 2 for imaging deployed intracranial stents. Furthermore, the 10-second/1 < 1 settings resulted in a much smaller DAP. Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1845,"Validation of a death assay for Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae (L3) using propidium iodide in a rat model (Rattus norvegicus) Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a pathogenic nematode and the cause of neuroangiostrongyliasis, an eosinophilic meningitis more commonly known as rat lungworm disease. Transmission is thought to be primarily due to ingestion of infective third stage larvae (L3) in gastropods, on produce, or in contaminated water. The gold standard to determine the effects of physical and chemical treatments on the infectivity of A. cantonensis L3 larvae is to infect rodents with treated L3 larvae and monitor for infection, but animal studies are laborious and expensive and also raise ethical concerns. This study demonstrates propidium iodide (PI) to be a reliable marker of parasite death and loss of infective potential without adversely affecting the development and future reproduction of live A. cantonensis larvae.

2387,"Human glycine alpha1 receptor inhibition by quercetin is abolished or inversed by alpha267 mutations in transmembrane domain 2 Quercetin, one of the flavonoids, is a compound of low molecular weight found in fruits and vegetables. Besides its antioxidative effect, quercetin also shows a wide range of diverse neuropharmacological actions. However, the cellular mechanisms of quercetin's actions, especially on ligand-gated ion channels and synaptic transmissions, are not well studied. We investigated the effect of quercetin on the human glycine alpha1 receptor channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Application of quercetin reversibly inhibited glycine-induced current (I(Gly)). Quercetin's inhibition depends on its dose, with an IC(50) of 21.5+/-.2 microM. The inhibition was sensitive to membrane voltages. Site-directed mutations of S267 to S267Y but not S267A, S267F, S267G, S267K, S267L and S267T at transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) nearly abolished quercetin-induced inhibition of I(Gly). In contrast, in site-directed mutant receptors such as S267 to S267I, S267R and S267V, quercetin enhanced I(Gly) compared to the wild-type receptor.

2391,"Assessment of treatment response of concurrent pulsed radiotherapy (PRT) and temozolomide by micropet/CT in a murine orthotopic model of glioblastoma multiforme Purpose/Objective: Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors that are highly resistant to therapy. While conventional radiation therapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ) has improved median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months, the majority of patients succumb to this disease due to local failure. To overcome this resistance, we evaluated the efficacy of pulsed low-dose radiotherapy (PRT) combined with TMZ as a novel treatment strategy, and evaluated efficacy using 18F-FDG muPET/CT imaging and immunohistochemistry. Materials/Methods: Intracranial tumors were established by injecting U87 GBM cells in Nu-Foxn1nu mice using a stereotactic device. Tumor burden was determined by contrast-enhanced muCT and these volumes were applied to 18F-FDG muPET data to evaluate tumor metabolic activity (SUVmax). Six treatment groups were evaluated; 1) control 2) TMZ alone 3) RT alone 4) PRT alone 5) RT+TMZ 6) PRT+TMZ. Tumors were irradiated 7-10 days post-implantation to a total dose of 14 Gy over 7 consecutive days. Radiation was delivered using either a single 2 Gy dose/day (RT) or 10 pulses of 0.2 Gy with an inter-pulse interval of 3 minutes (PRT), to the same total daily dose of 2 Gy. TMZ (10mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1 hr prior to daily RT or PRT treatment. At sacrifice, tumors were harvested for immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TMZ (10mg/kg) produced a modest growth delay of 2 weeks compared with controls (p<0.05). Compared to TMZ alone, combining TMZ with RT or PRT resulted in an additional 3-4 week growth delay (p<0.01). PRT+TMZ also resulted in a larger decline in SUVmax after treatment than RT+TMZ (p=0.01), but the SUVmax rebounded for each group during regrowth. Less normal brain damage, as assessed by Nissl staining, was seen after PRT+TMZ as compared with RT+TMZ (p<0.01). Levels of tumor apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferation (Ki67) and recruitment of CD45+/F4/80+ macrophages to the invasive tumor margins were similar for both the RT+TMZ and the PRT+TMZ treated groups. Significantly, CD45+/CD133+ bone marrow-derived cells were only seen in the hypoxic regions of tumors treated with TMZ alone or RT+/-TMZ, and not in tumors that that received PRT+/-TMZ. Conclusion(s): PRT+TMZ proved to be the most efficacious treatment, with diminished normal tissue side effects, as compared to the other treatment groups. Although the overall rate of tumor regrowth was similar after PRT+TMZ and RT+TMZ, PRT+TMZ produced a more effective initial response as determined by tumor volume and SUVmax. Interestingly, while normal tissue sparing with PRT was expected, the recruitment of the CD45+/CD133+ subpopulation of bone marrow-derived monocytic lineage cells to the hypoxic regions of other groups was unanticipated. These CD45+/CD133+ cells may ultimately be responsible for a microenvironment that causes faster regrowth. However, since the PRT-TMZ treated tumors regrew without CD45+/CD133+ cell recruitment, this suggests that there is an alternative pathway, and/or associated cell types, that are responsible for post-treatment tumor progression. This pathway may present an additional novel target for inhibition in multimodal treatment strategies for GBM.",Excluded
1855,"Enhanced excitability induced by ionizing radiation in the kindled rat Evidence derived from both clinical and experimental investigations has suggested an influence of ionizing radiation on focal epileptogenicity. To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala. The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes. Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala, after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation. The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated (60)Co source (1.25 MeV). Generalized seizure thresholds were then redetermined at weekly intervals for 10 weeks and at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months. We observed no significant changes in seizure threshold during the postirradiation interval; however, we did observe persistent changes in seizure dynamics manifesting within the first week postirradiation. These consisted of an increased tendency for seizure activity to propagate into brain stem circuits during the primary ictus (i.e., ""running fits"") and an increased tendency for secondary convulsions to emerge postictally. These effects involving seizure dynamics have not been reported previously and appear to represent a radiation-induced disinhibition of one or more neural circuits. The disparity between these effects and earlier reports of seizure-suppressive effects resulting from analogous radiation exposures is discussed in relation to kindling and status epilepticus-induced pathogenesis within the hippocampus.",Included

We review several common CNS pathologies that affect the HIV infected patients and discuss their MR imaging features. Our hospital provides a dedicated service to this small group of patients for the state. MR imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of CNS manifestation of HIV infection. The spectrum of disease can be categorised into 4 groups: 1. Direct consequence of HIV virus: HIV encephalitis - HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) - AIDS dementia complex. 2. Opportunistic infections including toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), tuberculosis, cryptococcosis and cytomegalovirus infection. 3. Neoplasm predominantly due to CNS lymphoma. 4. Consequence of HIV treatment: Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to antiviral treatment.

1619,"Characterisation of an allosteric modulatory protein associated with alpha-[3H]amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate binding sites in chick telencephalon: effects of high-energy radiation and detergent solubilisation alpha-[3H]Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate ([3H]AMPA) binds to 1-day-old chick telencephalon membranes with KD and Bmax values of 138 nM and 2.56 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. High-energy radiation bombardment of intact frozen telencephalon resulted in a biphasic inactivation curve for [3H]AMPA binding. At a 5.8-Mrad radiation dose, the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding was increased (54 nM), but there was no apparent alteration in the Bmax value (2.76 pmol/mg of protein). We attribute this phenomenon to the inactivation of a high molecular weight modulatory protein that down-regulates the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding. The estimated molecular masses of the AMPA binding site and of the modulatory component were 59 and 108 kDa, respectively. Solubilisation with n-octyl-beta-glucopyranoside resulted in an increase in the Bmax (4.7 pmol/mg of protein) with no pronounced alteration in the affinity (109 nM) of [3H]AMPA binding. However, the solubilisation-induced increase in Bmax did not occur in telencephalon irradiated before solubilisation. In contrast, the increase in affinity induced by radiation treatment was still detected in solubilised extracts. These results suggest that the number and affinity of [3H]AMPA sites in chick telencephalon are closely regulated and that the modulatory systems involved are affected by both irradiation and solubilisation.",Excluded
2145,"Rod visual pigment optimizes active state to achieve efficient G protein activation as compared with cone visual pigments Most vertebrate retinas contain two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which show different photoresponses to mediate scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. These cells contain different types of visual pigments, rhodopsin and cone visual pigments, respectively, but little is known about the molecular properties of cone visual pigments under physiological conditions, making it difficult to link the molecular properties of rhodopsin and cone visual pigments with the differences in photoresponse between rods and cones. Here we prepared bovine and mouse rhodopsin (bvRh and mRh) and chicken and mouse green-sensitive cone visual pigments (cG and mG) embedded in nanodiscs and applied time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to compare their Gt activation efficiencies. Rhodopsin exhibited greater Gt activation efficiencies than cone visual pigments. Especially, the Gt activation efficiency of mRh was about 2.5-fold greater than that of mG at 37 degreeC, which is consistent with our previous electrophysiological data of knock-in mice. Although the active state (Meta-II) was in equilibrium with inactive states (Meta-I and Meta-III), quantitative determination of Meta-II in the equilibrium showed that the Gt activation efficiency per Meta-II of bvRh was also greater than those of cG and mG. These results indicated that efficient Gt activation by rhodopsin, resulting from an optimized active state of rhodopsin, is one of the causes of the high amplification efficiency of rods.",Excluded
1279,"Carcinoma of the skin with perineural invasion Purpose. To evaluate the outcome and patterns of relapse in patients treated for skin carcinoma of the head and neck with either microscopic or clinical perineural invasion. Methods and Materials. Radiotherapy alone or combined with surgery was used to treat 135 patients with microscopic or clinical evidence of perineural invasion of skin carcinoma. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Results. The 5-year local control rates without salvage therapy were 87% with microscopic perineural invasion and 55% with clinical perineural invasion. Overall, 88% of the local failures occurred in patients with positive margins. Almost half of the recurrences in patients with microscopic perineural invasion were limited to the first-echelon regional nodes. However, only 1 of 11 patients with basal cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion had a nodal failure. Ninety percent of recurrences in patients with clinical perineural invasion occurred at the primary site. Cranial nerve deficits rarely improved after successful treatment of the primary disease. Radiographic abnormalities remained stable 30% of the time when patients had clinical evidence of progressive disease. Conclusions. Radiotherapy in patients with skin cancer with clinical perineural invasion should include treatment of the first-echelon regional lymphatics. The risk of regional node involvement is also relatively high for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion. In patients with clinical perineural invasion, the poor local control rates with conventional radiotherapy suggest a need for dose escalation with or without concomitant chemotherapy. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1328,"Primary CNS lymphoma Primary CNS lymphoma, an uncommon form of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, has increased in incidence and occurs in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompetent patients is associated with unique diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic issues and the management of this malignancy is different from other forms of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Characteristic imaging features should lead to suspicion of the diagnosis, avoidance of corticosteroids (if possible) and early neurosurgical consultation for stereotactic biopsy. Since primary CNS lymphoma may involve the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and eyes, diagnostic evaluation should include assessment of all of these regions as well as screening for the possibility of occult systemic disease. Resection provides no therapeutic benefit and should be reserved for the rare patient with neurological deterioration due to brain herniation. Whole-brain radiation therapy alone is insufficient for durable tumor control and is associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity in patients over 60 years of age. Neurotoxicity is typically associated with significant cognitive, motor and autonomic dysfunction and has a negative impact on quality of life. Chemotherapy and whole-brain radiation therapy together improve tumor response rates and survival compared with whole-brain radiation therapy alone. Methotrexate-based multiagent chemotherapy without whole-brain radiation therapy is associated with similar tumor response rates and survival compared with regimens that include whole-brain radiation therapy, although controlled trials have not been performed. The risk of neurotoxicity is lower in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The incidence of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma has decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Patients with HIV-associated primary CNS lymphoma have a worse prognosis but may respond to highly active antiretroviral therapy, whole-brain radiation therapy or therapies directed against the Epstein-Barr virus.

1503,"Complete homonymous hemianopia due to cerebral infarction of the lateral geniculate body: A case report with diffusion tensor image findings Background: The human lateral geniculate body (LGB) is the thalamic visual center linking the retina to the striate cortex. The human LGB has dual blood supplies from the anterior choroidal artery of the internal carotid artery and the lateral posterior choroidal artery of the posterior cerebral artery. Thus, complete homonemous hemianopia caused by cerebral infarction of the LGB is extremely rare. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented due to a sudden visual field defect. He had no other vascular risk factors or focal neurological deficits. Five days later, complete right homonymous hemianopia was detected by Humphrey automated perimetry. Brain MRI and DWI revealed an infarction at the left LGB. MRA revealed no obstruction or stenosis. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) showed decreased fractional anisotrophy value in the left occipital subcortical area (right, 0.436; left, 0.384). The density of optic radiation decreased more on the right side in tractography than on the left side. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Quadruple sectoranopia can be caused by lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the LGB which are supplied by the anterior choroidal artery. The lateral posterior choroidal artery supplies the central part of the LGB. Thus, occlusion of this artery produces a wedge-shaped homonymous hemianopsia or horizontal sectoranopia. However, despite the LGB lesion, our patient showed a complete homonemous hemianopia probably due to involvement of the whole LGB through occlusion of a variant vessel that supplied the whole LGB rather than simultaneous occlusion of 2 vessels.

2320,"Long-term trends in myocardial sympathetic innervation and function in synucleinopathies Introduction: Parkinson disease (PD), pure autonomic failure (PAF), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are characterized by intra-cerebral deposition of the protein alpha-synuclein and are termed synucleinopathies. Lewy body synucleinopathies involve decreased cardiac sympathetic innervation and functional abnormalities in residual noradrenergic terminals. This observational, retrospective, cohort study describes long-term trends in indices of cardiac sympathetic innervation and function in synucleinopathies. Method(s): Patients with PD (N = 31), PAF (N = 9), or MSA (N = 9) underwent repeated <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine positron emission tomography (median follow-up 3.5 years). Interventricular septal <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine-derived radioactivity 8 min after tracer injection (8' Radioactivity) was used as an index of sympathetic innervation and the slope of mono-exponential decline of radioactivity between 8 and 25 min (k<inf>8'-25'</inf>) as an index of intraneuronal vesicular storage. Healthy volunteers (HVs) (N = 33) and individuals at high risk of PD (N = 15) were controls. Result(s): Upon initial evaluation the groups with PD and orthostatic hypotension (OH), PAF, or PD and no OH had low mean 8' Radioactivity compared to HVs (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0002, p = 0.006) and had elevated k<inf>8'-25'</inf> (p = 0.0007, p = 0.007, p = 0.06). There was no significant difference between MSA and HVs. In PD 8' Radioactivity decreased by a median of 4% per year and did not decrease in MSA. k<inf>8'-25'</inf> values did not change during follow-up in any group. Conclusion(s): Neuroimaging evidence of decreased vesicular uptake in cardiac sympathetic nerves is present upon initial evaluation of patients with Lewy body synucleinopathies and may provide a biomarker of catecholaminergic dysfunction early in the disease process.

1924,"Non-thermal resistive switching in Mott insulator nanowires Resistive switching can be achieved in a Mott insulator by applying current/voltage, which triggers an insulator-metal transition (IMT). This phenomenon is key for understanding IMT physics and developing novel memory elements and brain-inspired technology. Despite this, the roles of electric field and Joule heating in the switching process remain controversial. Using nanowires of two archetypal Mott insulators-VO<inf>2</inf> and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> we unequivocally show that a purely non-thermal electrical IMT can occur in both materials. The mechanism behind this effect is identified as field-assisted carrier generation leading to a doping driven IMT. This effect can be controlled by similar means in both VO<inf>2</inf> and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, suggesting that the proposed mechanism is generally applicable to Mott insulators. The energy consumption associated with the non-thermal IMT is extremely low, rivaling that of state-of-the-art electronics and biological neurons.

2348,"[Peculiarities of the neurological status and electroencephalogram in operators of the control unit of nuclear power station] One hundred and five operators of the control unit of the Kursk nuclear power station (NPS) have been studied: 45 people after the shift (main group) and 60 - in the day off. The shift was found to exert a significant influence on the functional state of the nervous system promoting the development or aggravation of autonomous dysfunction. In some cases, it causes an elevation of blood pressure to the level of risk for cerebral vascular disease. The effect of shift on the cerebral bioelectric activity of NPS operators manifests itself in the decrease of percentage of unchanged EEG, increase of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads. These changes may be caused by weariness as well as the effects of adverse factors the operators were exposed to at the NPS.

2140,"Visually induced initiation of Drosophila innate courtship-like following pursuit is mediated by central excitatory state The courtship ritual of male Drosophila represents an innate behaviour that is initiated by female-derived sensory stimuli. Here we report that moving light spots can induce courtship-like following pursuit in tethered wild-type male flies provided the fly is primed by optogenetic stimulation of specific dsx-expressing neuronal clusters in the lateral protocerebrum (LPR). Namely, stimulation of the pC1 neuronal cluster initiates unilateral wing extension and vibration of both sides, whereas stimulation of the pC2l cluster initiates only contralateral wing displays. In addition, stimulation of pC2l but not pC1 neurons induced abdominal bending and proboscis extension. Ca(2+) imaging of the pC1 cluster revealed periodic Ca(2+) rises, each corresponding to a turn of the male fly during courtship. In contrast, group-reared fru mutant males exhibit light spot-induced courtship pursuit without optogenetic priming. Ca(2+) imaging revealed enhanced responses of LPR neurons to visual stimuli in the mutants, suggesting a neural correlate of the light spot-induced courtship behaviour.",Excluded

Here, we show that the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) induces autophosphorylation of ATM on serine 1981 in unirradiated cells at concentrations that inhibit protein phosphatase 2A-like activity in vitro. OA did not induce gamma-H2AX foci, suggesting that it induces ATM autophosphorylation by inactivation of a protein phosphatase rather than by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. In support of this, we show that ATM interacts with the scaffolding (A) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), that the scaffolding and catalytic (C) subunits of PP2A interact with ATM in undamaged cells and that immunoprecipitates of ATM from undamaged cells contain PP2A-like protein phosphatase activity. Moreover, we show that IR induces phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of PP2A from ATM and loss of the associated protein phosphatase activity. We propose that PP2A plays an important role in the regulation of ATM autophosphorylation and activity in vivo.",Excluded

1287,"Leptin restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a chronic unpredictable stress model of depression and reverses glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling Stress and glucocorticoid stress hormones inhibit neurogenesis, whereas antidepressants increase neurogenesis and block stress-induced decrease in neurogenesis. Our previous studies have shown that leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone with antidepressant-like properties, promotes baseline neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. This study aimed to determine whether leptin is able to restore suppression of neurogenesis in a rat chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model of depression. Chronic treatment with leptin reversed the CUS-induced reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behaviors. Leptin treatment elicited a delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim behavioral despair test, and this effect was blocked by ablation of neurogenesis with X-irradiation. The functional isoform of the leptin receptor, LepRb, and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were colocalized in hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. Leptin treatment reversed the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX)-induced reduction of proliferation of cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from adult hippocampus. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that leptin and DEX converged on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and beta-catenin. While DEX decreased Ser9 phosphorylation and increased Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, leptin increased Ser9 phosphorylation and attenuated the effects of DEX at both Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation sites of GSK-3beta. Moreover, leptin increased total level and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a primary substrate of GSK-3beta and a key regulator in controlling hippocampal neural progenitor cell proliferation, and reversed the inhibitory effects of DEX on beta-catenin. Taken together, our results suggest that adult neurogenesis is involved in the delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like behavioral effects of leptin, and leptin treatment counteracts chronic stress and glucocorticoid-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis via activating the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",Excluded

2067,"X-ray and optical stereo-based 3D sensor fusion system for image-guided neurosurgery Purpose: In neurosurgery, an image-guided operation is performed to confirm that the surgical instruments reach the exact lesion position. Among the multiple imaging modalities, an X-ray fluoroscope mounted on C- or O-arm is widely used for monitoring the position of surgical instruments and the target position of the patient. However, frequently used fluoroscopy can result in relatively high radiation doses, particularly for complex interventional procedures. The proposed system can reduce radiation exposure and provide the accurate three-dimensional (3D) position information of surgical instruments and the target position. Method(s): X-ray and optical stereo vision systems have been proposed for the C- or O-arm. Two subsystems have same optical axis and are calibrated simultaneously. This provides easy augmentation of the camera image and the X-ray image. Further, the 3D measurement of both systems can be defined in a common coordinate space. Result(s): The proposed dual stereoscopic imaging system is designed and implemented for mounting on an O-arm. The calibration error of the 3D coordinates of the optical stereo and X-ray stereo is within 0.1 mm in terms of the mean and the standard deviation. Further, image augmentation with the camera image and the X-ray image using an artificial skull phantom is achieved. Conclusion(s): As the developed dual stereoscopic imaging system provides 3D coordinates of the point of interest in both optical images and fluoroscopic images, it can be used by surgeons to confirm the position of surgical instruments in a 3D space with minimum radiation exposure and to verify whether the instruments reach the surgical target observed in fluoroscopic images.

1306,"Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and structural chromosome aberration in mutagenicity testing Data from previous studies published on the induction by mutagens of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and structural chromosome damage were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Although a good correlation between the incidence of both cytogenetic phenomena has been pointed out in many previous publications, about 30% of the agents for which comparable data were available yielded non-corresponding qualitative results concerning both indicator effects. However, even in groups with good qualitative agreement distinct quantitative differences indicated different molecular mechanisms of the formation of SCEs and breaks. Additional information supporting the importance of these differences for the validity of both indicator systems has been derived from the results obtained using strong clastogens exhibiting a low or no SCE-inducing activity and vice versa, from special observations on chromosomal breakage syndromes, and from studies on the action of known co- and anti-clastogens on SCE-induction by chemical mutagens.

1851,"CRF-like receptor SEB-3 in sex-common interneurons potentiates stress handling and reproductive drive in C. elegans Environmental conditions can modulate innate behaviours. Although male Caenorhabditis elegans copulation can be perturbed in the presence of stress, the mechanisms underlying its decision to sustain copulation are unclear. Here we describe a mating interference assay, which quantifies the persistence of male C. elegans copulation in noxious blue light. We show that between copulations, the male escapes from blue light illumination at intensities over 370 muW mm(-2). This response is attenuated in mutants with constitutive activation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor family homologue SEB-3. We show that activation of this receptor causes sex-common glutamatergic lumbar ganglion interneurons (LUA) to potentiate downstream male-specific reproduction circuits, allowing copulatory behaviours to partially override the light-induced escape responses in the male. SEB-3 activation in LUA also potentiates copulation during mild starvation. We suggest that SEB-3 activation allows C. elegans to acclimate to the environment and thus continue to execute innate behaviours even under non-optimal conditions.",Excluded
2039,"PAK4 governs radiation-induced endothelial GRO-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling and angiogenesis in glioma Aberrant neovascularization is a pathological hallmark of glioblastoma that correlates with poor clinical outcome. Factors that drive endothelial proliferation, recruitment into the tumor and angiogenesis in the context of radiotherapy are potentially novel therapeutic targets for glioma. Our studies showed high expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in gliomas; analyses of conditioned medium (CM) prepared from shRNA-mediated PAK4-knockdown (PAK4.sh) glioma cells using a human angiogenesis array showed a significant downregulation in key angiogenic factors including Gro-1alpha. Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included
1729,"Protection of normal brain cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis by a mitochondria-targeted triphenyl-phosphonium-nitroxide: a possible utility in glioblastoma therapy Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included
2283,"[Palliation of brain metastases: factors associated with survival] One hundred ten patients with brain metastases (76 lung cancer, 11 breast cancer, 7 colorectal cancer and others) were treated with radiotherapy, and the results were retrospectively evaluated. Neurologic symptoms were improved in 66% of patients. The relationship between improvement of neurologic symptoms and several factors, including irradiation dose, primary lesion, histology, term between first treatment and recurrence, clinical symptoms and CT findings, was analyzed. There was no significant correlation between symptom relief and these factors except for the number of metastatic lesions. Four of 110 patients could survive more than 2 years after radiotherapy: one with lung cancer, one with breast cancer, one with rectum cancer and one with uterine cancer. The factors that were analyzed for symptom relief were also studied to determine their effect on the survival of lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The patients who had higher dose irradiation (50 Gy) of improvement of neurological symptoms after radiotherapy survived significantly longer than those who had 30 Gy of irradiation or no symptom relief. Multivariate analysis of these factors showed that improvement of symptoms and irradiation dose were similarly important prognostic factors, whereas the others were not correlated with survival.",Excluded
1559,"Experimental glutamatergic excitotoxicity in rabbit retinal ganglion cells: block by memantine PURPOSE: Excessive activity of NMDA-type (N-methyl-d-aspartate) glutamatergic channels has been implicated as a mechanism for neuronal injury in neurologic disorders, including glaucoma, and retinal disease. This study was designed to characterize the retinal response to experimental manipulations that mimic features of glutamatergic excitotoxic insult and also to determine whether memantine, an NMDA-type glutamatergic channel blocker, is effective in reversing experimental excitotoxicity.METHODS: Recordings of the electroretinogram (ERG) and spiking activity of single retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were made from rabbit retinas. Excitotoxic insult was induced by either (1) application of NMDA, a selective NMDA receptor agonist; (2) application of TBOA (dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid), a selective inhibitor of glutamate transporters, or (3) perfusion with magnesium-free medium. For each condition, memantine was coapplied to determine its efficacy for reversal of experimental excitotoxicity. Memantine was also applied in isolation to characterize any effect on retinal responses to light stimuli.RESULTS: All three experimental manipulations were associated with an increase in the tonic level of RGC spiking activity, a reduction in RGC spike amplitude, and, in some cells, block of spike generation. Experimental excitotoxicity had little or no effect on ERG responses. Coapplication of memantine was associated with recovery of RGC tonic spiking activity and spike amplitude toward control levels. Application of memantine in isolation was associated with a dose-dependent effect on the timing of ERG and RGC-OFF responses.CONCLUSIONS: Memantine was effective in reversing acute experimental excitotoxicity at concentrations that have little effect on retinal light signaling.",Excluded
1634,"Genetic delivery of a miRNA cluster with polycistronic siRNAs reduces expression of epidermal growth receptor in human glioblastoma cells Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignancy of the brain, is a grade IV astrocytoma. It is one of the most rapidly growing and invasive types of glial tumors. The standard therapy includes surgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy with a median survival of about 14 months. In addition, systemic therapies are limited by the blood-brain barrier. To bypass the barrier, we are developing a gene delivery strategy to inhibit the expression of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR), which are commonly upregulated in GBM. One TKR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is overexpressed in GBM leading to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Our approach is to recruit the RNA interference pathway. Although small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are often utilized to silence gene expression, exogenously expressed siRNAs are not an effective strategy to treat human disease due to both extracellular and intracellular nucleases as well as activation of cellular immunity against foreign nucleic acids. To bypass these degradatory mechanisms, we use a natural miRNA cluster genetic background to effectively deliver the DNA encoding multiple anti-EGFR siRNAs by inserting them into the tertiary structure of the miRNA cluster, miR-17-92. The anti-EGFR polycistronic miRNA cluster (pAAV-miR-IP1) expresses six siRNAs directed against EGFR, specifically targeting the extracellular ligand binding domain, transmembrane domain, intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and 3' untranslated region of the EGFR transcript. The vector, pAAV-miR-IP1, was transfected into the human GBM cell lines, A172 and U87MG. Results demonstrate that pAAV-miR-IP1 was expressed at high levels with a subsequent reduction in EGFR mRNA expression. Additional strategies include using the polycistronic delivery mechanism to target multiple TKRs in addition to EGFR.",Excluded

In this study, we present opinions prepared by participants of the meeting, focusing on the most promising areas of research, immediate and future goals for the field, and the potential for hormesis theory to inform tDCS research. Scientific, medical, and ethical considerations support the ongoing testing of tDCS in healthy and clinical populations, provided best protocols are used to maximize safety. Notwithstanding the need for ongoing research, promising applications include enhancing vigilance/attention in healthy volunteers, which can accelerate training and support learning. Commonly, tDCS is used as an adjunct to training/rehabilitation tasks with the goal of leftward shift in the learning/treatment effect curves. Although trials are encouraging, elucidating the basic mechanisms of tDCS will accelerate validation and adoption. To this end, biomarkers (eg, clinical neuroimaging and findings from animal models) can support hypotheses linking neurobiological mechanisms and behavioral effects. Dosage can be optimized using computational models of current flow and understanding dose-response. Both biomarkers and dosimetry should guide individualized interventions with the goal of reducing variability. Insights from other applied energy domains, including ionizing radiation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and low-level laser (light) therapy, can be prudently leveraged.",Excluded

1603,"Thermoregulation in pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana, Ord) in winter Conservation of energy is a prerequisite thermoregulatory strategy for survival in northern hemisphere winters. We have used thermistor/data logger assemblies to measure temperatures in the brain, carotid artery, jugular vein and abdominal cavity, in pronghorn antelope to determine their winter body temperature and to investigate whether the carotid rete has a survival role. Over the study period mean black globe and air temperature were -0.5+/-3.2 degrees C and -2.0+/-3.4 degrees C, respectively, and mean daytime solar radiation was approximately 186 W m(-2). Brain temperature (T(brain), 39.3+/-0.3 degrees C) was higher than carotid blood temperature (T(carotid), 38.5+/-0.4 degrees C), and higher than jugular temperature (T(jugular), 37.9+/-0.7 degrees C). Minimum T(brain) (38.5+/-0.4 degrees C) and T(carotid) (37.8+/-0.2 degrees C) in winter were higher than the minimum T(brain) (37.7+/-0.5 degrees C) and T(carotid) (36.4+/-0.8 degrees C) in summer that we have reported previously. Compared with summer, winter body temperature patterns were characterized by an absence of selective brain cooling (SBC), a higher range of T(brain), a range of T(carotid) that was significantly narrower (1.8 degrees C) than in summer (3.1 degrees C), and changes in T(carotid) and T(brain) that were more highly correlated (r=0.99 in winter vs r=0.83 in summer). These findings suggest that in winter the effects of the carotid rete are reduced, which eliminates SBC and prevents independent regulation of T(brain), thus coupling T(brain) to T(carotid). The net effect is that T(carotid) varies little. A possible consequence is depression of metabolism, with the survival advantage of conservation of energy. These findings also suggest that the carotid rete has wider thermoregulatory effects than its traditional SBC function.",Excluded

Methods Included in this study were 153 patients, who had ruptured and microsurgical-clipped aneurysms. All patients underwent dual-source computed tomography examination of electrocardiography-gated dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography before clipping. Original scanning data were reconstructed to produce 20 data sets of cardiac cycles with 5% time intervals. The aneurysm neck, transverse and longitudinal diameters, and volume from the 20 groups of images were measured to calculate their respective change rates. In addition, other data and clinical characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed by logistic regression to identify factors associated with IAR. Results Of the 153 patients, 24 patients experienced IAR. Multivariable analysis revealed that the aneurysm neck change rate (P = 0.0001; odds ratio, 1.276) and aspect ratio (height/neck ratio, P = 0.025; odds ratio, 2.387) are predictors for IAR. When the change rate was greater than or equal to 60%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 76.7%, respectively. Conclusions Aneurysm neck change rate is independent predictor of IAR.

As with ionizing radiation, no defect has been observed in the overall rejoining of single or double-strand breaks produced by bleomycin. Since, however, only apyrimidinic (and to a lesser extent apurinic) sites and strand breaks are known to be produced by bleomycin, we tentatively suggest that AT cells are unable to rejoin a very small fraction of the total strand breaks.

Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD<sup>+</sup>, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.",Excluded
2417,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded
1988,"Study of antioxidative effects and anti-inflammatory effects in mice due to low-dose X-irradiation or radon inhalation Low-dose irradiation induces various stimulating effects, especially activation of the biological defense system including antioxidative and immune functions. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cell damage and death and can induce many types of diseases. This paper reviews new insights into inhibition of ROS-related diseases with low-dose irradiation or radon inhalation. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before or after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment inhibits hepatopathy in mice. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before ischemia-reperfusion injury or cold-induced brain injury also inhibits edema. These findings suggest that low-dose X-irradiation has antioxidative effects due to blocking the damage induced by free radicals or ROS. Moreover, radon inhalation increases superoxide dismutase activity in many organs and inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. These findings suggest that radon inhalation also has antioxidative effects. This antioxidative effect against CCl4-induced hepatopathy is comparable to treatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at a dose of 500 mg/kg weight, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment at a dose of 300 mg/kg weight, and is due to activation of antioxidative functions. In addition, radon inhalation inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema, suggesting that radon inhalation has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, radon inhalation inhibits formalin-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that radon inhalation relieves pain. Thus, low-dose irradiation very likely activates the defense systems in the body, and therefore, contributes to preventing or reducing ROS-related injuries, which are thought to involve peroxidation.",Included

We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice.

This report provides safety information from preclinical toxicology studies and first-in-human whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry studies of [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 for its potential application in human brain imaging studies.PROCEDURES: MK-6240 was administered intravenously (IV) in a 7-day rat toxicity study at x 50, x 100, and x 1000 dose margins relative to projected highest clinical dose of 0.333 mug/kg. The IV formulation of MK-6240 for clinical use and the formulation used in the 7-day rat toxicity study was tested for hemolysis potential in human and Wistar rat whole blood. Sequential whole-body positron emission tomography scans were performed in three healthy young subjects after IV bolus injection of 180 +/- 0.3 MBq [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 to characterize organ biodistribution and estimate whole-body radiation exposure (effective dose).RESULTS: MK-6240 administered IV in a 7-day rat toxicity study did not show any test article-related changes. The no-observed-adverse-effect level in rats was >= 333 mug/kg/day which provides a margin 1000-fold over an anticipated maximum clinical dose of 0.333 mug/kg. Additionally, the MK-6240 formulation was not hemolytic in human or Wistar rat blood. [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 activity was widely distributed to the brain and the rest of the body, with organ absorbed doses largest for the gall bladder (202 muGy/MBq).

The association between baseline folate quartile categories and baseline cognitive disorders [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia] was examined using binary logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding variables. The risks of incident MCI and dementia associated with the decline of serum folate level during a 4-year follow-up period were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results The lowest quartile group of serum folate (>=1.5, <=5.9 ng/mL) showed a higher risk of cognitive disorders than did the highest quartile group at baseline evaluation (odds ratio 1.314, p=0.012).

Fifty-four patients were females and 52 were males with a mean age of 68.2 years. Radiological iSAH progression was found in 2 of 106 (1.89) patients, and one of them was under antiplatelet therapy. No neurological deterioration was observed. Ten of 106 (9.4%) patients were under anticoagulation therapy, and 28 of 106 (26.4%) were under antiplatelet therapy.CONCLUSION: ISAH in mTBI seems to be a radiological stable entity over 72 h with no neurological deterioration. The clinical utility of a repeat head CT in such patients is questionable, considering its radiation exposure and cost. Regardless of anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, neurologic observation and symptomatic treatment solely could be a reasonable alternative.",Excluded
2315,"Comparison of internal dosimetry factors for three classes of adult computational phantoms with emphasis on I-131 in the thyroid The S values for 11 major target organs for I-131 in the thyroid were compared for three classes of adult computational human phantoms: stylized, voxel and hybrid phantoms. In addition, we compared specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) with the thyroid as a source region over a broader photon energy range than the x- and gamma-rays of I-131. The S and SAF values were calculated for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference voxel phantoms and the University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms by using the Monte Carlo transport method, while the S and SAF values for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) stylized phantoms were obtained from earlier publications. Phantoms in our calculations were for adults of both genders. The 11 target organs and tissues that were selected for the comparison of S values are brain, breast, stomach wall, small intestine wall, colon wall, heart wall, pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, lungs and active marrow for I-131 and thyroid as a source region. The comparisons showed, in general, an underestimation of S values reported for the stylized phantoms compared to the values based on the ICRP voxel and UF hybrid phantoms and relatively good agreement between the S values obtained for the ICRP and UF phantoms. Substantial differences were observed for some organs between the three types of phantoms. For example, the small intestine wall of ICRP male phantom and heart wall of ICRP female phantom showed up to eightfold and fourfold greater S values, respectively, compared to the reported values for the ORNL phantoms. UF male and female phantoms also showed significant differences compared to the ORNL phantom, 4.0-fold greater for the small intestine wall and 3.3-fold greater for the heart wall. In our method, we directly calculated the S values without using the SAFs as commonly done. Hence, we sought to confirm the differences observed in our S values by comparing the SAFs among the phantoms with the thyroid as a source region for selected target organs--small intestine wall, lungs, pancreas and breast--as well as illustrate differences in energy deposition across the energy range (12 photon energies from 0.01 to 4 MeV). Differences were found in the SAFs between phantoms in a similar manner as the differences observed in S values but with larger differences at lower photon energies. To investigate the differences observed in the S and SAF values, the chord length distributions (CLDs) were computed for the selected source--target pairs and compared across the phantoms. As demonstrated by the CLDs, we found that the differences between phantoms in those factors used in internal dosimetry were governed to a significant degree by inter-organ distances which are a function of organ shape as well as organ location.",Excluded
1716,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging as an evaluation of the response of brain metastases treated by stereotactic radiosurgery Background: Loss of tumor cell results in a relative increase in extracellular space that may lead to alteration of ADC. Our purpose was to see if the ADC could be used, rather than methods depending on changes in tumor size, to predict treatment success after treatment of brain metastases with SRS. Method(s): In a prospective study, the ADCs of 21 patients with 32 solid or solid-dominated brain metastases were taken before and 1 week, 1 month, and at 3-month intervals after SRS. Mean ADC values at the various time intervals were compared with each other to see whether or not the ADC might be used as an early indicator of treatment success or failure. Result(s): The mean pretreatment value of the ADC in the metastatic tumors was 1.05 +/- 0.12 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (mean +/- SD). This value for the tumors rose significantly (P = .009) 7 days after SRS and continued to rise with time. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that 91% of these tumors had been controlled by the SRS. The ADC values in cystic/necrotic tumor tissue (2.13 +/- 0.18 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) were significantly (P < .001) higher than those in noncentral necrotic tumor tissue (1.61 +/- 0.14 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s). Conclusion(s): The ADC values might eventually be useful to evaluate treatment success-and in some patients, detected even at early time points-and to distinguish radiation-induced central necrosis from tumor regrowth in cases where other imagery is not definitive. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

2217,"Proton radiation therapy for retinoblastoma: Comparison of various intraocular tumor locations and beam arrangements To study the optimization of proton beam arrangements for various intraocular tumor locations; and to correlate isodose distributions with various target and nontarget structures. We considered posterior-central, nasal, and temporal tumor locations, with straight, intrarotated, or extrarotated eye positions. Doses of 46 cobalt grey equivalent (CGE) to gross tumor volume (GTV) and 40 CGE to clinical target volume (CTV) (2 CGE per fraction) were assumed. Using three-dimensional planning, we compared isodose distributions for lateral, anterolateral oblique, and anteromedial oblique beams and dose-volume histograms of CTVs, GTVs, lens, lacrimal gland, bony orbit, and soft tissues. All beam arrangements fully covered GTVs and CTVs with optimal lens sparing. Only 15% of orbital bone received doses <20 CGE with a lateral beam, with 20-26 CGE delivered to two of three growth centers. The anterolateral oblique approach with an intrarotated eye resulted in additional reduction of bony volume and exposure of only one growth center. No appreciable dose was delivered to the contralateral eye, brain tissue, or pituitary gland. Proton therapy achieved homogeneous target coverage with true lens sparing. Doses to orbit structures, including bony growth centers, were minimized with different beam arrangements and eye positions.

However, the parameter has been observed to be significantly correlated to the speed of sound and density. These relationships are analyzed empirically as well as theoretically by developing a pressure-density relation based on a thermodynamic model and the Mie intermolecular potential. The results indicate that for many soft tissues, the coefficient of nonlinearity is largely determined by the isentropic compressibility, kappa<sub>s</sub>.

1991,"Set-up uncertainties: online correction with X-ray volume imaging AIM: To determine interfractional three-dimensional set-up errors using X-ray volumetric imaging (XVI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2007 and August 2009, 125 patients were taken up for image-guided radiotherapy using online XVI. After matching of reference and acquired volume view images, set-up errors in three translation directions were recorded and corrected online before treatment each day. Mean displacements, population systematic (SIGMA), and random (sigma) errors were calculated and analyzed using SPSS (v16) software. Optimum clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin was calculated using Van Herk's (2.5SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) and Stroom's (2SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) formula.RESULTS: Patients were grouped in 4 cohorts, namely brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis. The mean vector displacement recorded were 0.18 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.36 cm, and 0.35 cm for brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis, respectively. Analysis of individual mean set-up errors revealed good agreement with the proposed 0.3 cm isotropic margins for brain and 0.5 cm isotropic margins for head-neck. Similarly, 0.5 cm circumferential and 1 cm craniocaudal proposed margins were in agreement with thorax and abdomen-pelvic cases.CONCLUSION: The calculated mean displacements were well within CTV-PTV margin estimates of Van Herk (90% population coverage to minimum 95% prescribed dose) and Stroom (99% target volume coverage by 95% prescribed dose). Employing these individualized margins in a particular cohort ensure comparable target coverage as described in literature, which is further improved if XVI-aided set-up error detection and correction is used before treatment.",Excluded
1912,"Safety of 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a well-characterized hemoglobinopathy affecting more than 20 million individuals worldwide and carries an increased risk of cerebral vasculopathy, cerebral infarct, and stroke. As mechanisms of cerebral infarction in SCD are partly attributable to microvascular vaso-occlusive crises, manifesting as altered cerebral blood flow and associated impaired oxygen delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that can quickly provide a comprehensive perspective on structural and functional disease status, without exogenous contrast administration or ionizing radiation, have emerged as crucial clinical tools for surveillance. However, early ex vivo MRI work in suspended erythrocytes containing hemoglobin S at 0.35 Tesla (T) suggested that sickled erythrocytes can orient preferentially in the presence of an external magnetic field, and as such, it was suggested that MRI exams in sickle cell hemoglobinopathy could induce vaso-occlusion. While this observation has generally not impacted clinical imaging in individuals with SCD, it has led to resistance for some sickle cell studies within the engineering community among some imaging scientists as this early observation has never been rigorously shown to be unconcerning. Here, we performed MRI at the clinical field strength of 3 T in 172 patients with SCD, which included standard anatomical and angiographic assessments together with gold standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; spatial resolution = 1.8 x 1.8 x 4 mm; b-value = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) for acute infarct assessment (performed approximately 20 min after patient introduction to the field isocenter). The presence of vasculopathy, as well as chronic and acute infarcts, was evaluated by two independent board-certified radiologists using standard clinical criteria. In these patients (52.3% female; mean age = 19.6 years; age range = 6-44 years), hematocrit (mean = 25.8%; range = 15-36%), hemoglobin phenotype (87.8% HbSS variant), presence of silent infarct (44.2%), and overt chronic infarct (13.4%) were consistent with a typical SCD population; however, no participants exhibited evidence of acute infarction. These findings are consistent with 3 T MRI not inducing acute infarction or vaso-occlusion in individuals with SCD and suggest that earlier low-field ex vivo work of erythrocytes in suspension is not a sufficient cause to discourage MRI scans in patients with SCD.",Excluded
1810,"Evaluation of effective dose from a RANDO phantom in videofluorography diagnostic procedures for diagnosing dysphagia Objectives: Videofluorography (VF) is useful for diagnosing dysphagia; however, few reports have investigated appropriate effective doses for VF. The present study aimed to estimate the effective radiation dose in VF for diagnosis of dysphagia. Method(s): Radiation doses to tissues and organs were measured using the anthropomorphic RANDO woman phantom as an equivalent to the human body. Effective doses were estimated according to the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 60 in 1990 and IRCP 103 in 2007. The tissues measured were those recommended by ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 including gonads (ovaries and testes), red bone marrow and tissues in which excessive radiation commonly causes malignant tumours including lung, thyroid gland, stomach, large intestine, liver, oesophagus, bladder, breast, bone marrow, skin, brain and salivary gland. Skin dose was also measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Result(s): Using ICRP 103, the effective dose was estimated as 118.1 muSv at a tube voltage of 50 kV and 82.4 muSv at 45 kV. However, using ICRP 60 the effective dose for 1 min of VF was estimated at 62.4 muSv and 47.2 muSv under the same exposure conditions. Conclusion(s): Using ICRP 103, the effective dose for VF per examination at a total estimation time of 1 min was estimated as approximately 2.5-8.3 times that observed for digital panoramic radiography and 1/12 to 3 times depending on the measurement device for cone beam CT (CBCT).

1828,"Toward Improving Patients' Experiences of Acute Toxicity From Breast Radiotherapy: Insights From the Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Large Multicenter Cohort PURPOSE: Understanding acute toxicities after whole-breast radiotherapy is important to inform patients, guide treatment decisions, and target supportive care. We evaluated patient-reported outcomes prospectively collected from a cohort of patients with breast cancer.METHODS: We describe the maximal toxicity reported by 8,711 patients treated between 2012 and 2019 at 27 practices. Multivariable models identified characteristics associated with (1) breast pain, (2) bother from itching, stinging/burning, swelling, or hurting of the treated breast, and (3) fatigue within 7 days of completing whole-breast radiotherapy.RESULTS: Moderate or severe breast pain was reported by 3,233 (37.1%): 1,282 (28.9%) of those receiving hypofractionation and 1,951 (45.7%) of those receiving conventional fractionation. Frequent bother from at least one breast symptom was reported by 4,424 (50.8%): 1,833 (41.3%) after hypofractionation and 2,591 (60.7%) after conventional fractionation. Severe fatigue was reported by 2,008 (23.1%): 843 (19.0%) after hypofractionation and 1,165 (27.3%) after conventional fractionation. Among patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher body mass index (BMI; P < .001), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), smoking status (P < .001), larger breast volume (P = .002), lack of chemotherapy receipt (P = .004), receipt of boost treatment (P < .001), and treatment at a nonteaching center predicted breast pain.

2035,"The role of radiation and chemotherapy in adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas: results from the National Cancer Database INTRODUCTION: Surgical resection of high-grade brainstem gliomas is challenging and treatment mostly involves radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we utilized registry data to determine prognostic features and impact of chemotherapy and radiation on overall survival.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for adult cases with histologically confirmed high-grade brainstem glioma. Covariates including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and treatment parameters were captured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify predictors of survival.RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were analyzed. Most patients (66.6%) underwent postoperative radiation with chemotherapy, 9.2% underwent radiation alone, while the remaining had no postoperative treatment (24.2%). Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, postoperative chemotherapy with radiation was associated with significant survival benefit compared to radiation alone for grade IV (HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76, p = 0.003), but not for grade III tumors (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.58, p = 0.65).CONCLUSION: Analysis from a national registry illustrated the effectiveness of radiation with chemotherapy for adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas, particularly grade IV.

1863,"Focused ultrasound enhanced intranasal delivery of brain derived neurotrophic factor produces neurorestorative effects in a Parkinson's disease mouse model Focused ultrasound-enhanced intranasal (IN + FUS) delivery is a noninvasive approach that utilizes the olfactory pathway to administer pharmacological agents directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN + FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN + FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN + FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the method and potential of IN + FUS for the delivery of bioactive factors for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.",Excluded

The UV wavelength was 280 nm. The radiation-induced potential shift of the voltage-dependent gating parameters was prevented or even reversed by the action of the sulfhydryl compounds (internal application), while the blocking effect was not affected. It is concluded that the two radiation effects are caused by two separate photoreactions. Internally applied N-ethylmaleimide, binding specifically to protein-SH groups, exhibits an effect similar to the ultraviolet-induced potential shift, without affecting the maximum sodium permeability. Therefore, the ultraviolet-induced potential shift might be caused by a photocatalyzed oxidation of -SH groups of membrane proteins changing the surface charge density at the inner side of the nodal membrane.",Excluded

The objectives of the present study were to explore the clinical characteristics and potential prognostic factors in CRC patients with BM. Between April 1991 and December 2010, all CRC patients treated in the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed and 60 patients were identified to have BM (36 males and 24 females). The association between patients and their tumor characteristics, treatment modality, and survival were statistically analyzed. The median age at diagnosis of BM was 62.5 years. Fifty-three patients (88.3%) developed extracranial metastases at diagnosis of BM. The cause of death was systemic disease in 19 patients and neurological disease in 23 patients. Brain metastases were primarily treated with either whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT; 15 patients), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; nine patients), or surgical resection (seven patients). Ten patients received WBRT and SRS, and 19 patients (31.7%) were treated with steroids alone. The median survival after diagnosis of BM was 8 months (95% confidence interval = 4.2-11.8 months). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, the number of brain lesions, and treatment modality type were significantly associated with survival. Although BM from CRC is a late-stage phenomenon with an extremely poor prognosis, some subsets of patients would benefit from a multidisciplinary management strategy.

2100,"5-Aminolevulinic acid strongly enhances delayed intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by ionizing irradiation: quantitative analyses and visualization of intracellular ROS production in glioma cells in vitro Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has important roles in multimodal treatment for highly aggressive malignant gliomas. Previously, we demonstrated that multi-dose ionizing irradiation with repetitive administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) enhanced the host antitumor response and strongly inhibited tumor growth in experimental glioma. However, the mechanism of the radiosensitizing effect of 5-ALA is not known. Ionizing irradiation not only causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation initially by water radiolysis but also induces delayed production of mitochondrial ROS for mediating the long-lasting effects of ionizing irradiation on tumor cells. 5-ALA leads to high accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the mitochondria of tumor cells, yet can also improve dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in tumor cells. Here, we assessed the effect of 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis and delayed production of intracellular ROS after ionizing irradiation with 5-ALA in glioma cells in vitro. Temporal changes in intracellular 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis after ionizing irradiation in glioma cell lines were evaluated using flow cytometry (FCM). Then, the effect of 5-ALA on delayed production of intracellular ROS 12 h after ionizing irradiation in glioma cells was evaluated by FCM and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Ionizing irradiation had no effect on 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis in glioma cells. Delayed intracellular production of ROS was significantly higher than that just after ionizing irradiation, but 5-ALA pretreatment strongly enhanced the delayed intracellular production of ROS, mainly in the cytoplasm of glioma cells. This 5-ALA-induced increase in the delayed production of ROS tended to be higher in the case of 5-ALA treatment before rather than after ionizing irradiation. These results suggest that 5-ALA can affect tumor cells under ionizing irradiation, and greatly increase secondary intracellular production of ROS long after ionizing irradiation, thereby causing a radiosensitizing effect in glioma cells.",Excluded
1792,"A new UV-sensitive mutant that suggests a second excision repair pathway in Neurospora crassa In an attempt to understand the relationship between photorepair and dark repair in Neurospora crassa, a new mutant was isolated, which showed defects in both repair processes. The new mutant, mus-38, is moderately sensitive to UV and shows imperfect photoreactivation following UV irradiation. DNA was purified from this mutant and the other UV-sensitive mutants, and analyzed for the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). UV-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites (ESS) completely disappeared with 1 h of photoreactivation in mus-38 DNA, although the survival recovery with photoreactivation was greatly reduced in this mutant. This suggests that the insufficient survival recovery with photoreactivation in mus-38 does not result from a failure of photo-reversal of CPDs. Removal of ESS during liquid holding (dark repair) was slower in mus-38 compared to wild type. To test the possibility that this mutant was involved in excision repair, the double mutant was made between mus-38 and mus-18, which encodes a UV-damage-specific endonuclease. CPD excision in the mus-18 null mutant was severely affected but not completely inhibited. The double mutant showed a complete loss of the excision activity and was super sensitive to UV. These results indicate that mus-38 participates in an excision pathway that is different from the mus-18 pathway. The mus-38 mutant was sensitive not only to UV but also to some chemical mutagens which make adducts on DNA. Thus, mus-38 is possibly involved in an excision-repair pathway that is related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 pathway. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

2082,"Expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 in the rat brain after a single high-dose irradiation Cytokines and growth factors are important regulatory proteins controlling the growth and differentiation of normal and malignant glial cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and origin of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the subacute brain injury after a single high-dose irradiation using 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. The right cerebral hemispheres of rats were exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays using Ir-192. The radiation effect was assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after irradiation, and the results were compared with those in sham operation group. Histological changes characteristic of radiation injury were correlated with the duration after the single dose irradiation. The loss of cortical thickness also increased with the lapse of time after irradiation. The TNF-alpha expression in the irradiated cerebral hemispheres was significantly increased compared with that in the sham operation group. TGF-beta 1 expression was also increased in the irradiated hemispheres. Immunohistochemical study revealed that TGF-beta 1 was expressed predominantly by infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes around the necrotic areas. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 may play prominent roles in the radiation injuries after a single high-dose irradiation.",Included
1789,"A case of olfactory neuroblastoma. [Japanese] A case of olfactory neuroblastoma is reported. A 74-year-old man visited our hospital exhibiting left nasal obstruction and bleeding in May 1997. An examination revealed a large tumor in his left nasal cavity; its surface was smooth and it bled easily. The patient did not have any visual acuity difficulties and the cervical lymph nodes were not swollen. A CT scan revealed a large tumor in his left nasal cavity and maxillary sinus which did not extend into the cranial space or eye socket. There were no bone defects. The patient underwent surgery for an olfactory neuroblastoma in June 1997. Based on the pathological findings, we made a diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma. The patient was treated with radiation therapy after surgical therapy. 45 Gy radiation therapy was added. The patient was followed up for 1 year and 6 months. In January 1999, there was local tumor reccurence and the tumor invaded his brain. Unfortunately, he died soon after from this local recurrence of his brain tumor in June 1999.",Excluded
2272,"Risk Factor for Incident Functional Disability and the Effect of a Preventive Exercise Program: A 4-Year Prospective Cohort Study of Older Survivors from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for incident functional disability among long-term evacuees of Iitate village after Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster (GEJE). We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, both the group with low-participation in the exercise program and the group with high-participation in the exercise program had a significantly lower rate of incident functional disability compared to those who did not participate at all (HR = 0.27, CI: 0.16-0.46; HR = 0.30, CI: 0.12-0.74, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-disaster BCL domains were useful to identify individuals at risk of functional disability after a major socio-technical disaster. Therefore, this instrument can be used to identify at-risk older adults who would benefit from early exercise programs to prevent incident functional disability.",Included
2236,"Etoposide and cisplatin versus irinotecan and cisplatin in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer treated with etoposide and cisplatin plus concurrent accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy (JCOG0202): A randomised phase 3 study Background: Four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin and accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy (AHTRT) is the standard of care for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Irinotecan plus cisplatin significantly improved overall survival compared with etoposide plus cisplatin for extensive-stage SCLC. We compared these regimens for overall survival of patients with limited-stage SCLC. Method(s): We did this phase 3 study in 36 institutions in Japan. Eligibility criteria included age 20-70 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ functions. Eligible patients with previously untreated limited-stage SCLC received one cycle of etoposide plus cisplatin (intravenous etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-3; intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) plus AHTRT (1.5 Gy twice daily, 5 days a week, total 45 Gy over 3 weeks). Patients without progressive disease following induction therapy were randomised (1:1 ratio, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on ECOG performance status [0 vs 1], response to induction chemoradiotherapy [complete response plus near complete response vs partial response and stable disease], and institution) to receive either three further cycles of consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin or irinotecan plus cisplatin (intravenous irinotecan 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15; intravenous cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1). Patients, physicians, and investigators were aware of allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival after randomisation; primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144989, and the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000095. Finding(s): 281 patients were enrolled between Sept 1, 2002, and Oct 2, 2006. After induction etoposide plus cisplatin and AHTRT, 258 patients were randomised to consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin (n=129) or irinotecan plus cisplatin (n=129). In the etoposide plus cisplatin group, median overall survival was 3.2 years (95% CI 2.4-4.1). In the irinotecan and cisplatin group, median overall survival was 2.8 years (95% CI 2.4-3.6); overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 0.80-1.46], one-sided stratified log-rank p=0.70). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (120 [95%] in the etoposide plus cisplatin group vs 101 [78%] in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group), anaemia (44 [35%] vs 50 [39%]), thrombocytopenia (26 [21%] vs six [5%]), febrile neutropenia (21 [17%] vs 18 [14%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%] vs 13 [10%]). There was one treatment-related adverse event leading to death in each group (radiation pneumonitis in the etoposide plus cisplatin group; brain infarction in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group).

1512,"Dose-dependent effects of radiation therapy on cerebral blood flow, metabolism, and neurocognitive dysfunction PURPOSE: A prospective study was performed to formally relate dose-dependent radiologically defined changes in normal brain induced by radiotherapy (RT) to neurocognitive dysfunction in subjects with primary brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients receiving three-dimensional RT for central nervous system (CNS) tumors were enrolled. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and neuropsychological testing were performed before RT and 3 weeks and 6 months after treatment. Analyses were performed for correlations between changes in 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET (metabolism), (15)O-PET (relative blood flow), regional radiation dose, follow-up time, and neuropsychological test scores.RESULTS: Eleven subjects were enrolled and 6 completed follow-up studies. The PET data showed reduced FDG uptake, with average decreases of 2-6% in regions of the brain receiving greater than 40 Gy at 3 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The (15)O-H(2)O PET showed increases (<10%) at 3 weeks in relative regional blood flow in brain receiving greater than 30 Gy, but less at the 6-month follow-up studies. There were significant correlations between decreases in FDG uptake and increased scores from the Symptom Checklist-90-R, with an average increase in T score of 2 (p < 0.0001). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed a significant correlation of decreased FDG uptake with increased errors and perseveration in test performance, with an average decrease in T score of 11 (p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent response of CNS tissue was detected using FDG PET in this small number of patients. Decreases in CNS metabolism correlated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests for problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and global measures of psychopathology. Additional research is needed to verify and define these findings.",Excluded
1817,"Tumor treating fields: A novel therapy for glioblastoma multiforme Learning Objectives: To describe the rationale, indications, and literature supporting the use of Tumor Treating Fields in the first-line and second-line settings for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Main: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a novel anti-neoplastic treatment recently approved for clinical use for GBM. This new modality utilizes low intensity, intermediate frequency alternating electrical fields that have demonstrated anti-neoplastic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. The mechanism of action is postulated to include mitotic disruption at various points including dipole misalignment, impaired microtubule assembly, dielectrophoresis of intra-cellular molecules and organelle disruption, and asymmetric chromosome segregation. TTfields is delivered continuously to the brain by a patient-operated, wearable medical device (OptuneTM, Novocure Ltd.). A large (695 patients enrolled), international, randomized, phase 3 trial has recently confirmed the long-term efficacy of adding TTFields to standard maintenance chemotherapy after the completion of chemo-irradiation in newly diagnosed GBM. At 5-year follow-up, this trial demonstrated consistent superior tumor control (median PFS 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p = 0.00005) and significantly improved survival (median OS 20.9 vs. 16 months, 5-year OS 13% vs. 5%, p = 0.00006) with the addition of TTFields to the current standard of care therapy. The magnitude of improvement when adding TTFields is comparable to the benefit observed with adding chemotherapy to radiation (demonstrated over a decade ago). There was no significant toxicity observed with TTfields (most commonly, mild dermatitis), and patient-reported quality of life was unaffected. On subset analysis, both MGMT hypermethylation-positive and negative tumor subtypes were found to significantly benefit from TTF. In the second-line setting, a prior phase III trial has demonstrated equal efficacy but improved toxicity and quality of life profiles as compared to physician's choice of 2nd-line chemotherapy in GBM progressing after standard therapy. TTF is now endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for both the 1st line and 2nd-line setting in the treatment of GBM.",Excluded
1404,"Pion therapy at TRIUMF. Treatment results for astrocytoma grades 3 and 4: a pilot study At TRIUMF, (located on the University of B.C. Campus), 53 patients with supratentorial astrocytoma grades 3 and 4 were treated with pions between 1982 and 1985. A 3-dimensional spot-scanning treatment technique has proven to be practical. The accuracy of the beam alignment system used for treatment was reproducible daily within 2 mm. Low pion flux has hindered optimal beam shaping but this will soon be remedied as flux improves. The overall median survival observed (53 patients) is 262 days from date of first radiation treatment. Younger (less than 49 years) patients have significantly better survival than older (greater than 50 years) patients (p = 0.001). From a base line dose of 40 Gy photons whole brain and 17.5 Gy pion boost, doses were escalated to 33 Gy pions localised to the primary tumour and the median survival improved from 198 to 436 days. Survival curves for patients treated with localised pion techniques to doses above 30 Gy are significantly better than for those treated with schedules of pions mixed with photons (p = 0.04). It appears that optimal pion dose for brain tumours is 33 Gy minimum with a possible maximum of 36 Gy and doses delivered in 15 fractions in 3 weeks.

1329,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients.METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation.RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.",Excluded

1847,"Role of p53 in the regulation of irradiation-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells Wild-type p53 plays a crucial role in the control of apoptosis following ionizing radiation (IR); conversely, mutant p53 is associated with IR resistance. Although wild-type p53 is expressed in virtually all neuroblastoma tumors, treatment failures secondary to inadequate local control with radiotherapy are a problem in patients with advanced stage disease. This apparent paradox is the focus of our interest. The Shep-1 neuroblastoma cell line is highly resistant to IR. This cell line contains a wild-type p53 gene and is an ideal model for studying the mechanism of IR resistance in this disease. Following high-dose IR, cell fractionation demonstrated that p53 is induced and targeted to the nucleus. The induced p53 is functional as p53-responsive genes (Waf-1 and MDM-2) are appropriately induced following IR. Intriguingly, overexpression of p53 could reverse the inherent IR resistance of Shep-1 cells. Multiple cell lines expressing variable levels of exogenous temperature-sensitive p53 were generated. Pulse induction of p53 alone did not affect Shep-1 cell viability, while induction of p53, followed by IR, resulted in cell death and DNA fragmentation proportional to the dose of IR and the level of p53 expression. These findings demonstrate that p53 overexpression renders Shep-1 cells IR-sensitive and suggest that large quantities of exogenous p53 can overcome the factors inhibiting p53-mediated, IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded
2355,"Osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine: Surgical treatment or percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation? Osteoid osteoma (OO) of the cervical spine is frequently located close to the vertebral artery, spinal cord, or nerve roots and complete surgical excision is sometimes difficult by a limited approach and more extended surgery can require spinal fusion. Percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation (PRC) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of OO of the pelvis and limbs however, its role in the cervical spine is still nuclear. The Authors present a series of nine cases of OO of the cervical spine, six treated with surgical excision and three with PRC. No neurological or vascular complications occurred in both series. One case of the surgical series had only partial relief of persistent pain for 1 year due to incomplete excision, but is doing well 4 years after surgery. All the other surgical cases had complete relief of symptoms immediately after surgery and are symptom-free 3-10 years later. Two cases of PRC had complete relief of symptoms 24-48 h after surgery and are symptom-free 2 and 3 years later. One case of recurrent OO after surgery and treated with PRC with a reduced dose improved only, and still requires anti-inflammatory drugs 2 years after the procedure. Our still limited experience suggests that PRC can be safely performed in local anaesthesia with the patient awake, enabling to check for signs and symptoms of possible neurological injury. PRC can substitute extensive posterior approaches and reconstructions for OO of the posterior arch and joint pillar. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging failed to demonstrate typical appearance of venous malformation and showed atypical findings surrounding the suspected vascular lesion. Angiography was needed to obtain the diagnosis of venous malformation. The patient underwent subtotal resection of the glioblastoma and received radiation therapy.

Correct diagnosis of coexisting venous malformation is important for the treatment of an associated brain tumor, especially when both lesions are closely located. [References: 16]",Excluded
2056,"Similarity pattern analysis in mutational distributions The validity and applicability of the statistical procedure - similarity pattern analysis (SPAN) - to the study of mutational distributions (MDs) was demonstrated with two sets of data. The first was mutational spectra (MS) for 697 GC to AT transitions produced with eight alkylating agents (AAs) in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. The second was a recently summarized data on the distributions of 11562 spontaneous, radiation- and chemical-induced forward mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa. They were analyzed as large two-way contingency tables (CTs) where two kinds of profiles were compared: site (or genotypic class) profiles and origin (or mutagen) profiles. To measure similarity (homogeneity) between any pair of profiles, the relevant sufficient statistics, Kastenbaum-Hirotsu squared distance (KHi<sup>2</sup>), was used. Collapsing the similar profiles into distinct internally homogeneous clusters named 'collapsets' revealed their similarity pattern. To facilitate the procedure, the computer program, COLLAPSE, was elaborated. The results of SPAN for the lacI spectra were found comparable with the results of their previous analysis with two multivariate statistical methods, the factor and cluster analyses. In the ad-3 data set, five collapsets were revealed among origin profiles (OPs): (I) ENU=4NQO=4HAQO=FANFT=SQ18506; (II) AF-2=EI=MMS=DEP; (III) ETO=UV; (IV) AHA=PROCARB; and (V) He ions=protons. Moreover, the previous observation that MDs are dose-dependent was confirmed for X-ray-induced MDs. Profiles induced with the low doses of X-rays are similar to that induced with <sup>85</sup>Sr, and profiles induced with the medium X-ray doses to those induced with protons and He ions. Evaluated similarities appear to be rather reasonable: mutagens with similar mode of action induce similar MDs. Similarity pattern revealed among genotypic class profiles (GCPs) seems to be also interpretable. When supplemented with descriptive cluster analysis, SPAN appears to be a fruitful methodology in MS analysis. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
1652,"Relative contributions of radiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy to sensorineural hearing loss in head-and-neck cancer patients PURPOSE: To investigate the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in patients with head-and-neck cancer and treated with radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, the relationship among SNHL and radiation dose to the cochlea, the use of two common cisplatin dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 62 head-and-neck cancer patients treated with curative intent were included in this prospective study. Of the patients, 21 received RT alone, 27 received 40 mg/m(2) weekly cisplatin, 13 received 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks during RT, and 1 received RT with weekly epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor antibody. The effect of chemotherapy and RT dose on hearing was determined using a model that accounted for the age and variability between each ear for each patient.RESULTS: We constructed a model to predict dose-dependent hearing loss for RT or cisplatin-based chemotherapy either alone or in combination. For patients only receiving RT, no significant hearing loss was found at doses to the cochlea of less than 40 Gy. Patients receiving 100 mg/m(2) or 40 mg/m(2) of cisplatin chemotherapy had an estimated +21.5 dB and +9.5 dB hearing loss at 8,000 Hz with low radiation doses (10 Gy), which rose to +38.4 dB and +18.9 dB for high radiation doses (40 Gy).CONCLUSIONS: Use of RT alone with doses of less than 40 Gy did not result in clinically significant hearing loss. High-frequency SNHL was profoundly damaged in patients who received concomitant cisplatin when doses of 100 mg/m(2) were used. The threshold cochlear dose for hearing loss with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and RT was predicted to be 10 Gy. The inner ear radiation dose constraints and cisplatin dose intensity should be considered in the treatment of advanced head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded

This prospective study analyzed potential risk factors and investigated the impact of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring.METHOD: Included were 85 patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, 43 under the control of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring. Urogenital function was assessed with validated questionnaires within a 2-year follow-up period. Potential risk factors were identified by multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Overall, approximately one-third of treated patients suffered from new onset of urinary dysfunction. Initially, half of the sexually active patients were affected by sexual dysfunction; after 2 years, almost three quarters were affected. In the pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring group, urinary and sexual dysfunction rates including minor and major disturbances were significantly lower (2-year follow-up 20% vs. 51% (p = 0.004) and 56% vs. 90% (p = 0.010)). Throughout the survey, non-performance of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring was found to be an independent risk factor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was identified as an independent predictor for urogenital dysfunction in the further course one and 2 years after surgery.CONCLUSION: Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and sexual dysfunction in the short and long run, whereas neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has a negative impact only in the long run.",Excluded
1413,"CT and MR imaging in Hodgkin's disease - Present and future Initial staging of Hodgkin's disease is crucial to determine the location and extent of disease, and is the hallmark for the choice of treatment. At present, the established radiological technique for staging Hodgkin's disease is computed tomography (CT). Modern multidetector row CT scanners allow fast imaging from the scull base to the groins during a single breath hold with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 mm. Both, nodal and extranodal involvement of Hodgkin's disease can be diagnosed with CT. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is another useful cross-sectional imaging modality for staging Hodgkin's disease. The development of fast MR imaging techniques has considerably reduced imaging time without compromising the quality of MR images. As a consequence, MR imaging is now considered to be as diagnostic as CT for staging Hodgkin's disease. The excellent soft-tissue contrast and the lack of exposure to ionizing radiation are the main advantages of MR imaging. For the detection of extranodal Hodgkin's disease, MR imaging is superior to assess involvement of the brain, the spinal cord and bone marrow; while CT allows excellent evaluation of lung disease. Common major problems in staging Hodgkin's disease are still the detection of nodal involvement in normal sized lymph nodes and residual tumor masses after therapy. In the future, newly developed lymphotropic contrast agents for MR imaging might be helpful to answer these questions. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.",Excluded

We analyzed demography, treatment and survival outcome data of 56 patients of ODG registered in our institute from 2000 to 2013. Method(s): All patients (Pts) underwent maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant RT 60 Gy in 30 fractions. After 2004, pts underwent chemoradiation with daily Temozolomide TMZ) (75 mg/m2) and maintenance TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 D1-D5) for a total of six cycles. An event was described as death for overall survival, progression/ recurrence of disease, or neuro-deterioration for progression free survival. Log-rank test was used to compare event-free survival (EFS) distribution. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (range-19-77). 39 patients were male and 17 patients were female with a male: female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache was the commonest symptom seen in 56.4% patients followed by seizures (53.8%) and motor deficit (12.8%).Median duration of symptoms was 8.5 months. Frontal location was most common in 66% of the patients followed by temporal and parietal location (12.5% each). 46(82.1%) patients had pure anaplastic ODG histology while 10(17.9%) patients had mixed anaplastic oligodendroglial tumor. 29(51.8%) patients underwent a gross total excision while others underwent a subtotal resection or a biopsy only. All patients except one underwent adjuvant RT with a median dose of 60 Gy (range 40-60 Gy). 38(67.9%) patients had recieved concurrent chemotherapy and 31(55.4%) patients also recieved adjuvant chemotherapy.

Material(s) and Method(s): 32 patients with histopathologically confirmed NET treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq/m<sup>2</sup> cumulative dose) and 30 NHL patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (1200 MBq max dose) were enrolled in the study. The kidney function and changes of blood indices were assessed during the course of the therapy. Result(s): 59% of NET patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE displayed transient reduction of blood indices, the largest after cycles III and IV of therapy. After 5 months an increase in creatinine level was noticed, but no statistically important changes in creatinine level and GFR were observed. In the group of patients with NHL, the change of haematological indices after RIT concerned mainly PLT, ANC and WBC. The reduction of the average PLT and WBC values started in the first weeks after the treatment application, reaching nadir in the 6th week and 8th week, respectively. No life threatening infections were observed in either group of patients. Conclusion(s): After treatment with the use of the <sup>90</sup>Y radionuclide, no significant treatment toxicity, including disorders involving the critical organs for both types of therapies, was found in the groups of neuroendocrine tumour and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

2334,"Transcranial near-infrared light therapy improves motor function following embolic strokes in rabbits: an extended therapeutic window study using continuous and pulse frequency delivery modes Photon or near-infrared light therapy (NILT) may be an effective neuroprotective method to reduce behavioral dysfunction following an acute ischemic stroke. We evaluated the effects of continuous wave (CW) or pulse wave (P) NILT administered transcranially either 6 or 12 h following embolization, on behavioral outcome. For the studies, we used the rabbit small clot embolic stroke model (RSCEM) using three different treatment regimens: 1) CW power density of 7.5 mW/cm(2); 2) P1 using a frequency of 300 mus pulse at 1 kHz or 3) P2 using a frequency of 2 ms pulse at 100 Hz. Behavioral analysis was conducted 48 h after embolization, allowing for the determination of the effective stroke dose (P(50)) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits. Using the RSCEM, a treatment is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P(50) compared with the control group. Quantal dose-response analysis showed that the control group P(50) value was 1.01+/-0.25 mg (n=31). NILT initiated 6 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.06+/-0.59 mg (n=29, P=0.099); (P1) 1.89+/-0.29 mg (n=25, P=0.0248) and (P2) 1.92+/-0.15 mg (n=33, P=0.0024). NILT started 12 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.89+/-1.76 mg (n=29, P=0.279); (P1) 2.40+/-0.99 mg (n=24, P=0.134). At the 6-h post-embolization treatment time, there was a statistically significant increase in P(50) values compared with control for both pulse P1 and P2 modes, but not the CW mode. At the 12-h post-embolization treatment time, neither the CW nor the P1 regimens resulted in statistically significant effect, although there was a trend for an improvement. The results show that P mode NILT can result in significant clinical improvement when administered 6 h following embolic strokes in rabbits and should be considered for clinical development.",Excluded

At the time of diagnosis, the mean tumor depth was 3.7 mm (+/-SD:1.6 mm). The mean dose at the tumor apex was 141.4 Gy (+/- SD: 12.1 Gy) and 557.7 Gy (+/- SD: 257.3 Gy) to the sclera.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 69.5 months (+/- SD: 53.8 months). Thirty-four patients (87.1%) remained free of recurrence. Twenty-six patients (66.7%) demonstrated a complete tumor regression after a median period of 12 months (3-60 mon.). By the final examination, the visual acuity of 26 patients (66.7%) was better than 20/200, and 12 patients (30.7%) had a visual acuity better than 20/40. Retinopathy was detected in 11 patients (28.2%). After treatments only one patient (5.1%) had active vascular changes by the last examination. Moderate optic neuropathy was observed in 4 patients (10.3%). Cataract development was diagnosed in 21 patients (53.8%), and 16 patients (41%) had bilateral cataract development.

2158,"Lipid alteration following proton beam irradiation in mouse brain of radiation necrosis model INTRODUCTION: Brain radiation necrosis (RN) is irreversible severe adverse effect after radiation therapy for brain tumors over 60 Gy. Effective treatment for this irreversible event has not been established. The lying mechanism of RN is to be elucidated in order to establish a new therapy. We have established brain RN mouse model using proton beam at the Wakasa Wan Energy research Center. In this model, RN was induced 8 months after irradiation and the histology of the necrosis recapitulated the human RN patients [Kondo N.2015]. So far, some researchers investigated the mechanism of RN based on protein level. However, with the advanced mass spectrometry technology, lipid mediator response to ionizing radiation was reported [Laiakis EC, 2014]. Therefore, in this study, lipid alteration after proton beam irradiation was investigated in mouse brain RN model using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizing imaging mass spectrometry (HR-MALDI-IMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generation of mouse brain RN model: C57BL/6J mice were irradiated in the restricted area of right brain at 60 Gy using proton beam. Tissue preparation: After 4 months later mouse was sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with cold PBS. The brain was extracted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in-80degreeC. The brain was sliced to a thickness of 4 mum with a cryostat and placed onto an indium tin oxide coated glass slide and stored at-20 degreeC until matrix application and subsequent HR-MALDI-IMS analysis. Each slide was anchored in vacuum deposition equipment and coated with 9-aminoacridine hemihydrates (9-AA) matrix layer obtained by sublimation at 220degreeC. The sequential sections were mounted onto glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis: HR-MALDI-IMS analysis was performed on a high-resolution microscopic imaging mass spectrometer (iMScope; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry data were acquired in negative and positive mode in the mass range of m/z 700-1000. Statistical Analysis: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed by Imaging MS Solution (ver 1, 12, 26; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). RESULT(S): Compared to non-irradiated area, in the irradiated right hemisphere, i) elevation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (34:1, 36:4, 36:1, 38:6, 40:6) and ii) decline of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (36:4, 38:4) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): The data indicated the phospholipid alterations after irradiation in mouse brain RN model in the chronic phase before establishment of RN. Further analysis for component of these phospholipids may include the precursor of lipid mediator, arachidonic acid (AA) or other fatty acids. We will investigate time-dependent change of phospholipids using mouse brain RN model and HR-MALDI-IMS analysis then finally find the responsible lipid mediators which induce brain RN.",Included

Part II: Adjuvant radiobiological tools Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is currently a well-established, minimally invasive treatment for many primary and secondary tumors, especially deep-sited lesions for which traditional neurosurgical procedures were poorly satisfactory or not effective at all. The initial evolution of SRS was cautious, relying on more than 30 years of experimental and clinical work that preceded its introduction into the worldwide medical community. This path enabled a brilliant present, and the continuous pace of technological advancement holds promise for a brighter future.

1702,"Radiotherapy and immunotherapy converge on elimination of tumor-promoting erythroid progenitor cells through adaptive immunity Tumor-induced CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>+</sup>CD71<sup>+</sup> erythroid progenitor cells, termed ""Ter cells,"" promote tumor progression by secreting artemin (ARTN), a neurotrophic peptide that activates REarranged during Transfection (RET) signaling. We demonstrate that both local tumor ionizing radiation (IR) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment decreased tumor-induced Ter cell abundance in the mouse spleen and ARTN secretion outside the irradiation field in an interferon- and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent manner. Recombinant erythropoietin promoted resistance to radiotherapy or anti-PD-L1 therapies by restoring Ter cell numbers and serum ARTN concentration. Blockade of ARTN or potential ARTN signaling partners, or depletion of Ter cells augmented the antitumor effects of both IR and anti-PD-L1 therapies in mice. Analysis of samples from patients who received radioimmunotherapy demonstrated that IR-mediated reduction of Ter cells, ARTN, and GFRalpha3, an ARTN signaling partner, were each associated with tumor regression. Patients with melanoma who received immunotherapy exhibited favorable outcomes associated with decreased expression of GFRalpha3. These findings demonstrate an out-of-field, or ""abscopal,"" effect mediated by adaptive immunity, which is induced during local tumor irradiation. This effect, in turn, governs the therapeutic effects of radiation and immunotherapy. Therefore, our results identify multiple targets to potentially improve outcomes after radiotherapy and immunotherapy.",Excluded

1348,"Enhancement of dosimetric optimization for stereotactic radiosurgery. [French] Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps - from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: 'What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?'. The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator.",Excluded

The XP90TO and XP92TO fibroblasts exhibited the typical XPF characteristics of a threefold higher sensitivity to the lethal effect of 254 nm UV and a reduced level of 12% unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) compared with normal cells. Clinically, both patients manifested moderate to severe acute sun sensitivity by age 8, pigmented freckles by age 10 and skin malignancies at higher ages (6 basaliomas at 42 years in XP90TO; 1 basalioma at 41 years in XP92TO). Despite the still currently sun-sensitive state, the patients showed normal minimal erythema dose (MED) at monochromatic wavelengths of 290, 300 and 305 nm but abnormally delayed peaking of erythema reaction at 48 h after exposure. After irradiation with more than 3 MED, XP92TO showed a long persistence of induced erythema for at least 7 days. A review of the 16 reported XPF patients indicated mild skin manifestations, no neurological abnormalities, and more delayed skin carcinogenesis at a lower frequency than that in XPA patients.

1229,"Therapeutic potential of chlorotoxin-like neurotoxin from the Chinese scorpion for human gliomas Chlorotoxin, one of the key toxins in scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus venom, has been shown to bind specifically to glioma cell surface as a specific chloride channel blocker. In this study, a purified, recombinant chlorotoxin-like peptide from the scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch (named rBmK CTa) was characterized by in vivo and in vitro studies. The results from cell proliferation assay with human glioma (SHG-44) cells showed that rBmK CTa inhibits the growth of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of approximately 0.28microM. Under the same conditions, the IC(50) value for normal astrocytes increased to 8microM. This clearly indicated that rBmK CTa had specific toxicity against glioma cells but not astrocytes. Results from whole-cell patch-clamp recording showed that chloride current in SHG-44 was inhibited by rBmK CTa in a voltage-dependent manner and percent inhibitions for the blocking action of rBmK CTa (0.07 and 0.14microM) on I(Cl) was 17.64+/-3.06% and 55.86+/-2.83%, respectively. Histological analysis of rBmK CTa treated mice showed that brain, leg muscle and cardiac muscle were the target organs of this toxin.

1630,"Characterization of Na+-activated K+ currents in larval lamprey spinal cord neurons Potassium channels play an important role in controlling neuronal firing and synaptic interactions. Na(+)-activated K(+) (K(Na)) channels have been shown to exist in neurons in different regions of the CNS, but their physiological function has been difficult to assess. In this study, we have examined if neurons in the spinal cord possess K(Na) currents. We used whole cell recordings from isolated spinal cord neurons in lamprey. These neurons display two different K(Na) currents. The first was transient and activated by the Na(+) influx during the action potentials, and it was abolished when Na(+) channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin. The second K(Na) current was sustained and persisted in tetrodotoxin. Both K(Na) currents were abolished when Na(+) was substituted with choline or N-methyl-D-glucamine, indicating that they are indeed dependent on Na(+) influx into neurons. When Na(+) was substituted with Li(+), the amplitude of the inward current was unchanged, whereas the transient K(Na) current was reduced but not abolished. This suggests that the transient K(Na) current is partially activated by Li(+). These two K(Na) currents have different roles in controlling the action potential waveform. The transient K(Na) appears to act as a negative feedback mechanism sensing the Na(+) influx underlying the action potential and may thus be critical for setting the amplitude and duration of the action potential. The sustained K(Na) current has a slow kinetic of activation and may underlie the slow Ca(2+)-independent afterhyperpolarization mediated by repetitive firing in lamprey spinal cord neurons.",Excluded

The authors previously developed an image-based two-compartment method for BM dosimetry, showing a significant correlation between absorbed dose to BM and hematological toxicity in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments. In the present study, they aimed to further evaluate this BM dosimetry method by finding optimal settings for dividing the whole body into two compartments; in terms of minimizing the coefficient of variation (CV) for the individual absorbed doses and studying its correlation to the BM response. The authors have also added specific absorbed fractions for male and female. Finally, they compare this two-compartment method with whole-body dosimetry.METHODS: This study included 46 patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE on two to five occasions at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Planar gamma camera images were collected at four time points postinjection, and a segmentation tool using a normalized number of uptake foci (nNUF) to divide the whole body into high- and low-uptake compartments was used. The authors characterized the two-compartment model and compared it with whole-body dosimetry.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The dosimetry method was robust, with an optimal nNUF value of 0.1-0.2. Using an nNUF value of 0.15, the absorbed BM dose was estimated as 0.20 Gy/7.4 GBq, and the CV as 8.4%.

The change of tumor burden after treatment can be related with prognosis, the change of TNM stage may influence the outcome of treatment. We investigated the impact of downstaging on overall survival (OS) in LD-SCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the 210 LD-SCLC patients, who were treated with CRT at Seoul National University Hospital from Apr 1999 to Nov 2012. The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and subgroup analysis on the responders was performed. Result(s): Patients showing CR, partial remission (PR), and stable disease (SD)/progressive disease (PD) were 37.1% (n=78), 46.2% (n=97), and 16.7% (n=35), respectively. The median OS for CR, PR, and SD/PD were 47.9 months (mo), 21.8 mo, and 11.2 mo, respectively (P <0.001). Patients showing downstaging and no change/upstaging were 61.5% (n=129) and 38.5% (n=81), respectively. The median OS for downstaging and no change/upstaging were 36.5 mo and 14.4 mo, respectively (P <0.001). Among the 97 patients achieving PR, OS were statistically differed by downstaging (26.0 mo in patients with downstaging and 17.7 mo in patients without downstaging [P =0.021]). In the multivariate analyses, female, downstaging, lower initial TNM stage, and prophylactic cranial irradiation were independent good prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): Downstaging was independent prognostic factor in LD-SCLC. Especially, downstaging is useful for further stratification of patients achieving PR.

No prior chest imaging was available. Patient was discharged after appendectomy and was advised to have follow up imaging, but was thereafter lost to follow up. Two years later patient presented with productive cough and scant hemoptysis. A CTscan of the chest then revealed a 6.7 cm lung mass. Carcinoid tumor was suspected but octreotide scan was negative. A CT guided lung biopsy revealed adeno-carcinoma positive for EGFR mutation. Three weeks later patient was admitted with headache and right arm weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed left sided metastases in parietal and occipital lobe, confirming stage IV disease IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Risk of a lung nodule being malignant depends on size, consistency and patient risk factors. The risk of malignancy in a nodule of 5 mm is < 1 %, 5-9 mm is 2-6%, 8-20 mm is 18% and > 20 mm is 50%. Solid nodules are at greater risk than semi solid and ground glass nodules. Significant risk factors include cigarette smoking, age> 35 years, female gender, exposure to radiation or environmental toxins, pulmonary fibrosis, alcohol consumption and positive family history. According to Fleischner society guidelines a lung nodule > 8 mm should be either resected for biopsy in patients with risk factors for lung cancer, or followed up with CT chest in 3 months in low risk patients. In patients under 35 years old with no risk factors, the chance of a lung nodule proving to be malignant is < 3%. It has also been noted that patients with nodules between 8-30 mm and concern of poor follow up (due to socioeconomic status, psychological issues, young age) should undergo either non-surgical biopsy or video assisted thoracoscopic surgery with wedge resection. Lung adenocarcinoma commonly presents as a pulmonary nodule. 5 year survival rate of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma is < 10 % while for stage I it is 60-80%. The patient in this case presented 2 years after the finding of an incidental nodule with cancer that had progressed to stage IV. We suggest that timely intervention with biopsy of the nodule on first presentation could have altered this course. Conclusion(s): Guidelines should be used in the proper clinical context as a tool to help in patient management as exceptions always exist. In any patient, including young patients with no risk factors for lung cancer presenting with nodules > 8 mm in size, there should be significant clinical suspicion of malignancy.

No complications relating to radiation exposure, contrast medium use, or IVR procedures were observed. CT perfusion was useful for detecting cerebral perfusion impairment during IVR procedures. This was helpful in deciding the postoperative management. Because patients do not need to be transported to another radiographic suite to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion, the IVR-CT/angio system is ideal for safely and simply detecting cerebral perfusion defects during IVR procedures. However, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient indication for the procedure, because radiation exposure and the amount of contrast medium use are increased if the IVR procedures become difficult.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): From November 1994 to September 1996, 25 lesions in 20 patients with clinical and/or imaging evidence of malignant glioma persistence or recurrence received salvage H-SRT, Nineteen patients at the time of initial diagnosis had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and one patient had an anaplastic astrocytoma. All of these patients with tumor persistence or recurrence had received initial fractionated radiation therapy (RT) with a mean and median dose of 60 Gy (44.0-72.0 Gy). The median time from completion of initial RT to H-SRT was 3.1 months (0.7-45.5 months). Salvage H-SRT was delivered using daily 3.0- 3.5 Gy fractions (fxs). Three different total dose levels were sequentially evaluated: 24.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (five lesions), 30.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (10 lesions), and 35.0 Gy/3.5 Gy fxs (nine lesions). Median treated tumor volume measured 12.66 cc (0.89-47.5 cc). The median ratio of prescription volume to tumor volume was 2,8 (1.4-5.0). Toxicity was judged by RTOG criteria. Response was determined by clinical neurologic improvement, a decrease in steroid dose without clinical deterioration, and/or radiologic imaging. Result(s): No grade 3 toxicities were observed and no reoperation due to toxicity was required. At the time of analysis, 13 of 20 patients had died. The median survival time from the completion of H-SRT is 10.5 months with a 1-year survival rate of 20%. Neurological improvement was found in 45% of patients. Decreased steroid requirements occurred in 60% of patients. Minor imaging response was noted in 22% of patients. Using Fisher's exact test, response of any kind correlated strongly to total dose (p = 0.0056). None of six lesions treated with 21 Gy or 24 Gy responded, whereas there was a 79% response rate among the 19 lesions treated with 30 or 35 Gy. Tumor volumes <=20 cc were associated with a higher likelihood of response (p = 0.053). Conclusion(s): H-SRT used in this cohort of previously irradiated patients with malignant glioma was not associated with the need for reoperation due to toxicity or grade 3 toxicity. This low toxicity profile and encouraging H- SRT dose-related response outcome justifies further evaluation and dose escalation.",Excluded

At resonance, for E along the long dimension (a), a power deposition nine times higher than that for the H parallel a orientation is observed. For rats in the k parallel a configuration, the frequencies of peak absorption and the maximum absorption at these values demonstrate W-1/3 and W 2/3 dependencies, respectively, upon the weight W of the animal.

For such lesions, the authors adopted a procedure in which stereotactic aspiration is first performed and followed immediately by GKS on the same day. In this paper, the authors describe this 1-day combined procedure and evaluate its efficacy.METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 25 cystic metastases in 25 patients were treated at Dokkyo Medical University. The patients first underwent MRI and stereotactic aspiration of the cyst while stationary in a Leksell stereotactic frame; immediately afterward, the patients underwent a second MR imaging session and Gamma Knife treatment. Tumor volume reduction, tumor control rate, and overall survival were examined.RESULTS: Tumor volume, including the cystic component, decreased from 8.0-64.2 cm(3) (mean 20.3 cm(3)) to 3.0-36.2 cm(3) (mean 10.3 cm(3)) following aspiration, and the volume of 24 of 25 lesions decreased to less than 16.6 cm(3), which is equivalent to the volume of a 3.16-cm sphere. At least 20 Gy was delivered to the entire lesion in 24 of 25 cases. Good tumor control was obtained in 16 of 21 cases that could be evaluated during a median follow-up period of 11 months (range 1-27 months); however, reaccumulation of cyst contents was observed in 2 patients who required Ommaya reservoir placement.CONCLUSIONS: The 1-day aspiration plus GKS procedure is an effective and time-efficient treatment for large cystic brain metastases.",Excluded
2059,"Radiosurgery for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas - Indications for limitations for gamma knife treatment. [Japanese] We summarize the results of gamma knife treatment for dural arterivenous fistula (DAVF), are report our study. Since the early 1990s, DAVFs have been treated in the same manner as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), i.e., by radiosurgery, performed with or without embolization. DAVFs in the cavernous sinus, transverse-sigmoid sinus, and cerebellar tent were treated with a marginal dose of 18 to 20 Gy. The current obliteration rates of DAVF reported in literature are not low when compared with those of AVM. Excellent DAVF obliteration rates were observed in our study, which were similar to those reported in the literature. In fact, complete response (CR) was observed in 9 cases, partial response (PR) in 9 cases, and partical obliteration in 6 cases during the mean follow-up of 27 months. Moreover, considerable neurological improvements were noted, which apparently began at an early stage post radiosurgery. Bleeding was observed 2 cases associated with cortical reflux during the follow-up. In conclusion, radiosurgery for DAVF is very useful for both the obliteration of the fistula and for the improvement of clinical signs. However, prior to performing radiosurgery, the lesions with cortical reflux should be interrupted by initially treated with surgery or embolization.",Excluded
2024,"Effect of cell-mediated immune factors on the replication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive mutant of vaccinia virus Studies of the in vivo multiplication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive strain of vaccinia virus (ts2) indicated that temperature sensitivity alone could not account for the attenuation. Immunodepressive treatment of intracerebrally inoculated mice had a dramatic stimulatory effect on the multiplication of the attenuated strain and suggested that establishment of ts2 infection in the mice was hindered by host defense mechanisms mediated by cellular elements. Experiments carried out in vitro with the 51Cr release assay showed that cells infected with the ts2 mutant represented more susceptible targets to the cytotoxic action of immune spleen cells than cells infected with the parent vaccinia strain. Moreover, it appeared that ts2 replication, compared with wild-type replication in vitro, was more inhibited by the immune spleen cells. Although this work did not evaluate the role of specifically sensitized lymphocytes within the lesions, indirect evidence suggests that lymphocytes could cause a more effective halt in ts2 virus multiplication than in wild-type multiplication.",Excluded

2473,"Endothelial apoptosis initiates acute blood-brain barrier disruption after ionizing radiation Acute disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well recognized after radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed the genetic regulation of acute BBB disruption and its relationship to vascular endothelial cell death in the CNS after irradiation. Adult rats were given graded single doses of X-ray to the cervical spinal cord. At different time intervals after irradiation, the irradiated spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier was assessed using albumin immunohistochemistry, i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. In the rat spinal cord, there was a dose-dependent apoptotic response during the first 24 h after irradiation, and apoptotic cells consisted of both endothelial and glial cells, as described previously (1, 2). A dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell density was observed at 24 h after irradiation. This was associated with a similar dose-dependent disruption in blood-spinal cord barrier as demonstrated by albumin immunohistochemistry. Radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells has been shown to be dependent on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. After a single 50-Gy dose to the cervical spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was a 47.7% reduction in endothelial cell density at 24 h compared with nonirradiated controls. No decrease in endothelial cell density was observed in irradiated ASMase -/- mice. In the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was evidence of albumin immunoreactivity and Evans blue dye staining around microvessels, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake increased at 24 h. Nonirradiated controls and the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase -/- mice demonstrated no evidence of leakage. We conclude that apoptosis of endothelial cells initiates acute BBB disruption in the CNS after irradiation and that acute BBB disruption after irradiation is mediated by the ASMase pathway.",Included
2041,"Radiation as a local ablative therapy option for oligoprogressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with osimertinib Purpose/Objective(s): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved response rate and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their efficacy is limited by acquired resistance and disease progression. Local ablative therapy (LAT) has shown a survival benefit in patients with oligometastatic disease in retrospective studies. At our institution, we are conducting a prospective single-arm Phase 2 study of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI. Following LAT to the sites of progression with either radiation or surgery, patients are re-initiated on osimertinib. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and efficacy of re-initiation of osimertinib, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that osimertinib and radiation can be safely administered sequentially, and that LAT followed by re-initiation of osimertinib will result in improved PFS. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with no prior EGFR-TKI exposure (cohort 1) or progression after 1st/2nd generation EGFR-TKIs with acquired T790M mutation (cohort 2) receive osimertinib. Upon progression, eligible patients with <=5 progressing sites undergo LAT by either radiation therapy or surgery, then resume osimertinib until further disease progression. Patients previously treated with osimertinib with disease progression who qualify for LAT are also eligible (cohort 3). Prior to beginning radiation, patients must be off osimertinib for at least 2 wks, and total time off osimertinib must be less than 8 wks. Result(s): Fifteen patients with a median age of 57 (range 36-71) were enrolled between 4/2016 and 1/2017 (cohorts 1/2/3: 9/3/3 patients). Overall, treatment has been well tolerated, with rash, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and alanine transaminase elevation the most common adverse events (AEs). Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 4 (27%) patients. Objective response rates among evaluable patients prior to LAT in cohorts 1 and 2 were 71% (5/7) and 100% (2/2), respectively. Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI: 3.4 mo-undefined) in cohort 1; there have been no progressions in cohort 2. To date, 2/5 patients receiving LAT have received radiation (both in cohort 3). One patient received 5 Gy x 5 to 2 lung lesions, while the other received 24 Gy and 18 Gy by stereotactic radiosurgery to 2 brain metastases. Additional endpoints include assessment of mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib by multi-omics analyses of tumor, blood, and saliva; results from these analyses will also be presented. Conclusion(s): Oligoprogressive disease can be safely treated with LAT, including radiation therapy, in patients with limited metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR-TKI therapy. This approach could potentially prevent premature switching to other, less-effective systemic therapies by maximizing the duration and efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment in selected patients.",Excluded
1625,"Behavioral effects in mice of postnatal exposure to low-doses of 137-cesium and bisphenol A Bisphenol A (BPA) is the most important plasticizer used in many household products such as polycarbonate plastics or epoxy resins. Public and scientific concerns exist regarding the possibility that the neonatal exposure to BPA may contribute to neurobehavioral disorders. On the other hand, there is little information on the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation during critical phases of postnatal brain development, as well as the combination of radiation and environmental chemicals. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to low doses of internal radiation ((137)Cs), and/or BPA on postnatal day 10 (PND10). At the age of two months, animals were submitted to several tests to assess anxiety, activity, learning, and memory. Results showed that exposure to (137)Cs, alone or in combination with BPA, increased the anxiety-like of the animals without changing the activity levels. Animals exposed to (137)Cs showed impaired learning, and spatial memory, an impairment that was not observed in the groups co-exposed to BPA.",Excluded
1420,"Radiotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases: effects of activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations on clinical response PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been applied to inoperable brain metastases in lung adenocarcinoma. Recently, an in vitro study showed reduced clonogenic survival of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) lung cancer cell lines in response to ionizing radiation compared with that of the wild type. To elucidate the role of EGFR mutations in radiation treatment, we evaluated the clinical response to WBRT and survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma who were treated with WBRT. Demographic data, EGFR mutation status, response to WBRT, and survival data were collected. Clinical response was assessed 1 month after the start of WBRT. Univariate and logistic regression models were used to test potential predictive factors associated with clinical response. Log-rank test and Cox regression were analyzed to identify factors that affected survival.RESULTS: Clinical response to WBRT was observed in 29 patients (46%), with 34 nonresponder patients (54%). Patients with EGFR mutations had higher response rates to WBRT compared with those with the wild-type (54% versus 24%; P = 0.045). Both the administration of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (P = 0.034) and EGFR mutation (P = 0.029) were independently associated with response to WBRT. In Cox regression analysis, WBRT responder (P = 0.010) and absence of extracranial metastases (P = 0.002) were associated with better survival.CONCLUSIONS: Both the EGFR mutations and the administration of EGFR TKI during WBRT were independent predictors of response to WBRT in brain metastases of lung adenocarcinoma.",Excluded
1935,"Radiation dose reduction using real-time image processing in interventional radiology Purpose: To characterize changes in radiation dose after introducing a new real-time image processing technology in interventional radiology systems. Method(s): Interventional radiology (IR) procedures are increasingly complex, at times requiring substantial time and radiation dose. The risk of inducing tissue reactions as well as long-term stochastic effects such as radiation-induced cancer is not trivial. To reduce this risk, IR systems are increasingly equipped with dose reduction technologies. Recently, ClarityIQ (Philips Healthcare) technology was installed in our existing neuroradiology IR (NIR) and vascular IR (VIR) suites respectively. ClarityIQ includes realtime image processing that reduces noise/artifacts, enhances images, and sharpens edges while also reducing radiation dose rates. We reviewed 412 NIR (175 pre-and 237 post-ClarityIQ) procedures and 329 VIR (156 preand 173 post-ClarityIQ) procedures performed at our institution pre-and post-ClarityIQ implementation. NIR procedures were primarily classified as interventional or diagnostic. VIR procedures included drain port, drain placement, tube change, mesenteric, and implanted venous procedures. Air Kerma (AK in units of mGy) was documented for all the cases using a commercial radiation exposure management system. Result(s): When considering all NIR procedures, median AK decreased from 1194 mGy to 561 mGy. When considering all VIR procedures, median AK decreased from 49 to 14 mGy. Both NIR and VIR exhibited a decrease in AK exceeding 50% after ClarityIQ implementation, a statistically significant (p<0.05) difference. Of the 5 most common VIR procedures, all median AK values decreased, but significance (p<0.05) was only reached in venous access (N=53), angio mesenteric (N=41), and drain placement procedures (N=31). Conclusion(s): ClarityIQ can reduce dose significantly for both NIR and VIR procedures. Image quality was not assessed in conjunction with the dose reduction.",Excluded

1844,"Textiloma mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma Introduction: Textiloma (Txm) is defined as a foreign body-related inflammatory pseudotumor arising from retained nonabsorbable cotton matrix with the associated inflammatory reaction. In current neurosurgical practice, Txm often refers to a resorbable hemostatic agent that is intentionally left in place to prevent the potentially disastrous consequences of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage. Imaging is essential to the workup for Txm, but it cannot be easily distinguished from a recurrent tumor or abscess due to their nonspecific characteristics. Parameter calculations of diffusion weighted imaging are based on complex pharmacokinetic compartment models that allow only an approximation of the biological conditions. This report describes a case of a Txm mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma including altered advanced neuroimaging techniques in an effort to highlight this possibility in the setting of tumoral recurrence. Materials And Methods: A 69-year-old female presented to our facility with a 6-month history of progressive left-sided weakness. Neuroimaging studies revealed a large non-enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal lobe. Pathology reported a diffuse astrocytoma, WHO grade II with wildtype IDH-1, EGFR amplification and PTEN negative results. After surgical intervention, external beam radiation was given to the remaining areas of residual tumor. Routine MRI revealed a nodular area of contrast enhancement in the dorsal and inferior margin of the biopsy tract, growing between interval scans, perfusion-weighted imaging parameters were elevated, clinically asymptomatic. Result(s): She underwent a complete resection of this area of interest and pathology returned as a Txm with surgicel fibers. Reactive changes were also seen consistent with radiation effect and areas of atypical cells consistent with residual tumor but not significantly mitotically active. She did notrequire any further treatments and was on observation with imaging only for 14 months until another area of progression was seen. Conclusion(s): After treatment of a neoplasm, if unexpected clinical or imaging evidence of recurrence is present, it may be a foreign body reaction to hemostatic material used during the initial surgery. The implications of this case lie in recognizing this entity to avoid unnecessary procedures. Given the technical variability of advanced MRI techniques, there are limits to the sensitivity and specificity of such. The standardization of advanced MRI is well recognized as a pressing clinical and research need.",Excluded

Presumptive diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging. SRT was delivered in 3 dose fractions of 8 Gray (Gy) on consecutive days or every other day to a total dose of 24 Gy.RESULTS: Median disease-specific survival was 745 days (range: 99-1375 days, n = 6). No signs of acute adverse effects of radiation treatment were recorded. Late radiation effects versus tumor progression could not be confirmed histopathologically because of few animals undergoing necropsy.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study provides preliminary evidence that dogs with PNST benefit from SRT in terms of long-term survival. The treatment appears to be well tolerated and requires fewer anesthetic events for animals compared to full-course radiation.",Excluded

Our aim was to estimate the radiation dose of <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 in human, and then compare the clinical radiation dosimetry results to estimations in previously published preclinical data. Method(s): Serial whole body PET/CT imaging was performed over 240 min on 7 healthy volunteers after injection of 377+/-18.6 MBq (range, 340.7 - 388.9 MBq) of <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351. The bladder and gallbladder were delineated from PET images, and other organs were delineated on CT images. Voided urine activity was recorded. The decay-corrected and normalized <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 activity of 15 source organ regions as a function of time was entered into the OLINDA/EXM software to calculate the effective dose of each subject following the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema. Result(s): <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 injection was well tolerated.

1511,"Prospective evaluation of relationships between radiotherapy dose to masticatory apparatus and trismus AIMS: This feasibility study aimed to identify relationships between radiation doses to the masticatory apparatus as a combined block or as individual subunits with changes in trismus following radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients from a single center were recruited prospectively as part of a randomized trial comparing proactive exercises in the management of trismus. Patients with stage III/IV oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers received intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent systemic therapy. All patients had trismus prior to radiotherapy. Maximal inter-incisor distance (MID) was measured pre- and 6 months from the start of radiotherapy. Bilateral muscles of mastication: medial and lateral pterygoids (MP and LP), masseters (M), temporalis (T), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were contoured on CT images. The block comprised all muscles excluding the TMJ below the orbital floor. Mean dose, equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and V35-V60 Gy were compared with change in MID.RESULTS: In six patients, the MID deteriorated at 6 months from the start of radiotherapy compared with 14 whose MID improved. No significant association was observed between age, gender, smoking, alcohol status, exercise compliance, cisplatin, tumor site, stage, V35-V60 Gy or EUD with change in MID. A clinical outlier was excluded. Without the outlier (n = 19), a significant association was seen between mean dose and change in MID at 6 months for the ipsilateral block (p = .01), LP (p = .04) and M (p < .01). All patients where trismus deteriorated at 6 months received mean doses >40 Gy to the block.CONCLUSION: Higher mean radiation doses to the ipsilateral block, LP and M were significantly associated with deterioration in trismus. Limiting dose to these structures to <=40 Gy for tumors not invading the masticatory muscles may improve treatment-related sequelae. The ipsilateral block, LP and M should be studied further as possible alternative avoidance structures in radiotherapy treatment planning.",Excluded
1629,"Requirement for Atm in ionizing radiation-induced cell death in the developing central nervous system Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that results from mutation of the ATM gene. However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-/- mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm-/- mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system. Atm may function at a developmental survival checkpoint that serves to eliminate neurons with excessive DNA damage.",Included
2040,"Crosstalk of ERBB2 with lef1 regulates jagged1-mediated radioresistance in glioblastoma ErbB2 (Her2) belongs to the family of EGF receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a vital oncogenic role in several cancers. Gliomas are reported to have aberrant overexpression of ErbB2, but its role in glioma biology and treatment resistance have not been well studied. We have previously reported that ionizing radiation (IR) increases cell invasiveness and radioresistance. In our preliminary studies, we observed that shRNA mediated ErbB2 silencing in glioma cell lines resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and invasion which was associated with a suppression of Notch signaling. To examine its role in radioresistance, we treated glioma cells with IR and observed that the cells exhibited a significant increase in invasiveness associated with nuclear translocation of ErbB2 and transcriptional upregulation of the Notch receptor ligand, Jagged-1. To further investigate the relationship between ErbB2 translocation and Notch signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation and transcription factor binding array studies in IR-treated cells which revealed an interesting association of nuclear ErbB2 with the TCF1/ LEF1 complex that is known to transcriptionally regulate Jagged-1 expression. In addition, chromatin-binding assays showed recruitment of ErbB2 to putative LEF1 consensus sites of the Jagged-1 promoter, suggesting a potential role for ErbB2 in the transcriptional regulation of Jagged-1 and consequently of Notch signaling after radiation in glioma cells. Further, downregulation of ErbB2 inhibited Notch signaling and decreased IR-induced invasion in these cells. These in vitro findings were further validated in an orthotopic intracranial glioma model that showed significant growth inhibition of intracranial ErbB2. shRNA-tumors compared to controls. Our results suggest a novel role for nuclear ErbB2 in regulating Jagged1/Notch1-signaling mediated cell invasion in IR treated cells, and provide a potential strategy for targeting ErbB2-mediated Notch signaling to overcome radioresistance in gliomas.",Excluded

Clinical, biochemical, and microscopic and ultramicroscopic studies were performed. An open-label trial of capsaicin cream application was initiated in 15 patients.RESULTS: An almost equal number of men and women were seen with an average age of 44 years. Brown-eyed and blue-eyed patients were seen with equal frequency. Most patients (86%) had outdoor occupations or avocations. The pruritus was intense, usually bilateral (72%) and invariably affected the lateral (as opposed to medial) aspects of the arm(s) in the absence of primary lesions. The most commonly affected area was the elbow area superficial to the brachioradialis and extensor carpi longus muscles, but extension of the pruritus to include the forearm and/or upper arm was common. Biopsy specimens (stained with hematoxylin and eosin) were normal or showed mild actinic elastosis in 15 patients tested. Ultramicroscopy showed myelin sheath splitting in all four patients studied. This is a nonspecific finding that may also be found in diabetic or alcoholic neuropathy. Ten of thirteen patients completing the capsaicin-cream study found significant relief (itching much improved or gone) after 3 weeks compared with the untreated control arm.CONCLUSIONS: The cause of solar pruritus remains unknown, but circumstantial evidence implicates chronic exposure to solar radiation. Capsaicin may offer relief to these patients, but the patients need to be cautioned about the burning sensation that occurs with capsaicin cream.",Excluded

Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.",Included
2347,"Magnetic resonance imaging of implanted deep brain stimulators: Experience in a large series Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly used and important imaging modality to evaluate lead location and rule out complications after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Recent safety concerns have prompted new safety recommendations for the use of MRI in these patients, including a new recommendation to limit the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the MRI sequences used to less than 0.1 W/kg. Following SAR recommendations in real-world situations is problematic for a variety of reasons. We review our experience scanning patients with implanted DBS systems over a 7-year period using a variety of scanning techniques and four scanning platforms. 405 patients with 746 implanted DBS systems were imaged using 1.5-tesla MRI with an SAR of up to 3 W/kg. Many of the DBS systems were imaged multiple times, for a total of 1,071 MRI events in this group of patients with no adverse events. This series strongly suggests that the 0.1 W/kg recommendation for SAR may be unnecessarily low for the prevention of MRI-related adverse events. Copyright © 2007 S. Karger AG.",Excluded

Thus, the neurologic outcome of radiosurgery in brain metastasis (BM) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was reviewed. We analyzed 135 patients with BM of NSCLC who were administered Cyberknife radiosurgery (CKRS) as either initial or salvage therapy. We evaluated local failure (LF), intracranial failure (IF), and neurological death (ND) due to BM. Primary outcome was neurological death-free survival (NDFS). Median follow-up was 16.2 months. Median CKRS dose of 22 Gy was administered to median 2 targets per patient. Among 99 deaths, 14 (14%) were ND. Upfront treatment for BM included CKRS alone in 85 patients (63%), CKRS + TA in 26 patients (19%), and WBRT in 24 patients (18%). No patients or tumor related factors were associated with ND. However, the type of upfront treatment for BM was significantly associated with ND [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.57) for CKRS + TA, HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for CKRS alone] compared with the WBRT group (P = 0.01). The 2-year NDFS rates for the CKRS + TA, CRKS alone, and WBRT groups were 94%, 87%, and 78%, respectively (P = 0.03). Upfront CKRS showed significantly higher 2-year LF-free survival rate (P < 0.01).

Circadian clocks and sleep evolved to adapt to Earth's environment, which is characterized by a 24-hour light-dark cycle. Changes in gravity load, lighting and work schedules during spaceflight missions can impact circadian clocks and disrupt sleep, in turn jeopardizing the mood, cognition and performance of orbiting astronauts. In this review, we summarize our understanding of both the influence of the space environment on the circadian timing system and sleep and the impact of these changes on astronaut physiology and performance.",Excluded
2342,"Gamma knife treatment for symptomatic epilepsy due to vascular malformations Introduction: Detailed prospective studies are scarce on gamma knife treatment for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or cavernous angioma (CA) regarding epilepsy outcome. The objective of this study is to further investigate prospectively the effect of gamma knife on seizures and expand our knowledge to other aspects of epilepsy management: medication, cognition and quality of life. Method(s): We included prospectively 9 consecutive patients (4 AVM and 5 CA) who underwent radiosurgery for epilepsy caused by vascular malformation at the CHUS between August 2004 and August 2009. The mean marginal radiation dose was 20 Gy. The objective of this study is to determinate the seizure outcome after radiosurgery. Patients were followed every 3 months to evaluate seizure count over time, Engel score and medication status. Quality of life (QOLIE 89) and neuropsychological evaluation were completed before the treatment and at 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Result(s): Patients were followed for a mean period of 39 months (range from 15 to 72 months). Three patients have been seizure free for 1 year (33%). Overall 5 patients (55%) had significant improvement with an Engel score of 1 (completely seizure free or non disabling simple partial seizure only). Medication status did not change over time. The QOLIE 89 score improved by more than 25 points (on a 100 points scale) in 3 patients (43%), 2 patients (29%) reported no change and 2 patients had lower scores. Neuropsychological testing did not show any deterioration in cognition following the intervention. No adverse reaction occurred so far. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery has some efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy associated with vascular malformations and improves quality of life in a majority of patients. It seems less effective than surgical lesionectomy. No cognitive or physical morbidity was observed. This treatment could be a useful alternative for vascular lesions in eloquent areas that cannot be safely removed with microsurgery.",Excluded
2388,"Initial Gamma Knife radiosurgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas OBJECT: Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and, when symptomatic, typically require surgical removal as an initial means of management. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients whose comorbidities substantially increase the risks of resection. In this report, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial GKRS for NFAs.METHODS: An international group of three academic Gamma Knife centers retrospectively reviewed outcome data in 569 patients with NFAs.RESULTS: Forty-one patients (7.2%) underwent GKRS as primary management for their NFAs because of an advanced age, multiple comorbidities, or patient preference. The median age at the time of radiosurgery was 69 years. Thirty-seven percent of the patients had hypopituitarism before GKRS. Patients received a median tumor margin dose of 12 Gy (range 6.2-25.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. The overall tumor control rate was 92.7%, and the actuarial tumor control rate was 94% and 85% at 5 and 10 years postradiosurgery, respectively. Three patients with tumor growth or symptom progression underwent resection at 3, 3, and 96 months after GKRS, respectively. New or worsened hypopituitarism developed in 10 patients (24%) at a median interval of 37 months after GKRS. One patient suffered new-onset cranial nerve palsy. No other radiosurgical complications were noted. Delayed hypopituitarism was observed more often in patients who had received a tumor margin dose > 18 Gy (p = 0.038) and a maximum dose > 36 Gy (p = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, GKRS resulted in long-term control of NFAs in 85% of patients at 10 years. This experience suggests that GKRS provides long-term tumor control with an acceptable risk profile. This approach may be especially valuable in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities, and those who have endocrine-inactive tumors without visual compromise due to mass effect of the adenoma.",Excluded

1505,"Defining the role of palliative radiotherapy in bone metastasis from primary liver cancer: An analysis of survival and treatment efficacy Aims and background. Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is still associated with a poor prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are known to cause bone metastasis resulting in pain, neurologic impairment and risk of fracture. Palliative radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in symptomatic bone lesions and is usually performed as percutaneous fractionated radiotherapy. Methods and study design. From June 1987 to December 2009, 41 patients (median age, 64 years) with bonemetastasis received radiotherapy in our department. The analyzed patients were treated for 67 sites of bone lesions. We analyzed the applied fractionation schedules and the preferred sites of metastasis and symptoms, evaluated the therapeutic outcome in terms of symptomatic improvement, and described the prognosis of these patients. Results. Main indication for palliative radiotherapy was pain in 94% of all cases.Most frequent radiation protocols were 10 x 3 Gy (20 patients) and 20 x 2 Gy (19 patients). Median applied overall dose was 39 Gy (range, 4-48 Gy) and median single dose was 2.5 Gy (range, 1.8-4 Gy). The median duration of the radiotherapeutic treatment was 15 days (range, 2-24 days) and in 12 cases treatment was discontinuated. The overall response rate to palliative radiotherapy in bone metastasis was 77%. Median overall survival in both cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma patients was 4.2 months after initiation of radiotherapy (range, 0.2-38.9). Conclusions. Considering the poor prognosis of patients with bone metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, with a poor median survival of 3.7-5.0 months according to our study and existing literature, shorter radiotherapy schedules or even single-fraction irradiation can be considered.",Excluded

1565,"Genome and hormones: Gender differences in physiology invited review: Gender issues related to spaceflight: A NASA perspective This minireview provides an overview of known and potential gender differences in physiological responses to spaceflight. The paper covers cardiovascular and exercise physiology, barophysiology and decompression sickness, renal stone risk, immunology, neurovestibular and sensorimotor function, nutrition, pharmacotherapeutics, and reproduction. Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about genderspecific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders. Individual characteristics usually outweigh gender differences per se.",Excluded
1745,"Electrophysiological characterisation of central sensitisation in canine spontaneous osteoarthritis In man, central sensitisation (CS) contributes to the pain of osteoarthritis (OA). Dogs with spontaneous OA may also exhibit CS. Electrophysiological reflex measurements are more objective than behavioural assessments and can be used to evaluate CS in preclinical and clinical studies. It was hypothesised that dogs suffering from OA would exhibit electrophysiological characteristics indicative of CS, associated with reduced diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs). One hundred and seventeen client-owned dogs were recruited to the study. Hind limb nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds, stimulus response, and temporal summation characteristics were recorded, during alfaxalone anaesthesia, from 46 OA dogs, 29 OA dogs receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OANSAIDs), and 27 breed- and weight-matched control dogs. Efficacy of DNIC was evaluated in 12 control and 11 of the OA dogs, by application of a mechanical conditioning stimulus to the contralateral forelimb. Nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds were higher in OA compared with control dogs (P = 0.02). Stimulus response characteristics demonstrated an augmented response in OANSAID dogs compared with OA (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001) dogs. Temporal summation demonstrated exaggerated C-fibre-mediated responses in both OA (P < 0.001) and OANSAID (P = 0.005) groups, compared with control animals. Conditioning stimulus application resulted in inhibition of test reflex responses in both OA and control animals (P < 0.001); control animals demonstrated greater inhibition compared with OA (P = 0.0499). These data provide evidence of neurophysiological changes consistent with CS in dogs with spontaneous OA and demonstrate that canine OA is associated with reduced DNIC.",Excluded
1995,"Fail-Safe Therapy by Gamma-Ray Irradiation Against Tumor Formation by Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Progenitors Cell replacement therapy holds great promise for Parkinson's disease (PD), but residual undifferentiated cells and immature neural progenitors in the therapy may cause tumor formation. Although cell sorting could effectively exclude these proliferative cells, from the viewpoint of clinical application, there exists no adequate coping strategy in the case of their contamination. In this study, we analyzed a component of proliferative cells in the grafts of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors and investigated the effect of radiation therapy on tumor formation. In our differentiating protocol, analyses of neural progenitors (day 19) revealed that the proliferating cells expressed early neural markers (SOX1, PAX6) or a dopaminergic neuron progenitor marker (FOXA2). When grafted into the rat striatum, these immature neurons gradually became postmitotic in the brain, and the rosette structures disappeared at 14 weeks. However, at 4-8 weeks, the SOX1(+)PAX6(+) cells formed rosette structures in the grafts, suggesting their tumorigenic potential. Therefore, to develop a fail-safe therapy against tumor formation, we investigated the effect of radiation therapy. At 4 weeks posttransplantation, when KI67(+) cells comprised the highest ratio, radiation therapy with (137)Cs Gammacell Exactor for tumor-bearing immunodeficient rats showed a significant decrease in graft volume and percentage of SOX1(+)KI67(+) cells in the graft, thus demonstrating the preventive effect of gamma-ray irradiation against tumorigenicity.

1461,"[Acoustic neuroma in Iceland for 30 years (1979-2009)] INTRODUCTION: Acoustic neuroma (AN) is a tumor of the 8th cranial nerve. The goal of this study was to find the incidence of AN in Iceland from 1979 - 2009 as well as investigate other epidemiological factors.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of patients with the AN diagnosis was gathered retrospectively through medical records. We looked at several epidemiological factors including age and symptoms at diagnosis, and the treatment chosen for each individual.RESULTS: The incidence rate of AN in Iceland is 1.24/100,000. About 10% of diagnosed tumors were found incidentally. Most of those were found in the last 10 years of the investigation and in that period fewer large and giant tumors at diagnosis. Present complaints of patients at diagnosis were hearing loss (69%), dysequilibrium/dizziness (47%) and tinnitus (43%). Treatments were surgery (n=47), observation (n=30) and gamma knife radiosurgery (n=16). We had information concerning postoperative hearing loss and facial paralysis in 39 patients who underwent surgery. Loss of hearing postoperatively occurred in 69% (n=27) and 44% (n=17) had facial paralysis. For an average of 3.5 years, 17% of tumors followed by imaging grew.CONCLUSION: The incidence of AN is similar to that in Europe and is increasing. More tumors are found incidentally. Small tumors can be followed by regular imaging, at least for the short term. Larger tumors are treated by surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery. A high percentage of patients receiving surgery lost their hearing postoperatively.",Included

1239,"Induced radioactivity in the blood of cancer patients following Boron Neutron Capture Therapy Since 1990, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has been used for over 400 cancer patients at the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI). After BNCT, the patients are radioactive and their (24)Na and (38)Cl levels can be detected via a Na-I scintillation counter. This activity is predominantly due to (24)Na, which has a half-life of 14.96 h and thus remains in the body for extended time periods. Radioactive (24)Na is mainly generated from (23)Na in the target tissue that is exposed to the neutron beam in BNCT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the radioactivity of blood (24)Na following BNCT and the absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field. To assess blood (24)Na, 1 ml of peripheral blood was collected from 30 patients immediately after the exposure, and the radioactivity of blood (24)Na was determined using a germanium counter. The activity of (24)Na in the blood correlated with the absorbed gamma ray doses in the irradiated field. For the same absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field, the activity of blood (24)Na was higher in patients with neck or lung tumors than in patients with brain or skin tumors. The reasons for these findings are not readily apparent, but the difference in the blood volume and the ratio of bone to soft tissue in the irradiated field, as well as the dose that leaked through the clinical collimator, may be responsible.",Excluded
2276,"Dynamics of Ca(2+) and Na(+) in the dendrites of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells evoked by parallel fibre stimulation Ca2+ and Na+ play important roles in neurons, such as in synaptic plasticity. Their concentrations in neurons change dynamically in response to synaptic inputs, but their kinetics have not been compared directly. Here, we show the mechanisms and dynamics of Ca2+ and Na+ transients by simultaneous monitoring in Purkinje cell dendrites in mouse cerebellar slices. High frequency parallel fibre stimulation (50 Hz, 3-50-times) depolarized Purkinje cells, and Ca2+ transients were observed at the anatomically expected sites. The magnitude of the Ca2+ transients increased linearly with increasing numbers of parallel fibre inputs. With 50 stimuli, Ca2+ transients lasted for seconds, and the peak [Ca2+] reached approximately 100 microm, which was much higher than that reported previously, although it was still confined to a part of the dendrite. In contrast, Na+ transients were sustained for tens of seconds and diffused away from the stimulated site. Pharmacological interventions revealed that Na+ influx through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and Ca2+ influx through P-type Ca channels were essential players, that AMPA receptors did not operate as a Ca2+ influx pathway and that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphate receptors or ryanodine receptors did not contribute greatly to the large Ca2+ transients.",Excluded

Background(s): The Raprl have been proposed as a neurosurgical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of PD since 1970's. Despite its clinical usefulness the anatomic connectivity of the Raprl remains unknown. Method(s): Images from 12 healthy subjects and 6 PD patients were acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. Diffusionweighted images were acquired using 120 unique diffusion-gradient directions with beta=2000s/mm2 (voxel size of 2x2x2mm3). Constrained spherical deconvolution was performed, followed by the creation of track-density images using MRtrix (Brain Research Institute Australia), resulting in final resolution of 0.2x0.2x0.2mm3; these images were crucial for the accurate manual segmentation of subthalamic structures. We seeded 50000 streamlines at the level of the Raprl, differences of streamlines interconnecting the Raprl between groups were assessed by Student's t-test. Result(s): All subjects showed Raprl connectivity with cortical and subcortical structures, when these fiber bundles enter the posterior limb of internal capsule they show a clear spatial organization according to their targets, from anterior to posterior as follows: 1) orbitofrontal cortex, 2) globus pallidus (GP) 3) supplementary motor area and 4) primary motor cortex and cerebellum. In 87.5% of healthy subjects GP showed connectivity with the contralateral dorsal brainstem in a region that corresponds to the location of the contralateral pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), the same connectivity pattern is present in 83.3% of PD patients. The number of reconstructed streamlines obtained showed differences between groups in the connectivity to pallidum (left p=0.017, right p=0.045) and in thalamus (left p=0.02, right p=0.006). Conclusion(s): PD patients that have undergone Raprl-DBS show an improvement on gait that also occurs after unilateral GP-DBS, which could be explained because of the bilateral connections from Raprl to PPN through fibers crossing the midline at lower midbrain. Our findings provide new insights into subthalamic connectivity that allow explaining clinical benefits obtained after Raprl-DBS.",Excluded

This study aimed to investigate the differential effect and mechanism of tumor microenvironments, cycling hypoxia and non-interrupted hypoxia, on tumor cell radiosensitivity in the human U87 glioblastoma tumor model. We exposed U87 cells and mice bearing U87 glioma to experimentally imposed cycling or non-interrupted hypoxic stress in vitro and in vivo prior to treatment with ionizing irradiation. Clonogenic survival assay and tumor growth measurements were performed to determine tumor radiosensitivity. The differential regulation of non-interrupted vs. cycling hypoxia by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and the impact of HIF-1alpha on hypoxia-induced radioresistance were assessed by molecular assay and RNAi-knockdown technology. Our results demonstrated that cycling hypoxia induced higher and longer term HIF-1 signal transduction activity via reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87 cells compared with non-interrupted hypoxia. Cycling hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha activation reflected ROS mediated HIF-1alpha synthesis and stabilization, whereas non-interrupted hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha activation was due to decreased HIF-1alpha degradation resulting from decreased prolyl hydroxylation. With regard to tumor radiosensitivity, cycling hypoxia induced more tumor cell radioresistance and a decreased response to radiotherapy in U87 cells compared with non-interrupted hypoxia. HIF-1 knockdown during in vitro and in vivo hypoxic stresses combined with radiotherapy suppressed cycling and non-interrupted hypoxia-induced radioresistance while increasing overall tumor radiosensitivity. Our results suggest that cycling hypoxia induces more radioresistance than non-interrupted hypoxia in U87 gliomas, and ROS mediated HIF-1alpha activation is a crucial mechanism involved in hypoxia-induced differential radioresistant in U87 gliomas.",Excluded

1632,"Environmental toxicology: Sensitive periods of development and neurodevelopmental disorders Development of the mammalian central nervous system is a complex process whose disruption may have severe and long-lasting consequences upon brain structure and function, potentially resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Many NDDs are known to be genetic in origin, with symptom onset and their underlying mechanisms now known to be regulated during time-dependent windows or 'critical periods' during normal brain development. However, it is increasingly evident that similar disturbances to the developing nervous system may be caused by exposure to non-genetic, environmental factors. Strikingly, at least 200 industrially applied or produced chemicals have been associated with neurotoxicity in humans and exposure to these modifying compounds, through consumer products or environmental pollution, therefore poses serious threats to public health. Through a combination of human epidemiological and animal experimental studies, we identified developmental periods for increased vulnerability to environmentally-modifying compounds and determined whether and how exposure during specific sensitive time-windows could increase the risk for the NDDs of autism, ADHD or schizophrenia in the developing organism. We report that many environmental toxicants have distinct sensitive time-windows during which exposure may disrupt critical developmental events, thereby increasing the risk of developing NDDs. The majority of these time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. We propose four underlying mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, altered neurotransmission and thyroid hormone disruption. Given the complexity of underlying mechanisms and their prenatal inception, treatment options are currently limited. Thus, we conclude that preventing early exposure to environmental toxicants, by increasing public awareness and improving government and industry guidelines, may ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of NDDs.

Beta-particle PRRT using <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-tyr -octreotate ( <sup>11</sup>Lu- DOTATATE) has been shown to significantly improve progression-free survival for NET patients compared to the standard of care treatment in a Phase 3 trial (1). However, the overall response rate is limited and complete responses are rare. Emerging evidence suggests that alpha-particle PRRT (alpha-PRRT) has the potential to improve tumor response. However, concerns regarding potential toxicities to normal organs and tissues (e.g., kidneys, bone marrow) mandate development and evaluation of personalized dosimetric approaches which can be used in clinical studies to reduce these toxicities. In this study, we evaluated potential renal and bone marrow toxicities arising from <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTA-tyr -octreotide ( <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC) in an animal model. A dosimetry study was performed on each animal with the aim of examining the relationship between localized <sup>212</sup>Pb alpha+beta dose to kidneys (a dose-limiting organ for beta PRRT) and markers of kidney function, injury, and kidney morphological changes. Method(s): 14.8 MBq of <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC was administered to tumor-free CD1-Elite (SOPF) mice via tail vein and SPECT/CT images were obtained at 1.5 h and 22 h post-injection. After 1.5 weeks, the same group of mice (8 mice) was divided into 4 groups, and each group was injected with escalating activities of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC (0.037, 0.074, 0.118, and 0.178 MBq/g). The absorbed dose (alpha/beta) from <sup>212</sup>P b - DOTATOC was estimated by the OLINDA/EXM software based on the time-activity curves obtained from <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC SPECT/CT images. The renal mass of each mouse used in this calculation was obtained from the CT-delineated volume with an assumed density of 1.05 g/cm<sup>2</sup> . In order to assess acute and chronic kidney injury by the radiotherapeutic, blood or urine were collected at day 1, day 3, week 3, week 12, and 7 months post-injection for analysis of nephrotoxicity parameters NGal (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and Cystatin C. Another group of four mice was injected with the highest dose (0.178 MBq/g), and hematological toxicity was evaluated by serial complete blood counts (up to 5 weeks). Result(s): Escalated activities of Pb-DOTATOC resulted in increased estimated alpha doses in kidneys (6.6 Gy to 35.2 Gy). Contributions of beta particles were minimal compared to the alpha particles accounting for less than 4% of the total absorbed dose. We found evidence for mild acute renal tubular toxicity based on measures of serum NGAL levels in 6 of the 8 treated mice, although the elevated levels appeared to show no relationship to the kidney doses in this study. There was no evidence of changes in renal function in this group when evaluated by continued normal levels of serum Cystatin C out to 12 weeks post administration of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC. We observed a 50% average decline in platelets and 40% average decline in WBC 2-3 weeks following administration of 0.178 MBq/g of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC in mice. These nadir values returned to baseline levels at 5 weeks post administration.

2055,"Successful endoscopic hemostasis with cryotherapy for a case of refractory esophageal cancer bleeding Gastrointestinal malignancy bleeding (GIMB) can be a clinical challenge. Options for treatment include surgical resection, radiation, angiography with embolization and endoscopic treatment (ET). Currently there is no standard of care for ET of GIMB. Modalities tried in the past include epinephrine injection, contact thermal devices, argon plasma coagulation (APC) and hemoclip (HC) placement. Cryotherapy (cryo) is a modality used for tumor ablation. It has also been successfully used in treatment of benign bleeding such as radiation proctitis and gastric antral vascular ectasia. There is one case report of cryo use in refractory GIMB leading to short term hemostasis (HS). We present a case of long term HS achieved by cryo in a patient with refractory GIMB. A 51 year old male with a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presented with melena. He was successfully treated with APC and was then referred for external beam radiation to prevent further bleeding. This combination achieved HS for around 8 months after which he presented with recurrent melena. A second attempt at treatment with APC achieved initial hemostasis but bleeding recurred 2 days later. Cryo was offered to him to aid with his dysphagia and possibly hemostasis. On EGD a fungating tumor oozing blood was seen in the distal third of the esophagus. Cryo was performed with 15 second freeze cycles. The patient experienced significant improvement in his dysphagia and resolution of his melena. The patient expired 2 months later due to newly diagnosed brain metastasis without recurrence of his melena. ET of GIMB continues to be a challenge. Multiple modalities can be tried including standard hemostatic maneuvers. Bleeding often recurs and can become refractory. Hemospray has been reported to be effective in these situations but is not available in the United States. Cryo, proven effective in refractory benign bleeding and approved for tumor ablation was used successfully in this patient. Cryo effect at standard application duration is limited to the superficial 5 mm of tissue. In addition to tumor necrosis has the theoretical advantage of forming crystal in the microvasculature leading to thrombosis and possibly hemostasis.

Fifty seven patients were treated with SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs, while another 57 patients were treated with WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs. The clinical efficacy, intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS), systemic progression-free survival (sPFS), overall survival (OS,) and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for imaging evaluation in both groups and all patients underwent symptomatic treatment such as dehydration or hormone therapy according to the patient's condition. The efficacy was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1) and adverse reactions were assessed based on the criteria for toxic reaction of anti-cancer drugs of WHO.RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in general conditions between the two groups of patients. The median iPFS and median sPFS were similar between the two groups (12.2 months vs. 11.5 months and 10.7 months vs. 9.8 months respectively, p>0.05). The median OS of patients treated with SRS + EGFR-TKIs was significantly longer than in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs (25.1 months vs. 22.0 months, respectively, p=0.042). No statistically significant differences were found in the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), the incidence rates of cytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and liver dysfunction between the two groups (p>0.05). There were 8 cases with radiotherapy-associated grade 3 or higher brain damage in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group compared to 19 cases in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that the incidence rate of radiation-induced brain injuries in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group was remarkably lower than those in WBRT + EGFR-TKIs group (p=0.026).CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs is comparable to that of WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of NSCLC patients with <=3 brain metastases and EGFR-sensitive mutation and the OS of patients is longer, with lower toxic side effect and higher safety, hence SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs should be used as the preferred therapeutic regimen.",Excluded
2410,"Diagnostic accuracy of low-dose versus ultra-low-dose CT for lumbar disc disease and facet joint osteoarthritis in patients with low back pain with MRI correlation OBJECTIVE: To compare the image quality, radiation dose, and diagnostic performance between low-dose (LD) and ultra-low-dose (ULD) lumbar-spine (L-spine) CT with iterative reconstruction (IR) for patients with chronic low back pain (LBP).METHODS: In total, 260 patients with chronic LBP who underwent L-spine CT between November 2015 and September 2016 were prospectively enrolled. Of these, 143 underwent LD-CT with IR and 117 underwent ULD-CT with IR. The patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI) into BMI1 (<22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), BMI2 (23.0-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and BMI3 (>=25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) groups. Two blinded radiologists independently evaluated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), qualitative image quality, and final diagnoses (lumbar disc disease and facet joint osteoarthritis). L-spine MRIs interpreted by consensus were used as the reference standard. All data were statistically analyzed.RESULTS: ULD protocol showed significantly lower SNR for all patients (p < 0.001) except the vertebral bodies and lower qualitative image quality for BMI3 patients (p <= 0.033). There was no statistically significant difference between ULD (sensitivity, 95.1-98.1%; specificity, 92.5-98.7%; accuracy, 94.6-98.0%) and LD protocols (sensitivity, 95.6-100%; specificity, 95.5-98.9%; accuracy, 97.4-98.1%), (all p>=0.1) in the BMI1 and BMI2; while dose was 60-68% lower with the ULD protocol. Interobserver agreements were excellent or good with regard to image quality and final diagnoses.CONCLUSIONS: For the BM1 and BMI2 groups, ULD-CT provided an acceptable image quality and exhibited a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of LD-CT. These findings suggest that it is a useful diagnostic tool for patients with chronic LBP who exhibit a BMI of <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.",Excluded
1518,"Early effects of whole-body (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function in C57BL/6J mice Relatively little is known about early irradiation effects on hippocampal function in wild-type mice. In this study, the effects of (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function were assessed starting 2 weeks after whole-body irradiation. Compared to sham irradiation, radiation impaired novel object recognition in female and male C57BL/6J wild-type mice. There were no effects of irradiation on contextual fear conditioning or spatial memory retention in the water maze. It is possible that oxidative damage might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive changes. Therefore, hippocampal and cortical levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and lipid peroxidation, measures of oxidative damage were assessed. There were no effects of irradiation on these measures of oxidative damage. As (56)Fe irradiation can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which may contribute to the impairments in novel object recognition, the effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on cognition following sham irradiation and irradiation were also assessed. ALA did not prevent radiation-induced impairments in novel object recognition and impaired spatial memory retention of sham-irradiated and irradiated mice in the probe trial after the first day of hidden platform training in the water maze. Thus, the novel object recognition test is particularly sensitive to detect early cognitive effects of (56)Fe irradiation through a mechanism unlikely involving ROS or oxidative damage.",Included

1593,"External beam radiotherapy for painful bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma: multiple fractions compared with an 8-Gy single fraction External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) bone metastases has not been popular in palliative therapy, and optimum dose schedules have not been decided because of limited published reports. We here evaluated the palliative effect of EBRT for HCC bone metastases and compared the dose-response relationship between multiple fractions (MFs) and an 8-Gy single fraction (SF). Twenty-eight patients (42 sites) with painful bone metastases who received EBRT and were analyzed retrospectively. Eight patients (12 sites) received SF. Of the remaining 20 patients (30 sites), 10 received MFs at moderate doses (20-30 Gy; 17 sites) and 10 received MFs at high doses (36-52 Gy; 13 sites). Overall response was achieved at 83% (35) of all sites; 75% (9) and 87% (26) for the SF and MF patients (88%, moderate dose; 85%, high dose), respectively. No significant differences in overall response were observed between each fraction schedule. Response duration was significantly longer for the high-dose MF patients than for the SF patients and moderate-dose MF patients (P < 0.05). SF was as effective as MF radiotherapy in terms of pain relief, but high-dose MF delivery relieved pain for a significantly longer duration.",Excluded
1951,"Repeat stereotactic radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for acoustic neuromas, we assessed tumor control, clinical outcomes, and the risk of adverse radiation effects in patients whose tumors progressed after initial management.METHODS AND MATERIALS: During a 21-year experience at our center, 1,352 patients underwent SRS as management for their acoustic neuromas. We retrospectively identified 6 patients who underwent SRS twice for the same tumor. The median patient age was 47 years (range, 35-71 years). All patients had imaging evidence of tumor progression despite initial SRS. One patient also had incomplete surgical resection after initial SRS. All patients were deaf at the time of the second SRS. The median radiosurgery target volume at the time of the initial SRS was 0.5 cc and was 2.1 cc at the time of the second SRS. The median margin dose at the time of the initial SRS was 13 Gy and was 11 Gy at the time of the second SRS. The median interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS was 63 months (range, 25-169 months).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months after the second SRS (range, 13-71 months), tumor control or regression was achieved in all 6 patients. No patient developed symptomatic adverse radiation effects or new neurological symptoms after the second SRS.CONCLUSIONS: With this limited experience, we found that repeat SRS for a persistently enlarging acoustic neuroma can be performed safely and effectively.",Excluded
1700,"11C-methionine-PET for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis: radiomics approach with random forest classifier Differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis is often difficult. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of 11C-methionine (MET)-PET radiomics for distinguishing recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, as compared with conventional tumor-to-normal cortex (T/N) ratio evaluation. We enrolled 41 patients with metastatic brain tumor or glioma treated using radiation therapy who underwent MET-PET. The area with a standardized uptake value > 1.3 times that of the normal brain cortex was contoured. Forty-two PET features were extracted and used in a random forest classifier and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Gini index was measured to identify relevant PET parameters for classification. The reference standard was surgical histopathological analysis or more than 6 months of follow-up with MRI. Forty-four lesions were used for the analysis. Thirty-three and 11 lesions were confirmed as recurrent brain tumor and radiation necrosis, respectively. Radiomics and T/N ratio evaluation showed sensitivities of 90.1% and 60.6%, and specificities of 93.9% and 72.7% with areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.73, respectively. Gray level co-occurrence matrix dissimilarity was the most pertinent feature for diagnosis. MET-PET radiomics yielded excellent outcome for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, which outperformed T/N ratio evaluation.",Excluded
2262,"Radiation-induced intra- and extra-cranial high-grade myxofibrosarcoma with tumor bleeding Radiation-induced secondary malignant neoplasms in central nervous system tumor survivors have become a problem of increasing concern over the last 20 years because of rare but serious and potentially fatal complications. Herein, we report the case of a 28-year-old man who presented with a left fronto-temporal intra- and extra-cranial tumor with intra-tumor bleeding at the site of previous radiotherapy in May 1991. He underwent craniotomy with gross total removal of the tumor and surrounding hematoma in August 2005. The tumor was a high-grade malignant myxofibrosarcoma (Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer Grade III [out of III]). Radiation-induced malignant myxofibrosarcoma with tumor bleeding is an infrequent complication of radiotherapy. Although rare, it should always be kept in mind with regards to the differential diagnosis of a lesion that develops several years after radiation therapy.

Eighty 12-14-week-old young adult male Fischer 344 rats received either: (1) sham irradiation, (2) 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation delivered as two 5 Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks, (3) sham irradiation plus continuous administration of 15 mg/L of ramipril in the drinking water starting 3 days before irradiation, or (4) fractionated whole-brain irradiation plus ramipril. Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, as hypothesized, continuous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can prevent the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function.",Included
1662,"A patient questionnaire for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy We analyzed the usefulness of a symptom questionnaire to screen for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP) after breast cancer treatment. Four questions addressed distal and proximal paresis: impaired hand functions, problems raising the arm, carrying weights, and lifting objects from a high shelf. Eighty-one relapse-free patients were neurologically examined. Treatment was mastectomy (51%) or breast-conserving surgery (49%), radiotherapy to the supraclavicular +/- axilla with median 60 Gy maximum dose. Sixty-five subsequent control patients had breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy to the breast only with 55 Gy median dose. Median follow up was 10 and 7.4 years, respectively. Sixteen patients had RIBP, 7 had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 1, 4 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and 2 grade 4 RIBP. Thirty-seven patients had fibrosis and 32 had arm edema. Four patients with RIBP had no fibrosis (n = 2) or fibrosis of the axilla only (n = 2). Specificity of the question ""impaired hand functions"" for RIBP was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78); sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96). Specificity of the question ""raising the arm"" was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.9-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04-0.45); the rate of false-positive control patients was 3%.

Patients with breast irradiation only stated moderate/pronounced impaired hand functions; and problems carrying weights and lifting objects from a high shelf in 38%, 58%, and 77%, not significantly different from patients with RIBP or the patients with supraclavicular radiation. RIBP is not necessarily associated with fibrosis. The aim of the questionnaire was screening of a population at risk for RIBP. In this group, the question ""problems raising the arm"" detected severe RIBP with high specificity. Negation of ""impaired hand functions"" excludes RIBP.

It is thought to be involved in tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis. Thus, the B1R may represent a highly promising new target for the development of cancer-targeted theranostic agents Methods We developed a new 64Cu/NOTA-conjugated analog of our potent, selective B1R peptide antagonist, R-954 (AcOrn[Oic2,(alphaMe)Phe5,DbetaNal7,Ile8]-desArg9-bradykinin). Stability of the resulting peptide conjugate was evaluated ex vivo in undiluted rat blood samples and in vivo within systemic circulation in healthy rats. Intracellular uptake/nuclear localization and radiocytotoxicity of the conjugate were studied in cultured F98 glioma cells. In vivo biodistribution profile and efficacy of detection of malignant brain tumors by PET, were evaluated using the syngeneic, orthotopic F98 glioma rat model Results 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 showed remarkable stability in rat plasma after a 24h incubation. In vivo stability study showed mainly intact radiolabeled peptide (no occurrence of radiotracer metabolites) in rat blood circulation and urine, 90min after tail-vein injection. In vitro, the conjugate supressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, clonogenic growth of F98 cells possibly through an intracellular radiation mechanism (i.e. via cellular/nuclear uptake). Intravenous 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 properly detected relatively small brain tumors by PET at 1.5h and 20h after injection. Moreover, muPET signals coincided perfectly with those of contrast-enhanced MRI. The conjugate exhibited high tumor-to-contralateral background uptake and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios (18:1 and 6:1, respectively) at 20h after injection. muPET signals generated by the radiotracer were i) inhibitable with excess of the unlabeled B1R antagonist R-954, ii) substantially reduced in B1R-knockdown F98 tumors, and iii) primarily absent in sham-operated animals, thus confirming the B1R-targeted tumor uptake specificity of the conjugate Conclusions Our findings provide initial proof-of-concept for the potential use of 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 radiotracer in both diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer, and possibly other types of B1R-positive solid cancers.",Excluded

At examination 4 6 months after irradiation, there were no obvious differences compared with controls concerning mast-cell numbers and neuropeptide expression. The ultrastructural changes seen in the subglottic glands remained to some extent. The results show that structural changes in the subglottic glands occur concomitantly with an increased expression of certain neuropeptides in the innervation of these glands, which implies a relationship between these two parameters.

However, previous reports are limited by small patient population. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological data of 53 patients with CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus who underwent GKRS at West China Hospital between May 2009 and July 2018. All patients suffered at least once bleeding before GKRS. The mean volume of these lesions was 1.77 cm, and the mean marginal dose was 13.2 Gy. After treatment, patients were followed to determine the change in symptom and hemorrhage event. Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 52.1 months (6.2-104.3 months). The calculated annual hemorrhage rate (AHR) was 48.5% prior to GKRS and 3.0% after treatment (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 2-, 3-, and 5-year hemorrhage-free survival were 88, 80.9, and 80.9%, respectively. Preexisting symptoms were resolved in 11 patients, improved in 14, and stable in 5. Only 2 patients (3.8%) developed new neurological deficit. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that AHR after GKRS was comparable to the recorded AHR of natural history (3.1-4.1%) in previous studies. GKRS is a safe and effective treatment modality for CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus. Considering the relative insufficient understanding of natural history of CMs, future study warrants longer follow-up. © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.",Excluded

The mutant enzyme catalyze the reduction of a-ketoglutaric acid to D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, leading to cancer initiation. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of SYC-435 (1-hydroxypyridin-2-one), a newly developed mutant IDH1inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo in IDH1 mutant gliomas as compared with IDH1 wild type GBMs. Method(s): An established neurosphere line (BT142) of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), and a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of recurrent AOA (ICV0914AOA), and 2 PDOX models of GBM (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) were included. IDH1 mutations (R132H and R132C) were analyzed by pyrosequencing. To determine the in vitro antitumor activities, tumor cells were exposed to SYC-435 (0.02 to 20 [iM) and examining for changes of cell proliferation every 3-4 days till day 13 by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. For in vivo effects, orthotopic xenograft mouse models of IC-BT142AOA and IC-V0914AOA were treated with vehicle (as control), SYC-435 (i.p., 15 mg/kg/day x 28 days), temozolomide (TMZ, oral, 50 mg/kg/day x 5 days) + fractionated radiation (XRT, 2 Gy/day x 5 days) (as standard therapy), and combination of SYC-435 with standard therapy starting 2 weeks after intracranial tumor implantation. Animal survival times were analyzed by log rank analysis. Result(s): IDH1 R132H mutation (homozygous) was detected in BT142AOA neurosphere line and R132C mutation (mutant allele frequency 39-42%) in IC-V0914AOA xenograft cells, while the two GBM models (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) carried wild-type IDH1. Suppression of cell growth was observed in time- and dosedependent manner by SYC-435, particularly at the IDH1 mutant models. At 0.5 ^M, SYC-435 inhibited cell growth by 90% in BT142 and 60% in IC-V0914AOA cells, whereas in IDH wild-type GBMs only by 17% in IC-4687GBM and 19% in IC-3752GBM cells at day 13, indicating the high selectivity of SYC-435 of mutant over wild type IDH1. Systematic in vivo treatment with SYC-435 alone did not alter survival times in neither IC-BT142AOA nor IC-V0914AOA models when compared with the control group. Although standard therapy significantly prolonged animal survival times in both models (P<0.0005), combining SYC-435 with standard therapies further extended the median survival times from 106 days (in the standard therapy group) to 124 days (P<0.05) in IC-V0914AOA and exhibited similar trend in IC-BT142AOA.

1950,"Predictors of hearing preservation after stereotactic radiosurgery for acoustic neuroma OBJECT: Many patients with acoustic neuromas (ANs) have hearing function at diagnosis and desire to maintain it. To date, radiosurgical techniques have been focused on conformal irradiation of the tumor mass, with less attention to inner ear structures for which there was scant radiobiological information. The authors of this study evaluated tumor control and hearing preservation as they relate to tumor volume, imaging characteristics, and nerve and cochlear radiation dose following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma Knife.METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with ANs had serviceable hearing (Gardner-Robertson [GR] Class I or II) and underwent SRS between 2004 and 2007. This interval reflected more recent measurements of inner ear dosimetry during the authors' 21-year experience. The median patient age was 52 years (range 22-82 years). No patient had undergone any prior treatment for the ANs. The median tumor volume was 0.75 cm(3) (range 0.07-7.7 cm(3)), and the median radiation dose to the tumor margin was 12.5 Gy (range 12-13 Gy). At diagnosis, a greater distance from the lateral tumor to the end of the internal auditory canal correlated with better hearing function.RESULTS: At a median of 20 months after SRS, no patient required any other additional treatment. Serviceable hearing was preserved in 71% of all patients and in 89% (46 patients) of those with GR Class I hearing. Significant prognostic factors for maintaining the same GR class included (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, a speech discrimination score (SDS) >or= 80%, a pure tone average (PTA) < 20 dB, and a patient age < 60 years. Significant prognostic factors for serviceable hearing preservation were (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, an SDS >or= 80%, a PTA < 20 dB, a patient age < 60 years, an intracanalicular tumor location, and a tumor volume < 0.75 cm(3). Patients who received a radiation dose of < 4.2 Gy to the central cochlea had significantly better hearing preservation of the same GR class. Twelve of 12 patients < 60 years of age who had received a cochlear dose < 4.2 Gy retained serviceable hearing at 2 years post-SRS.CONCLUSIONS: As currently practiced, SRS with the Gamma Knife preserves serviceable hearing in the majority of patients. Tumor volume and anatomy relate to the hearing level before radiosurgery and influence technique. A low radiosurgical dose to the cochlea enhances hearing preservation.",Excluded

It is suggested that biogenic monoamines are involved in the reduced glutathione changes observed. The changes are not uniform in the brain regions examined.",Excluded
2198,"Detection of abasic sites and oxidative DNA base damage using an ELISA-like assay Reactive oxygen species produce a wide spectrum of DNA damage, including oxidative base damage and abasic (AP) sites. Many procedures are available for the quantification and detection of base damage and AP sites. However, either these procedures are laborious or the starting materials are difficult to obtain. A biotinylated aldehyde-specific reagent, ARP, has been shown to react specifically with the aldehyde group present in AP sites, resulting in biotin-tagged AP sites in DNA. The biotin-tagged AP sites can then be determined colorimetrically with an ELISA-like assay, using avidin/biotin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase as the indicator enzyme. The ARP assay is thus a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the detection of AP sites in DNA. Furthermore, removal of damaged base by DNA N-glycosylases generates AP sites that can be measured by the ARP reagent. By coupling the ARP assay with either endonuclease III from Escherichia coli or 8-oxoguanine N-glycosylase (OGG1) from yeast, investigators can rapidly determine the amount of oxidative pyrimidine damage (endonuclease III-sensitive sites) or purine damage (OGG1-sensitive sites) in cellular DNA, respectively. An increased levei of oxidative damage has been implicated in several age-related human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, as well as the aging process. The sensitivity and simplicity of the ARP assay thus make it a valuable method for investigators who are interested in estimating the level of oxidative DNA damage in cells and tissues derived from patients with various age-related diseases or cancers. © 2000 Academic Press.",Excluded
1798,"Menstrual restoration in severe panhypopituitarism many years after cranial irradiation for suprasellar germinoma Purpose: We report a very rare case showing menstrual restoration in severe pan-hypopituitarism many years after cranial irradiation for suprasellar germinoma.Case: A 30-year-old, almost primarily amenorrheic woman with severe panhypopituitarism presented with cyclic genital bleeding for the previous five months. She had menstruated once, when she was 13 years old. When she was 14 years old, she was diagnosed with a suprasellar germinoma measuring 10 mm in diameter, which led to diabetes insipidus. Cranial irradiation with a total dose of 24 Gy and chemotherapy resulted in complete tumor remission. She developed severe hypopituitarism [luteinizing hormone (LH) = 0.4 mIU/mL, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) = 1.7 mIU/mL, and serum estradiol (E2) level < 10 pg/mL]. She had received multiple hormone replacement therapies for many years. When she was 29 years old, she expressed a desire to become pregnant. Serum gonadotropin and E2 levels increased (LH = 5.8 mIU/mL, FSH = 5.9 mIU/mL, and E2 = 58 pg/mL). She conceived with clomiphene therapy, and then delivered a healthy baby. Eight months after parturition, her basal body temperature and serum progesterone levels indicated recovery of ovulatory cycles. Ten months after parturition, she also spontaneously conceived.Conclusion: Menstrual restoration is very rare in severe panhypopituitarism after cranial irradiation. A relatively low dose of irradiation and small tumor size may have contributed to the recovery of menstruation in our patient.",Excluded

In the brain, ionizing radiation induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier by effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. Damage from directly irradiated cells can be transferred to surrounding non-exposed bystander cells, known as the radiation-induced bystander effect. We investigated involvement of connexin channels and paracrine signaling in radiation-induced bystander DNA damage in brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to focused X-rays. Irradiation caused DNA damage in the directly exposed area, which propagated over several millimeters in the bystander area. DNA damage was significantly reduced by the connexin channel-targeting peptide Gap26 and the Cx43 hemichannel blocker TAT-Gap19. ATP release, dye uptake, and patch clamp experiments showed that hemichannels opened within 5 min post irradiation in both irradiated and bystander areas. Bystander signaling involved cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and IP<inf>3</inf>, ATP, ROS, and NO signaling, with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, IP<inf>3</inf>, and ROS as crucial propagators of DNA damage. We conclude that bystander effects are communicated by a concerted cascade involving connexin channels, and IP<inf>3</inf>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, ROS, and NO as major contributors of regenerative signal expansion.

1808,"High linear energy transfer carbon radiation effectively kills cultured glioma cells with either mutant or wild-type p53 PURPOSE: A mutation in the p53 gene is believed to play an important role in the radioresistance of many cancer cell lines. We studied cytotoxic effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon beams on glioma cell lines with either mutant or wild-type p53.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell lines U-87 and U-138 expressing wild-type p53 and U-251 and U-373 expressing mutant p53 were used. These cells were irradiated with 290 MeV/u carbon beams generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in the National Institute of Radiologic Science or X-rays. A standard colony-forming assay and flow cytometric detection of apoptosis were performed. Cell cycle progression and the expression of p53, p21, and bax proteins were examined.RESULTS: High LET carbon radiation was more cytotoxic than low LET X-ray treatment against glioma cells. The effects of the carbon beams were not dependent on the p53 gene status but were reduced by G(1) arrest, which was independent of p21 expression. The expression of bax remained unchanged in all four cell lines.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that high LET charged particle radiation can induce cell death in glioma cells more effectively than X-rays and that cell death other than p53-dependent apoptosis may participate in the cytotoxicity of heavy charged particles. Thus, it might prove to be an effective alternative radiotherapy for patients with gliomas harboring mutated p53 gene.",Excluded
1939,"Implication of prostaglandins and histamine H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors in radiation-induced temperature responses of rats Exposure of rats to 1-15 Gy gamma radiation (<sup>60</sup>Co) induced hyperthermia, whereas 20-200 Gy induced hypothermia. Exposure either to the head or the whole body to 10 Gy induced hyperthermia, while body-only exposure produced hypothermia. This observation indicates that radiation-induced fever is a result of a direct effect on the brain. The hyperthermia due to 10 Gy was significantly attenuated by the pre- or post-treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Hyperthermia was also altered by the central administration of a mu-receptor antagonist naloxone but only at low doses of radiation. These findings suggest that radiation-induced hyperthermia may be mediated through the synthesis and release of prostaglandins in the brain and to a lesser extent to the release of endogenous opioid peptides. The release of histamine acting on H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors may be involved in radiation-induced hypothermia, since both the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, mepyramine, and H<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist, cimetidine, antagonized the hypothermia. The results of these studies suggest that the release of neurohumoral substances induced by exposure to ionizing radiation is dose dependent and has different consequences on physiological processes such as the regulation of body temperature. Furthermore, the antagonism of radiation-induced hyperthermia by indomethacin may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of fever resulting from accidental irradiations.",Included
2061,"Nanoparticle-mediated knockdown of DNA repair sensitizes cells to radiotherapy and extends survival in a genetic mouse model of glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) remains incurable, and recurrent tumors rarely respond to standard-of-care radiation and chemo-therapies. Therefore, strategies that enhance the effects of these therapies should provide significant benefits to GBM patients. We have developed a nanoparticle delivery vehicle that can stably bind and protect nucleic acids for specific delivery into brain tumor cells. These nanoparticles can deliver therapeutic siRNAs to sensitize GBM cells to radiotherapy and improve GBM treatment via systemic administration. We show that nanoparticle-mediated knockdown of the DNA repair protein apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1) sensitizes GBM cells to radiotherapy and extend survival in a genetic mouse model of GBM. Specific knockdown of Ape1 activity by 30% in brain tumor tissue doubled the extended survival achieved with radiotherapy alone. Ape1 is a promising target for increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy, and nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA is a promising strategy for tumor specific knockdown of Ape1.",Excluded
2006,"Rational design of nanosystems for simultaneous drug delivery and photodynamic therapy by quantum mechanical modeling Drug delivery systems are based on reversible interactions between carriers and drugs. Spacers are often introduced to tailor the type of interaction and to keep drugs intact. Here, we model a drug delivery system based on a functionalized curved TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle of realistic size (700 atoms - 2.2 nm) by the neurotransmitter dopamine to carry the anticancer chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX). The multiscale quantum chemical study aims at unraveling the nature and mechanism of the interactions between the components and the electronic properties of the composite system. We simulate the temperature effect through molecular dynamics runs of thermal annealing. Dopamine binds preferentially to low coordinated Ti sites on the nanoparticle through dissociated bidentate and chelate modes involving the diol groups. DOX is tethered by H-bonds, pi-pi stacking, dipole-dipole interactions and dispersion forces. Comparing different coverage densities of the spacer on the nanoparticle surface, we assess the best conditions for an effective drug transport and release: only at full coverage, DOX does not slip among the dopamine molecules to reach the nanoparticle surface, which is crucial to avoid the formation of stable coordinative bonds with under-coordinated Ti atoms. Finally, given the strong absorption properties and fluorescence of DOX and of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst, we model the effect of light irradiation through excited state calculations to localize excitons and to follow the charge carrier's life path. This fundamental study on the nature and mechanism of drug/carrier interaction provides a solid ground for the rational design of new experimental protocols for a more efficient drug transport and release and its combination with photodynamic therapy.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation in vitro assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251,U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. Result(s): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect of TMZ in U251 cell which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression. Increased radiosensitizing effects of TMZ were associated with impaired DNA damage repair, apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with radiation and TMZ. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell which was originated from a patient with high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT.

Also, the washout of radioactivity from tissue was slower, and the dose of radiation exposure was estimated to be higher, with TW-80 than with HSA.

While the benefits of Computed Tomography (CT) are well known in accurate diagnosis, those benefits are not risk-free. CT is a device with higher patient dose in comparison with other conventional radiation procedures.OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating radiation dose to patients from Computed Tomography (CT) examination in Mazandaran hospitals and defining diagnostic reference level (DRL).METHODS: Patient-related data on CT protocol for four common CT examinations including brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic were collected. In each center, Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI) measurements were performed using pencil ionization chamber and CT dosimetry phantom according to AAPM report No. 96 for those techniques. Then, Weighted Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIW), Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI vol) and Dose Length Product (DLP) were calculated.RESULTS: The CTDIw for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic ranged (15.6-73), (3.8-25. 8), (4.5-16.3) and (7-16.3), respectively. Values of DLP had a range of (197.4-981), (41.8-184), (131-342.3) and (283.6-486) for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic, respectively.

Wilcoxon Sign Ranked tests compared mean severity or pre- and post-RT pain and skin problems within each RT-site subgroup. Multiple linear regression (MLR) investigated associations between skin symptoms and pain.RESULTS: Survey respondents (N = 106) were 58% female and on average 64 years old. RT sites included lung, breast, lower abdomen, head/neck/brain, and upper abdomen. Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in treatment site pain and skin problems (P < or = .007). Patients receiving head/neck/brain RT reported increased skin problems (P < .0009). MLR showed that post-RT skin tenderness and tightness were most strongly associated with post-RT pain (P = .066 and P = .122, respectively).LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, exploratory analyses, and nonvalidated measure.CONCLUSIONS: Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in pain and skin problems at the RT site while patients receiving head/neck/brain RT had increased skin problems but not pain. These findings suggest that the severity of skin problems is not the only factor that contributes to pain and that interventions should be tailored to specifically target pain at the RT site, possibly by targeting tenderness and tightness. These findings should be confirmed in a larger sampling of RT patients.",Excluded

High threshold evoked responses (conduction velocity was about 11 m/sec, unmyelinated A delta), which were induced by an electrical stimulation to the peripheral stump of the nerve, were significantly suppressed (9 to 19% inhibition) during low-power laser irradiation, which applied to the exposed sural nerve between the stimulus site and the recording site. The suppressive effect was reversible and recovered to the control level after the irradiation. Experimental evidence indicated that low-power laser irradiation suppressed the impulse conduction of unmyelinated A delta afferents in peripheral sensory nerve, which caused a pain sensation.

1779,"A simpler method for total scalp irradiation: the multijaw-size concave arc technique The lateral electron-photon technique (LEPT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are commonly used for total scalp irradiation. However, the treatment planning and irradiation are laborious and time-consuming. We herein present the multijaw-size concave arc technique (MCAT) as a total scalp irradiation method that overcomes these problems. CT datasets for eight patients previously treated for angiosarcoma of the scalp were replanned using MCAT, LEPT, and IMRT. The MCAT was designed with a dynamic conformal arc for the total scalp, with a multileaf collimator to shield the brain. Two additional conformal arcs with a decreased upper-jaw position of the first dynamic conformal arc were used to reduce the cranial hotspots. The prescribed dose was 40 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV, defined as the total scalp plus a 4 mm margin). MCAT was compared with LEPT and IMRT with respect to the PTV dose homogeneity (D5%-95%), underdosage (V < 90%), overdosage (V > 110%), doses to the brain, and the delivery time and monitor units (MUs) for single irradiation. We were able to formulate treatment plans for all three techniques that could deliver the prescription dose in all patients. MCAT was significantly superior to LEPT with respect to PTV dose homogeneity, overdosage, and underdosage, although MCAT was inferior to IMRT with respect to dose homogeneity and overdosage. The mean brain dose and high-dosage volume of all three techniques were low, but IMRT provided larger volume to the brain than did the other two techniques in the low dosage region. In MCAT, the mean delivery time could be reduced by approximately half or more, and the mean MUs could be reduced by at least 100 compared to the other two techniques. MCAT can achieve total scalp irradiation with substantially fewer MUs and a shorter delivery time than LEPT and IMRT.",Excluded
1363,"Adult patient doses in interventional neuroradiology We investigated radiation doses to 149 adult patients who underwent interventional neuroradiologic procedures, consisting of 132 patients who had diagnostic imaging examinations and 17 patients who had therapeutic procedures. The interventional procedures were carried out on a biplane system capable of performing fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The x-ray imaging system was interfaced to a patient dosimetry system, which computed surface (skin) doses based on the selected radiographic technique factors in each of the radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging modes. For each patient, an assessment was made of the maximum surface dose received during the procedure, which predicts the possibility of inducing deterministic effects. Knowledge of the surface doses, beam quality and x-ray cross sectional area permitted the computation of the total energy imparted to each patient. Energy imparted values were converted to effective dose, which provides an estimate of the stochastic radiation risk to the patient. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during diagnostic imaging examinations was 1.3 Gy, with a maximum surface dose of 5.1 Gy. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during therapeutic procedures was 2.8 Gy with a maximum surface dose of 5.0 Gy. Ratios of the lateral to frontal median surface doses were 0.47 for diagnostic examinations and 0.68 for interventional procedures. The median energy imparted was 1.8 J during fluoroscopy, and 4.3 J during radiography, showing that on average, 66% of the patient exposure comes from radiographic imaging (DSA). For diagnostic examinations, the median patient effective dose was 33 mSv, with a maximum of 152 mSv. For therapeutic procedures, the median patient effective dose was 74 mSv, with a maximum of 156 mSv. In interventional neuroradiology, surface doses could induce deterministic effects, and the corresponding effective doses are noticeably higher than those normally encountered in diagnostic radiology.",Excluded
1690,"Distinct functional domains of Nbs1 modulate the timing and magnitude of ATM activation after low doses of ionizing radiation The ATM kinase is a tumour suppressor and a key activator of genome integrity checkpoints in mammalian cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) and other insults that elicit DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In response to IR, autophosphorylation on serine 1981 causes dissociation of ATM dimers and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Here, we show that the kinetics and magnitude of ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation after exposure of human fibroblasts to low doses (2 Gy) of IR are altered in cells deficient in Nbs1, a substrate of ATM and a component of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex involved in processing/repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent cell cycle checkpoints. Timely phosphorylation of both ATM Ser1981 and the ATM substrate Smc1 after IR were rescued via retrovirally mediated reconstitution of Nbs1-deficient cells by wild-type Nbs1 or mutants of Nbs1 defective in the FHA domain or nonphosphorylatable by ATM, but not by Nbs1 lacking the Mre11-interaction domain. Our data indicate that apart from its role downstream of ATM in the DNA damage checkpoint network, the MRN complex serves also as a modulator/amplifier of ATM activity. Although not absolutely required for ATM activation, the MRN nuclease complex may help reach the threshold activity of ATM necessary for optimal genome maintenance and prevention of cancer.",Excluded

Whether these five prognostic factors integrated in the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score have a time-dependent effect is questionable. Among 132 PCNSL patients treated at our institution between 1984 and 2006, 91 available patients for IELSG score were evaluated by time-segmented analysis. Of the 91 patients, 21% had 0-1, 59% had 2-3 and 20% had 4-5 adverse IELSG prognostic scores. With a median follow-up of 102months, the median overall survival (OS) of the 91 patients with the five prognostic factors of IELSG score was 33months (95% CI, 17 to 55) compared with 14months (95% CI, 3 to 23) for the remaining 41 patients whose CSF protein level was lacking in the IELSG score. These 41 patients who did not have lumbar puncture presented a poorer PS at diagnosis and a lower treatment response rate. While confirming the prognostic value of the IELSG score, we observed a time-dependent effect of age, PS and tumour site; all three lost their prognostic value after 6months from diagnosis, while LDH remained a constant predictor of OS. No prognostic impact of CSF protein level was reported. Patients with older age, poor PS and deep brain involvement are at risk of death during the first months after diagnosis but could have a favourable long-term outcome after the treatment period. New prognostic factors predicting long-term outcome remain to be determined. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
1614,"Automated image enhancement (clarityiq) to reduce radiation dosage without loss of image quality Background: Excess radiation exposure is related with adverse events. Therefore the allowed radiation dosage for healthcare workers is regulated by governing agencies. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle still applies. ClarityIQ is an automated algorithm developed to reduce the radiation dosage used without loss of image quality. Method(s): Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure). Images were reviewed by three independent reviewers and scored on subjective image quality, good, fair, poor. Result(s): Our preliminary data demonstrate that 47 patients (mean age 62.8 +/- 11.1) were enrolled with a mean BMI of 26.6 kg/m2 +/- 3.7. All had normal kidney function (MDRD > 60) and no known previous myocardial infarction of the LCA. The image quality of the ClarityIQ images was of adequate diagnostic quality in all patients as assessed by the operator. Independent reviewers assessed the images as good in 29, fair in 18 and poor in none. Reduction in mean DAP was 58%, mean DAP of ClarityIQ was 1126 mGy.cm2 and 1955 mGy.cm2 for the standard image acquisition. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm, adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 58% of radiation dose. Thus resulting in less stochastic effects of radiation for the cath-lab personnel and also less deterministic effects for the patient.

In this study, the seven-person crew (four men, three women) lived a Martian sol (24.65 h) for 37 d during a long-term stay at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) on Devon Island, Canada. Crewmembers underwent cardiopulmonary monitoring for signs of circadian disruption and completed a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Diary to monitor subjective fatigue. Crewmembers underwent cognitive testing to identify the effects, if any, of sleep disruption upon cognitive skill.METHODS: A Martian sol was implemented for 37 d during the Arctic mission. Each crewmember completed an adapted version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary in tandem with electrocardiograph (ECG) cardiopulmonary monitoring of sleep by the Cardiac Adapted Sleep Parameters Electrocardiogram Recorder (CASPER). Crewmembers also underwent cognitive testing during this time period.RESULTS: Sleep diary data indicate improvement in alertness with the onset of the sol (fatigue decreasing from 5.1 to 4.0, alertness increasing from 6.1 to 7.0). Cardiopulmonary data suggest sleep instability, though trends were not statistically significant. Crewmember decision speed time scores improved from pre-Mars to Mars (average improving from 66.5 to 84.0%), though the remainder of cognitive testing results were not significant.DISCUSSION: While subjective data demonstrate improved sleep and alertness during the sol, objective data demonstrate no significant alteration of sleep patterns.

2403,"The role played by SLUG, an epithelialmesenchymal transition factor, in invasion and therapeutic resistance of malignant glioma Purpose: In malignant gliomas, invasive phenotype and cancer stemness promoting resurgence of residual tumor cells, render treatment very difficult. Hence, identification of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors associated with invasion and stemness of glioma cells is critical. Method(s): To address the issue, we investigated several EMT factors in hypermotile U87MG and U251 cells, mouse xenograft model, and human glioma samples. Of several EMT markers, SLUG expression was notably increased at the invasive fronts of gliomas, both in mouse tumor xenografts and human glioma samples. The biological role played by SLUG was investigated using a colony-forming assay after chemotherapy and irradiation, and by employing a neurosphere culture assay. The effect of SLUG on glioma progression was examined in our patient cohort and samples, and compared to large public data from the REMBRANDT and TCGA. Result(s): Genetic upregulation of SLUG was associated with increased levels of stemness factors and enhanced resistance to radiation and temozolomide. In our cohort, patients exhibiting lower-level SLUG expression evidenced longer progression-free survival (P=0.042). Also, in the REMBRANDT dataset, a group in which SLUG was downregulated exhibited a significant survival benefit (P<0.001). Although paired gliblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples from our patients did not showed significant increase of SLUG expression, increased mRNA levels of SLUG was found in recurred GBM from TCGA (P=0.052), and in TMZ-treated glioma cells and mouse xenograft. Conclusion(s): SLUG may contribute to glioma progression by controlling invasion at infiltrating margins, associated with increased stemness and therapeutic resistance.",Excluded
1430,"Immunotherapy of diffuse gliomas: biological background, current status and future developments Despite aggressive multimodal treatment approaches, the prognosis for patients with diffuse gliomas remains disappointing. Glioma cells often extensively infiltrate in the surrounding brain parenchyma, a phenomenon that helps them to escape surgical removal, radiation exposure and chemotherapy. Moreover, conventional therapy is often associated with considerable local and systemic side effects. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic approaches is essential to improve the outcome of these patients. Immunotherapy offers the opportunity to specifically target residual radio-and chemoresistant tumor cells without damaging healthy neighboring brain tissue. Significant progress has been made in recent years both in understanding the mechanisms of immune regulation in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as tumor-induced and host-mediated immunosuppression elicited by gliomas. In this review, after discussing the special requirements needed for the initiation and control of immune responses in the CNS, we focus on immunological phenomena observed in glioma patients, discuss different immunological approaches to attack glioma-associated target structures and touch on further strategies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy of gliomas.

1334,"Expandable intramedullary nails for fixation of tibial shaft fractures Interlocking intramedullary nailing is currently the preferred treatment for most tibial fractures requiring operative treatment, with good results and a relatively low complication rate as reported in large clinical series. However, vascular and neurological complications caused by interlocking screws have been reported. In addition, insertion of distal interlocking screws can be technically demanding and may entail substantial exposure. We present the results with an expandable self-locking nail in the management of 52 AO type A and B tibial shaft fractures. The mean time to union was 15.8 weeks and the rate of union was 98%. The average surgical time was 60 minutes. Complications were those usually seen in diaphysis nailing and no complication was noted during nail expansion. Interlocking screws are not necessary, which reduces the risk of iatrogenic lesions. The expandable nail allows effective management of AO type A and B diaphyseal fractures of the tibia, a lower radiation exposure and shorter operative time.",Excluded
1390,"Superficial anatomy of the neonatal cerebrum - an ultrasonographic roadmap Neurosonography is an essential imaging modality for assessing the neonatal brain, particularly as a screening tool to evaluate intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus and periventricular leukomalacia. The primary advantages of neurosonography include portability, accessibility and lack of ionizing radiation. Its main limitations are intrinsic operator dependence and the need for an open fontanelle. Neurosonographic imaging acquisition is typically performed by placing a sector transducer over the anterior fontanelle and following sagittal and coronal sweeps. The sensitivity of neurosonography has markedly improved thanks to the adoption of modern imaging equipment, the use of dedicated head probes, and the employment of advanced diagnostic US techniques. These developments have facilitated more descriptive identification of specific cerebral anatomical details, improving understanding of the cerebral anatomy by conventional US. Such knowledge is fundamental for enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and is a key to understanding pathological states. Furthermore, familiarity with normal anatomy is crucial for understanding pathological states. Our primary goal in this review was to supplement these technological developments with a roadmap to the cerebral landscape. We accomplish this by presenting a systematic approach to using routine US for consistent identification of the most crucial cerebral landmarks, reviewing their relationship with adjacent structures, and briefly describing their primary function.",Excluded

This gender difference arises after hatching as a result of cell atrophy in the female and cell growth in the male. Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins. Estrogen loses its masculinizing effects completely after day 45 when the adult level of neuronal atrophy is reached. Thus, the end and the intensity of hormone action appear to be correlated with the timing of neuronal atrophy.",Excluded

Thirteen young right-handed male subjects were exposed to a pulse-modulated 902.4 MHz Global System for Mobile Communications signal for 33 minutes, while performing a simple visual vigilance task. Temperature was also measured in the head region (forehead, eyes, cheeks, ear canals) during exposure. (18)F-deoxyglucose PET images acquired after the exposure showed that relative cerebral metabolic rate of glucose was significantly reduced in the temporoparietal junction and anterior temporal lobe of the right hemisphere ipsilateral to the exposure. Temperature rise was also observed on the exposed side of the head, but the magnitude was very small. The exposure did not affect task performance (reaction time, error rate).

1501,"In vivo imaging of human limbic responses to nitrous oxide inhalation Human behavioral studies have shown that nitrous oxide, in subanesthetic concentrations, impairs psychomotor function, cognitive performance, and learning and memory processes. However, the cerebral mechanisms of such effects remain unknown. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to map the brain areas associated with nitrous oxide effects. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight volunteers, during room air (control) or 20% nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide) inhalation using 15(O)-water, to reflect regional neuronal activity. To control for the possibility that 20% nitrous oxide uncoupled cerebral blood flow and metabolism, in four of the subjects, regional cerebral metabolic rate (rCMR) was also measured using 18F-deoxyglucose during the two experimental conditions. Results of rCBF and rCMR scans were compared between conditions using the statistical parametric mapping method, and areas of nitrous oxide-related activation or deactivation were identified at a significance level of 0.005. Percent changes in rCBF scan pixels from these activated or deactivated areas were then compared with those of stereotactically corresponding rCMR scan pixels with t statistics (P < 0.05 was defined as a significant difference). It was found that cerebral blood flow and metabolism were not uncoupled by 20% nitrous oxide, since percent changes in rCBF and rCMR, detected during nitrous oxide inhalation, did not differ significantly from each other (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide inhalation was associated with significant activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a limbic area known to mediate psychomotor and cognitive processes. Deactivation was found in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and visual association cortices in both hemispheres; the former two regions are known to mediate learning and memory. These areas identified by PET in vivo may provide the neuroanatomical basis for the behavioral responses associated with subanesthetic nitrous oxide inhalation.",Excluded

1986,"Combining pedicle screw stimulation with spinal navigation, a protocol to maximize the safety of neural elements and minimize radiation exposure in thoracolumbar spine instrumentation Purpose: The O-arm-based navigation increases the accuracy of pedicle screw positioning and offers the possibility of performing a 3D scan before wound closure. However, repeating the 3D scan exposes the patient to additional radiation. We combined O-arm navigation with pedicle screw (PS) stimulation followed by a 3D scan to evaluate their accuracy and aimed for the creation of a protocol that maximizes the safety and minimizes radiation. Method(s): Patients had pedicle screws insertion using O-arm spinal navigation, then had PS triggered electromyography (EMG), and finally a 3D scan to evaluate the accuracy of screw position. Result(s): 447 screws were inserted in 71 patients. In 10 patients, 11 screws needed repositioning. Comparing results of PS triggered EMG responses to the 3D scan, we found: (a) negative stimulation response with negative 3D scan findings, corresponding to 432 acceptable screw position (96.6 %) in 58 patients (81.7 %). In these cases, the redo 3D scan could be avoided. (b) Positive stimulation response with positive 3D scan findings, corresponding to 7 unacceptable screw position (1.5 %) in 6 patients (8.4 %). In these cases, PS stimulation detected malpositioned screws that would be missed without a redo 3D scan. Conclusion(s): We propose a protocol of routinely performing PS stimulation after screw insertion using spinal navigation. In case of positive stimulation, a 3D scan must be performed to rule out a probable screw mal position (6 patients 8.4 %). However, in case of negative stimulation, redo 3D scan can be avoided in 81.7 % of patients. Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

1497,"Use of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to measure radiation-induced chromosome damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines To establish the optimal experimental conditions for the use of the micronuclei (MN) test to determine the level of chromosomal damage induced by ionising radiation (IR) exposure in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a time-course study was performed comparing a normal and an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, the latter being characterised by an extreme radiation sensitivity. Several parameters were analysed: the use of cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) to quantify MN, the optimum fixation time to measure radiation-induced MN, the most appropriate treatment dose of IR to distinguish between the normal and the radiosensitive cells and the cell-cycle distribution after irradiation. The results obtained showed that the spontaneous as well as the radiation-induced levels of MN were significantly higher in the AT cell compared to the normal cells (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In both cell types the number of radiation-induced MN were lower in the cultures without Cyt-B than those with Cyt-B (P < 0.001), with the AT cells being distinguished in terms of IR-induced MN from the normal cells only with the addition of Cyt-B. The level of MN formation was independent of the dose of Cyt-B used (3 or 6 microg/ml). The optimum time for radiation-induced MN measured was found to be between 48 and 72 h post-irradiation, with 2 and 4 Gy exposures inducing similar levels of MN. However, as the higher dose caused a greater delay in the cell-cycle, treatment with 2 Gy with MN measurement at 48 h in the presence of 3 microg/ml Cyt-B were chosen as the optimum experimental conditions. This choice was validated using two additional normal and AT cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that the use of Cyt-B increases the sensitivity of the MN test for comparing differences in radiosensitivity between lymphoblastoid cell lines.",Excluded

It is unknown, if similar pathology occurs in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). We thus examined immunized C57BL/6 mice after single vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) and naive C57BL/6 mice upon infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA-expressing mCherry. All mice were assessed according to the Rapid Murine Coma and Behavioral Scale (RMCBS) score once naive mice showed ECM. We further analyzed brain pathology by using high resolution small animal MRI in order to assess brain swelling and blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), immunohistochemical staining for microglia, single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to locate parasites microscopically and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to study parasites on a nanoscopic level. In contrast to naive mice, that showed extensive BBBD and brain swelling, all immunized mice survived the challenge and showed either reversible brain swelling and mild BBBD or no pathological signal alteration on MRI. Furthermore, less microglial activation was found in immunized mice compared to naive mice. However, along the rostral migratory stream microglial activation appeared to be similar in both groups. Distinct brain areas with higher parasite density could be observed in both groups, although parasite distribution was more disseminated in naive mice. By employing CLEM, we demonstrated that parasites have a high propensity towards the endothelium. In summary, we showed for the first time that reversible brain swelling also occurs in a mouse model of ECM by using advanced imaging techniques. We further identified hot spots of parasite accumulation and inflammation. This model may present a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms of reversible brain swelling in ECM. .",Excluded
1370,"Parietal rTMS disrupts the initiation but not the execution of on-line adjustments to a perturbation of object size Previous studies have implicated the human parietal lobes in the on-line guidance of action. However, no study to date has examined at what stage in the on-line adjustment process do the parietal lobes play their most critical role. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied over the left intraparietal sulcus as participants reached to grasp a small or large illuminated cylinder. On some trials, the illumination could suddenly switch from the small to large cylinder, or vice-versa. Small-Large switches were associated with relatively early grip aperture adjustments, whereas Large-Small switches were associated with relatively late grip aperture adjustments. When rTMS was applied early in the movement, it disrupted on-line adjustments to Small-Large target switches, but not to Large-Small switches. Conversely, when rTMS was applied late in the movement, it disrupted adjustments to Large-Small target switches but not to Small-Large switches. The timing of the disruption by rTMS appeared linked to the initiation of the adjustment. It was concluded that the left parietal lobe plays a critical role in initiating an on-line adjustment to a change in target size, but not in executing that adjustment. The implications of these results for current views of on-line control are discussed.",Excluded
1364,"Effect of radiographic techniques (kVp and mAs) on image quality and patient doses in digital subtraction angiography We investigated how varying the x-ray tube voltage and image receptor input exposure affected image quality and patient radiation doses in interventional neuroradiologic imaging. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images were obtained of a phantom with 1 mm diameter vessels containing iodine at concentrations between 4.5 and 50 mg/cc. The detection threshold concentration of iodine was determined by inspecting DSA images obtained at a range of x-ray tube voltages and input exposure levels. Surface doses were obtained from measured x-ray tube output data, and corresponding values of energy imparted were determined using the exposure-area product incident on the phantom. In one series of experiments, the air kerma at the image intensifier (X) was varied between 0.44 muGy per frame and 8.8 muGy per frame at a constant x-ray tube voltage of 70 kVp. In a second series of experiments, the tube voltage was varied between 50 and 100 kVp, and the mAs adjusted to maintain a constant exposure level at the input of the image intensifier. At a constant x-ray tube voltage, the surface dose and energy imparted were directly proportional to the input exposure per frame used to acquire the DSA images. On our DSA system operated below 2.2 muGy per frame, the threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to X<sup>-0.57</sup>, which is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction for a quantum noise limited imaging system. Above 2.2 muGy per frame, however, the threshold iodine concentration was proportional to X<sup>-0.26</sup>, indicating that increasing the input exposure above this value will only achieve modest improvements in image quality. At a constant image intensifier input exposure level, increasing the x-ray tube voltage from 50 kVp to 100 kVp reduced the surface dose by a factor of 6.1, and the energy imparted by a factor of 3.5. The detection threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to kVp<sup>n</sup>, where n was 2.1 at 1.1 muGy per frame, and 1.6 at 3.9 muGy per frame.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), used as potent acid suppressants, are associated with HE occurrence in cirrhotic patients. However, it is still unknown if PPIs contribute to mortality in cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastrointestinal bleeding.METHODS: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to identify 1004 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding, who received oral PPIs between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. On the basis of comorbid disorder data, we used propensity score matching at a 1:4 ratio to select 4016 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding who did not receive PPIs as a comparison group.

The flash-induced reflectance increases (bleaching) were calculated by dividing the reflectance of the first image into the subsequent images, pixel by pixel.RESULTS: The topography of the bleached macula corresponded well with the anatomical distribution of the cones. The ratio of reflectance changes in the center to that in the surrounding tissue was high for red and low for green and blue images. These results indicate that the reflectivity changes were not artifacts but were derived from changes in the photopigment density in the cones and rods.CONCLUSIONS: The topography of bleached photoreceptors obtained with a commercial fundus camera from one monkey and three healthy human subjects showed that this technique has potential as a new clinical method for examining photoreceptor function in both normal and diseased retinas.",Excluded
1708,"Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening Enhances GSK-3 Inhibitor Delivery for Amyloid-Beta Plaque Reduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of age-related dementia. Currently, therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS is a valued approach for AD therapy. Unfortunately, the CNS penetration is greatly hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused-ultrasound (FUS) has been demonstrated to temporally open the BBB, thus promoting therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS. Recently, the BBB opening procedure was further reported to clear the deposited Abeta plaque due to microglia activation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the use of FUS-induced BBB opening to enhance GSK-3 inhibitor delivery, which would bring additive effect of Abeta plaque clearance by FUS with the reduction of Abeta plaque synthesis by GSK-3 inhibitor in an AD mice model.

Method(s): Participants were assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck module (MDASI-HN), with subsequent analysis. Result(s): Of the 122 participants analyzed, the majority (63%) had no frank detectable cognitive impairment by TICS, with frank impairment in 6%. Overall, mean patient-reported problems with memory (MDASI<inf>memory</inf>) was 3.3 (SD +/-2.66). On recursive partition analysis, the MDASI<inf>memory</inf> cutoff point of >=5 was associated with detectable cognitive impairment by TICS (logworth 1.69; P =.02), yet no MDASI<inf>memory</inf> threshold was associated with unambiguous absence of impairment by TICS. Conclusion(s): Approximately one third of patients had ambiguous results by TICS assessment, for whom more rigorous testing may be warranted. Moderate to severe levels of patient-reported memory complaints on the MDASI-HN module may have utility as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in this population.

1444,"Driver or coincidence detector: modal switch of a corticothalamic giant synapse controlled by spontaneous activity and short-term depression Giant synapses between layer 5B (L5B) neurons of somatosensory (barrel) cortex and neurons of the posteromedial nucleus (POm) of thalamus reside in a key position of the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop, yet their synaptic properties and contribution to CTC information processing remain poorly understood. Fluorescence-guided local stimulation of terminals were combined with postsynaptic whole-cell recordings in thalamus to study synaptic transmission at an identified giant synapse. We found large EPSCs mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors. A single presynaptic electrical stimulus evoked a train of postsynaptic action potentials, indicating that a single L5B input can effectively drive the thalamic neuron. Repetitive stimulation caused strong short-term depression (STD) with fast recovery. To examine how these synaptic properties affect information transfer, spontaneous and evoked activity of L5B neurons was recorded in vivo and played back to giant terminals in vitro. We found that suprathreshold synaptic transmission was suppressed because of spontaneous activity causing strong STD of the L5B-POm giant synapse. Thalamic neurons only spiked after intervals of presynaptic silence or when costimulating two giant terminals. Therefore, STD caused by spontaneous activity of L5B neurons can switch the synapse from a ""driver mode"" to a ""coincidence mode."" Mechanisms decreasing spontaneous activity in L5B neurons and inputs synchronized by a sensory stimulus may thus gate the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop.",Excluded

The color of the background light was changed with 29 interference filters (400-700 nm). Waveforms were analyzed by means of principal component analysis to investigate interaction between the short-wavelength cone and other systems. With the same test lights, responses were also recorded during dark adaptation after 20,000-lux full bleach. The shape of the short-wavelength cone electroretinogram changed as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic background light. The change was clearer around 500-nm background light, to which the rod system is highly sensitive. Further, short-wavelength cone responses developed during the first 15 min in the dark; however, they became smaller with the recovery of the rod system. These findings suggest that there is interaction between the short-wavelength cone and rod systems. In addition, the results of waveform analysis confirmed the interaction between the long-wavelength and middle-wavelength cone systems.",Excluded

Knowledge about repeatability of these measurements is required to ensure correct interpretation, especially when assessing differences between antibody biodistributions. However, repeatability of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb PET is unknown, as radiation exposure is significant, thereby limiting test-retest studies. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of image reconstruction to the repeatability of tissue uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb for quantification of antibody biodistribution. Method(s): Three clinical <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb PET datasets were included: <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20 (1, 72, 144 h post injection (p.i.) of 74MBq, n=7), <sup>89</sup>Zr-cetuximab (1, 72, 144 h p.i. of 37MBq, n=7) and <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD44 (1, 24, 96 h p.i. of 37MBq, n=13). For all original images tissue volumes of interest (VOI) were defined. Manual delineation of complete organs (volume range 107-4377 mL) was used to obtain liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain VOI. Fixed size VOI of 2.1 and 8.6 mL were placed in aortic arch and lumbar vertebrae to sample blood pool and bone marrow, respectively. Next, original PET list mode data were split before reconstruction, simulating test-retest scans. All VOI were applied to these test-retest scans. Mean activity concentrations (AC) were derived from these VOI. Repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman plots (percentage difference versus mean activity concentration in Bq/mL, limits of agreement (LOA)), and repeatability coefficients (RC) were calculated (1.96xSD of the mean percentage difference). Result(s): Repeatability for all mAbs decreased with time. For <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD44 (18MBq), RCs were 8.0, 10.4 and 16.5% at 1, 24 and 96 h p.i., respectively. RCs for larger, manual VOIs were 7.2%, while RCs for smaller, fixed size VOIs were 28% at 96 h p.i. (Figure 1). For <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20 (18MBq)/<sup>89</sup>Zr-cetuximab (18MBq), RCs for all VOIs were 13.7/9.9, 17.9/14.9 and 26.1/24.6% at 1, 72 and 144 h p.i., respectively. For a higher injected dose, repeatability improved. For 37MBq of <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20, RCs were 8.2, 9.9 and 22.6% at 1, 72 and 144 hours p.i., respectively. Conclusion(s): For large, manually delineated tissue VOI a lower RC was obtained compared with smaller, fixed sized VOI. In general, RC of tissue uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb was around 15 and 25% for imaging at 72 and 144 h p.i., respectively.

2370,"Role of hippocampal location and radiation dose in glioblastoma patients with hippocampal atrophy Background: The hippocampus is a critical organ for irradiation. Thus, we explored changes in hippocampal volume according to the dose delivered and the location relative to the glioblastoma. Method(s): All patients were treated for glioblastoma with surgery, concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and adjuvant temozolomide. Hippocampi were retrospectively delineated on three MRIs, performed at baseline, at the time of relapse, and on the last MRI available at the end of follow-up. A total of 98, 96, and 82 hippocampi were measured in the 49 patients included in the study, respectively. The patients were stratified into three subgroups according to the dose delivered to 40% of the hippocampus. In the group 1 (n = 6), the hippocampal D<inf>40%</inf> was < 7.4 Gy, in the group 2 (n = 13), only the H<inf>contra</inf> D<inf>40%</inf> was < 7.4 Gy, and in the group 3 (n = 30), the D<inf>40%</inf> for both hippocampi was > 7.4 Gy. Result(s): Regardless of the time of measurement, homolateral hippocampal volumes were significantly lower than those contralateral to the tumor. Regardless of the side, the volumes at the last MRI were significantly lower than those measured at baseline. There was a significant correlation among the decrease in hippocampal volume regardless of its side, and D<inf>max</inf> (p = 0.001), D<inf>98%</inf> (p = 0.028) and D<inf>40%</inf> (p = 0.0002).

Conclusion(s): There was a significant relationship between the radiotherapy dose and decrease in hippocampal volume. However, at the lowest doses, the hippocampi seem to exhibit an adaptive increase in their volume, which could indicate a plasticity effect. Consequently, shielding at least one hippocampus by delivering the lowest possible dose is recommended so that cognitive function can be preserved. Trial registration Retrospectively registered.

Patients and Methods: 33 patients with brain metastases were included in the study and treated with TMZ 60 mg/m2/day (days 1-16) concomitantly with WBI (36 Gy/12 fractions given in 16 days). One month after the end of radiotherapy, 6 cycles of TMZ were administered as adjuvant treatment (200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days). Result(s): Responses were assessed using computed tomography at the end of the 3rd and 6th cycle of chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 54.5% and 57.6% after the 3rd and the 6th cycle, respectively. The median overall survival was 12 months. In patients with metastases from lung cancer the objective response rate was 11/14 (78.6%) after both the 3rd and the 6th cycle of treatment. The most common side effects were anemia (24.2%), thrombocytopenia (18.2%), as well as nausea and vomiting (18.2%). The high incidence of hepatotoxicity (45.5%) might be related to concomitantly administered antiepileptic drugs and not to TMZ. Conclusion(s): WBI combined with TMZ as concomitant and adjuvant treatment is effective in treating brain metastases, with acceptable mild side effects. © 2007 S. Karger GmbH.",Excluded
1308,"Zebrafish as a ""biosensor""? Effects of ionizing radiation and amifostine on embryonic viability and development The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a popular vertebrate model system for cancer and treatment-related research. Benefits include ease of care, rapid development, optical clarity of embryos, which allows visualization of major organ systems, and opportunities for genetic manipulation. However, specific parameters of radiation sensitivity have not been systematically documented. We investigated the effects of radiation and a radiomodifier on zebrafish viability and embryonic development. Embryos were exposed to gamma-radiation (5, 10, or 20 Gy) at sequential times postfertilization and serially assessed for viability and morphologic abnormalities. As expected, lethality and morphologic perturbations were more pronounced earlier in embryogenesis and with higher radiation doses and were partially reversed by amifostine. The effects of radiation and concurrent treatment with amifostine on the developmental organization of the eye and brain were striking. Radiation resulted in hypocellularity and disorganization of the cellular layers of the retina, effects partially reversed by amifostine, as well as lens opacification. Radiation strikingly reduced the volume of brain, but the volume loss was substantially blocked by amifostine. Increased terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling signal was noted in both the irradiated eye and brain, but reduced by amifostine. Finally, irradiating embryos resulted in caspase activation detectable in 96-well microplates, which was proportional to the number of embryos and radiation dose; the degree of activation was markedly reduced by amifostine. These results together suggest the power and versatility of the zebrafish in assessing the effects of radiation and radiomodifiers on organ and tissue development.",Excluded
1590,"Microglial cytokine gene induction after irradiation is affected by morphologic differentiation Microglia are known to play an important role in the CNS cytokine network, and their response after irradiation may be associated with the development of radiation-induced tissue damage. Radiation effects on this cytokine network have not yet been elucidated. We investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation on microglia stimulated with Zymosan A and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which alone induce the expression of some cytokines and neurotoxic products by microglial cells. In the resting condition (ramified microglia), radiation had no effect on the mRNA level corresponding to cytokines such as IL1beta or IL-6, although TGF-beta1 mRNA was minimally enhanced by irradiation. However, in the activated microglia (amoeboid microglia) stimulated with Zymosan A, radiation-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased about two-fold in comparison with non-irradiation. IL-1beta was slightly induced by 2 Gy irradiation, but was not induced by higher doses. TGF-beta1 mRNA was not enhanced by radiation following Zymosan stimulation. In the LPS-stimulated condition, IL-6 mRNA was induced only by 2 Gy of irradiation, but no change in the expression of other genes was detected. These results suggested that radiation exerted different effects on cytokine gene transcription in microglia depending on their morphological state.",Included
2432,"Structural MRI research in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following radiotherapy: A DTI and VBM study The aim of the present study was to investigate the microstructural characteristics of the brain lobes following radiotherapy (RT) for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) at distinct times.

The patients were divided into three groups, according to the time following completion of RT. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) volume were determined. The DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and the GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Compared with the pre-RT group, the mean FA values in the left parietal lobe white matter (WM) and right cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05). In addition, the mean FA values in the right parietal lobe WM decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05), compared with the pre-RT group. The FA level in the right temporal lobe remained significantly decreased, compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. Furthermore, compared with pre-RT group, the GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobe, right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and left cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05), and in the bilateral temporal lobe, parietal lobe, right frontal lobe and left cerebellum, the GM volume decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05). The GM volume in the right temporal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe and bilateral cerebellum remained significantly decreased compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT.

Method(s): Three shielding structures were designed to minimise the scattered and leaked radiation from various gantry angles and radiation scattering within the patient. The base-plate part that can be placed on the treatment couch was designed to reduce the scattered and leaked radiation generated at gantry angles located near 180degree. A body shielding part that can cover the lower chest and abdomen was designed, and a neck-shielding structure was added to reduce the internal and external radiation scattering from the treatment area. Evaluation plans were generated to assess the foetal dose reduction by the foetal shielding device in terms of the shielding material thickness, distance from the field edge, and shielding component using the flattened 6 MV photon beam (6MV) and flattening filter-free 6 MV photon beam (6MV-FFF). In addition, the effectiveness of the foetal shielding device was evaluated in a pregnant brain tumour patient. Result(s): The shielding material consisting of three parts was placed on frames composed of four arch shapes with a vertical curved structure, connection bar at the top position, and base plate. Each shielding part resulted in reductions in the radiation dose according to the treatment technique, as the thickness of the shielding material increased and the foetal dose decreased. In addition, a foetal dose reduction of approximately 50% was confirmed at 50 cm from the field edge by using the designed shielding device in most delivery techniques. In patients, the newly designed shielding structures can effectively eliminate up to about 49% of the foetal dose generated from various gantry angles used in VMAT or IMRT. Conclusion(s): We designed a foetal shielding device consisting of three parts to effectively reduce the dose delivered to the foetus, and evaluated the device with various treatment techniques for a pregnant patient with brain tumour. The foetal shielding device shielded the scattered/leaked radiation from the treatment machine, and also effectively reduced internal scattering from the treatment area in the patient.

Treatment with corticosteroids, surgery, and antioxidants is often ineffective.

Limitations are seen in its inability to identify small calcifications and to distinguish clearly perifocal oedema and tumour especially in malignant lesions. Relatively thick slices of 5-10 mm make the detection of microadenomas very difficult, mainly because of partial volume effects. T1 and T2 values alone are not sufficient to provide specific diagnosis. No reliable criteria have been determined yet, which would indicate the quality of pathological involvement of peritumorous structures by tumours of the sella region.

In the present study we asked whether tDCS applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1) also produces aftereffects distant from the site of the stimulating electrodes. We therefore tested corticospinal excitability in the left and the right M1 and transcallosal excitability between the two cortices using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after applying tDCS. Eight healthy subjects received 10 min of anodal or cathodal tDCS (1 mA) to the left M1. We examined the amplitude of contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the onset latency and duration of transcallosal inhibition with single pulse TMS. MEPs evoked from the tDCS stimulated (left) M1 were increased by 32% after anodal and decreased by 27% after cathodal tDCS, while transcallosal inhibition evoked from the left M1 remained unchanged. The effect on MEPs evoked from the left M1 lasted longer for cathodal than for anodal tDCS. MEPs evoked from the right M1 were unchanged whilst the duration of transcallosal inhibition evoked from the right M1 was shortened after cathodal tDCS and prolonged after anodal tDCS. The duration of transcallosal inhibition returned to control values before the effect on the MEPs from the left M1 had recovered. These findings are compatible with the idea that tDCS-induced aftereffects in the cortical motor system are limited to the stimulated hemisphere, and that tDCS not only affects corticospinal circuits involved in producing MEPs but also inhibitory interneurons mediating transcallosal inhibition from the contralateral hemisphere.",Excluded

Overall, we enrolled 108 participants, of which 40% were Black and 34% were Hispanic; the mean age was 62.3 years, and median pack-years of smoking was 26. We found that intention to screen was similar among minorities and non-minorities (p=0.19); however, Hispanics were less likely to report intention to screen if they had to pay for the test (p=0.02). Fatalistic beliefs, fear of radiation exposure, and anxiety related to CT scans were significantly associated with decreased intention to screen (p<0.05). Several differences were observed in minority versus non-minority participants' beliefs toward lung cancer and screening. In conclusion, we found that concerns about cost, which were particularly prominent among Hispanics, as well as fatalism and radiation exposure fears may constitute barriers to lung cancer screening. Lung cancer screening programs should address these factors to ensure broad participation, particularly among minorities.",Excluded
1425,"Dose response study of human exposure to 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields This human exposure study examined the relationship between field strength and biological response and tested whether the exposure levels at which the greatest effects occur differ for different endpoints. Three matched groups of 18 men each participated in two 6 h exposure test sessions. All subjects were sham exposed in one session. In the other session, each group of subjects was exposed at a different level of combined electric and magnetic field strength (low group:6 kV/m, 10 microT; medium group:9 kV/m, 20 microT; and high group: 12 kV/m, 30 microT). The study was performed double blind, with exposure order counterbalanced. Significant slowing of heart rate, as well as alternations in the latency and amplitude of event-related brain potential measures derived from the electro encephalogram (EEG), occurred in the group exposed to the 9 kV/m, 20 microT combined field (medium group). Exposure at the other field strength levels had no influence on cardiac measures and differential effects on EEG activity. Significant decrements in reaction time and in performance accuracy on a time estimation task were observed only in the low group. These results provide support for the hypothesis that humans may be more responsive to some combinations or levels of field strength than to others and that such differences in responsivity may depend, in part, on the endpoint of interest.",Excluded

1399,"Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Functional Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) Activity and Benefit of TGFbeta Inhibition in Irradiated Intracranial Tumors Purpose: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) promotes cell survival by endorsing DNA damage repair and mediates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, TGFbeta activation in response to radiation therapy is potentially targetable because it opposes therapeutic control. Strategies to assess this potential in the clinic are needed. Methods and Materials: We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) to image <sup>89</sup>Zr -fresolimumab, a humanized TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, as a means to detect TGFbeta activation in intracranial tumor models. Pathway activity of TGFbeta was validated by immunodetection of phosphorylated SMAD2 and the TGFbeta target, tenascin. The contribution of TGFbeta to radiation response was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of mice bearing intracranial murine tumor models GL261 and SB28 glioblastoma and brain-adapted 4T1 breast cancer (4T1-BrA) treated with TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 1D11, and/or focal radiation (10 Gy). Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detected engineered, physiological, and radiation-induced TGFbeta activation, which was confirmed by immunostaining of biological markers. GL261 glioblastoma tumors had a greater PET signal compared with similar-sized SB28 glioblastoma tumors, whereas the widespread PET signal of 4T1-BrA intracranial tumors was consistent with their highly dispersed histologic distribution. Survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors treated with 1D11 neutralizing antibody alone was similar to that of mice treated with control antibody, whereas 1D11 improved survival when given in combination with focal radiation. The extent of survival benefit of a combination of radiation and 1D11 was associated with the degree of TGFbeta activity detected by PET. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detects radiation-induced TGFbeta activation in tumors. Functional imaging indicated a range of TGFbeta activity in intracranial tumors, but TGFbeta blockade provided survival benefit only in the context of radiation treatment. This study provides further evidence that radiation-induced TGFbeta activity opposes therapeutic response to radiation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1658,"Five-year experience with combined operative and radiotherapeutic treatment of recurrent gynecologic tumors infiltrating the pelvic wall BACKGROUND: Whereas 25 to 50% of selected patients with gynecologic tumors who relapse centrally in an irradiated pelvis can be salvaged by exenteration, postirradiation recurrence infiltrating the pelvic side wall generally has been fatal. We have designed the combined operative and radiotherapeutic treatment (CORT) procedure for the treatment of postirradiation recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall and developed several new techniques for its realization. The aim of the surgery is as follows: (1) total resection of the tumor with only a microscopic margin (R1) at the pelvic wall, preserving the bony pelvis and the neurovascular support of the leg; (2) modulation of the therapeutic index for a second high-dose irradiation of the pelvic wall by transferring autologous tissue from the abdomen or the thigh, and (3) reconstruction of pelvic organ functions lost due to tumor resection. The tumor bed is irradiated postoperatively with brachytherapy through transcutaneous guide tubes implanted at the pelvic wall.METHODS: Between April 1989 and December 1994, we treated 48 patients with postirradiation recurrent or persistent gynecologic malignancies infiltrating the pelvic wall with CORT and followed them prospectively with the following endpoints: tumor control, survival, complications, and quality of life.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 3-71 months), the 5-year survival probability calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method was 44%. The overall local control rate was 68%, and 85% in the last 25 patients in the series. The censored severe complication rate at 5 years was 33%. No patient died as a consequence of the treatment. Quality of life was self-assessed with a validated questionnaire by 15 patients without evidence of disease, and was rated with a total of 74% of the maximum score points. Age of the patient, state of resection at the pelvic wall (R1 vs. R2), and recurrent tumor size independently influenced tumor progression after CORT in this series.CONCLUSIONS: CORT appears to be a feasible, innovative treatment with long term survival potential and acceptable quality of life for selected patients with postirradiation gynecologic tumor recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall. R1 resection of the tumor at the pelvic wall is mandatory; however, the reconstruction options within the pelvis are limited.",Excluded
1506,"AT cells are not radiosensitive for simple chromosomal exchanges at low dose Cells deficient in ATM (product of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia patients) or NBS (product of the gene mutated in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome) show increased yields of both simple and complex chromosomal aberrations after high doses (>0.5Gy) of ionizing radiation (X-rays or gamma-rays), however less is known on how these cells respond at low dose. Previously we had shown that the increased chromosome aberrations in ATM and NBS defective lines was due to a significantly larger quadratic dose-response term compared to normal fibroblasts for both simple and complex exchanges. The linear dose-response term for simple exchanges was significantly higher in NBS cells compared to wild type cells, but not for AT cells. However, AT cells have a high background level of exchanges compared to wild type or NBS cells that confounds the understanding of low dose responses. To understand the sensitivity differences for high to low doses, chromosomal aberration analysis was first performed at low dose-rates (0.5Gy/d), and results provided further evidence for the lack of sensitivity for exchanges in AT cells below doses of 1Gy. Normal lung fibroblast cells treated with KU-55933, a specific ATM kinase inhibitor, showed increased numbers of exchanges at a dose of 1Gy and higher, but were similar to wild type cells at 0.5Gy or below. These results were confirmed using siRNA knockdown of ATM. The present study provides evidence that the increased radiation sensitivity of AT cells for chromosomal exchanges found at high dose does not occur at low dose.",Excluded
2019,"Neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in a psychopathological animal model are suggestive of antidepressant-like effects The neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) were investigated in two rat lines selectively bred for high and low anxiety-related behavior. The stimulation parameters were adjusted according to the results of accurate computer-assisted and magnetic resonance imaging-based reconstructions of the current density distributions induced by rTMS in the rat and human brain, ensuring comparable stimulation patterns in both cases. Adult male rats were treated in two 3-day series under halothane anesthesia. In the forced swim test, rTMS-treatment induced a more active coping strategy in the high anxiety-related behavior rats only (time spent struggling; 332% vs. controls), allowing these animals to reach the performance of low anxiety-related behavior rats. In contrast, rTMS-treated low anxiety-related behavior rats did not change their swimming behavior. The development of active coping strategies in high anxiety-related behavior rats was accompanied by a significantly attenuated stress-induced elevation of plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations. In summary, the behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of rTMS of frontal brain regions in high anxiety-related behavior rats are comparable to the effects of antidepressant drug treatment. Interestingly, in the psychopathological animal model repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced changes in stress coping abilities in the high-anxiety line only.",Excluded
1709,"Red LED photobiomodulation reduces pain hypersensitivity and improves sensorimotor function following mild T10 hemicontusion spinal cord injury BACKGROUND: The development of hypersensitivity following spinal cord injury can result in incurable persistent neuropathic pain. Our objective was to examine the effect of red light therapy on the development of hypersensitivity and sensorimotor function, as well as on microglia/macrophage subpopulations following spinal cord injury.METHODS: Wistar rats were treated (or sham treated) daily for 30 min with an LED red (670 nm) light source (35 mW/cm(2)), transcutaneously applied to the dorsal surface, following a mild T10 hemicontusion injury (or sham injury). The development of hypersensitivity was assessed and sensorimotor function established using locomotor recovery and electrophysiology of dorsal column pathways. Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL were performed to examine cellular changes in the spinal cord.RESULTS: We demonstrate that red light penetrates through the entire rat spinal cord and significantly reduces signs of hypersensitivity following a mild T10 hemicontusion spinal cord injury. This is accompanied with improved dorsal column pathway functional integrity and locomotor recovery. The functional improvements were preceded by a significant reduction of dying (TUNEL(+)) cells and activated microglia/macrophages (ED1(+)) in the spinal cord. The remaining activated microglia/macrophages were predominantly of the anti-inflammatory/wound-healing subpopulation (Arginase1(+)ED1(+)) which were expressed early, and up to sevenfold greater than that found in sham-treated animals.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a simple yet inexpensive treatment regime of red light reduces the development of hypersensitivity along with sensorimotor improvements following spinal cord injury and may therefore offer new hope for a currently treatment-resistant pain condition.",Excluded
2095,"Radiation retinopathy after orbital irradiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy Recent reports indicate that orbital irradiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy is sometimes beneficial, particularly for dysthyroid optic neuropathy, and is not associated with serious complications. We are aware, however, of four patients who were found to have radiation retinopathy after orbital irradiation for Grave's ophthalmopathy. All four patients have decreased central acuity, and three of the four are legally blind in one or both eyes. Computer reconstruction of the dosimetry, based on computed tomography and beam profiles, shows that errors in dosage calculations and radiotherapy technique probably account for the radiation retinopathy in three of the four patients. Radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy should be administered only by competent radiotherapists who are experienced in the treatment of this disease. Similar errors in dosage calculations and treatment techniques may account for other reports of radiation retinopathy after reportedly safe dosages.",Excluded
2407,"Neuroprotective effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in mice through modulating mitochondrial dynamics Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of protein inclusions and the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis is thought to be important for the pathogenesis of PD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, constitutes a promising approach for promoting recovery of various neurological conditions. However, little is known about its mechanism of action. The present study elucidated the neuroprotective effects of tDCS on the mitochondrial quality control pathway in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. We used the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in vivo model. Mice were stimulated for 5 consecutive days with MPTP treatment. After observation of behavioral alteration using the rotarod test, mice were sacrificed for the measurement of the PD- and mitochondrial quality control-related protein levels in the substantia nigra. tDCS improved the behavioral alterations and changes in tyrosine hydroxylase levels in MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, tDCS attenuated mitochondrial damage, as indicated by diminished mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase activity in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model. MPTP significantly increased mitophagy and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins. These changes were attenuated by tDCS. Furthermore, MPTP significantly increased fission-related protein dynamin-related protein 1 with no effect on fusion-related protein mitofusin-2, and tDCS attenuated these changes. Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of anodal tDCS on the MPTP-induced neurotoxic mouse model through suppressing excessive mitophagy and balancing mitochondrial dynamics. The neuroprotective effect of anodal tDCS with modulation of mitochondrial dynamics provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.",Excluded
2240,"Comparison between dose values specified at the ICRU reference point and the mean dose to the planning target volume BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare dose values specified at the reference point, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, ICRU, and the mean dose to the planning target volume, PTV.MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT-based dose calculations were performed with a 3-D treatment planning system for 6 series of patients treated for bladder, brain, breast, lung, oropharynx and parotid gland tumour. All patients were arbitrarily chosen from a set of previously treated patients irradiated with a two- or three-field technique using customised blocks. Appropriate wedge angles and beam weights were chosen to make the dose distribution as homogeneous as possible.RESULTS: The dose at the ICRU reference point was generally higher than the mean dose to the PTV. The difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV for an individual patient was less than 3% in 88% of cases and less than 2% in 72% of the cases. The differences were larger in those patients where the dose distribution is significantly influenced by the presence of lungs or air gaps. For each series of patients the mean difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV was calculated. The difference between these two values never exceeded 2%. Because not all planning systems are able to calculate the mean dose to the PTV, the concept of the mean central dose, the mean of the dose values at the centre of the PTV in each CT slice, has been introduced. The mean central dose was also calculated for the same patients and was closer to the mean dose to the PTV than the ICRU reference dose.CONCLUSION: The mean dose to the PTV is well estimated by either the ICRU reference dose or the mean central dose for a variety of treatment techniques for common types of cancer.",Excluded
1327,"Relationship between acoustic pressure used for BBB disruption and amount of MRI contrast agent delivered to the brain Objectives: The acoustic intensity needs to be very well known to efficiently open the Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) since it is mainly ruled by the mechanical index [1]. Previous studies have shown that a narrow range of peak negative pressure (PNP) is acceptable, corresponding to sufficient stable cavitation of injected microbubbles without reaching inertial cavitation responsible for irreversible damages. Within this range, only few data are available about how the pressure affects the strength of BBB disruption that is to say the amount of delivered drugs. We propose two new methods to evidence the opening threshold in vivo and measure this relationship after a MRI controlled protocol of the BBB opening: 1) Several different pressures are used at several brain locations during the same BBB opening session 2) A single point focal opening is performed and the brain uptake of contrast agent is correlated in each voxel with the pressure estimated from a MR-acoustic radiation force image [2]. Methods We use our previously introduced motorized MR-compatible FUS sys-tem [3] (Image Guided Therapy, France). An 8 channel annular array transducer operating at 1.5MHz (Imasonic, France) was calibrated in a water tank and acoustic transmission factors through rat skulls were measured in another study. This ability to shrewdly control the pressure we deliver in vivo in the brain is crucial for the two proposed methods. Fisher F344 rats (n=5, body weight=220g) were shaved and installed in the MRI bed of a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker) under isoflurane anesthesia. The transducer was coupled to the head with echographic gel. In a first experiment, after intravenous injection of microbubbles (Sonovue), a square trajectory was played with the transducer continuously shooting. 4 different pressures (0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 MPa) were applied on the 4 sides of the square. The transducer was moving at 10 mm/s, the size of the square was 5 mm and the trajectory was played 60 times. Then a 200muL Gadolinium based MRI contrast agent (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was intravenously injected, at different time after the opening (10 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours), and its uptake into the brain was quantitatively measured thank to T<inf>1</inf> maps. In a second experiment, the BBB was focally open with 0.6 MPa peak negative pressure at focus. Before the opening session, an Acoustic Radiation Force Image was acquired in order to estimate in vivo the pressure applied in each voxel during the BBB opening. After the opening, Dotarem was intravenously injected and the contrast agent concentration was measured in each voxel by acquiring T<inf>1</inf> maps [4]. The concentration in each voxel is then correlated to the pressure which has been used in this voxel to open the BBB. Results The first experiment with the square trajectory gives a rough estimation of the pressure threshold. Indeed it appears clearly (see Fig. 130) that the BBB is not open on the 0.25 and 0.35 MPa sides while it is open on the 0.45 and 0.55 MPa sides. The acoustic threshold must be between 0.35 and 0.45 MPa. With the second injection, we also found that the BBB was already close as soon as 4 hours after the opening even for the 0.55 MPa region. The second experiment gives a more accurate estimation of the pressure threshold. By plotting the concentrations in contrast agent in the voxel versus the pressure used in these voxel to open the BBB (see Fig. 131), two trends are observables. In a first pressure range, from 0 to 0.4 MPa, the pressure is not sufficient to open the BBB so the concentration is not significant. In a higher pressure range, from 0.4 MPa to 0.6MPa, the pressure is sufficient to open the BBB and the concentration increases as the pressure increases in a roughly linear way. With this experiment the found pressure threshold is about 0.4 MPa. A third way of determining the opening threshold is to study the width of the opening on the sides [LB1] of the square of the first ex-periment. Indeed it is possible to plot the concentration profile across the lines of the opening and t compare it to the Gaussian profile of the pressure which has been studied in water tank. It appeared that the width where the BBB is open matches with the width on the Gaussian profile where the pressure is higher than 0.4 MPa. Conclusions The two different methods proposed for the study of the dependency of drug uptake after BBB disruption with acoustic pressure give consistent results. We find an acoustic pressure threshold for the BBB opening of 0.4 MPa, for a 1.5 MHz working frequency. This result is in good accordance with the literature [5]. By acquiring T2 weighted images after those experiments, we are confident we caused no damages up to 0.6 MPa. This pressure is close to the one for which adverse effects started to appear in our previous studies thought. As a consequence, the pressure window for a safe and efficient BBB opening is quite narrow which highlights that the pressure in vivo has to be very well controlled. [LB1] Above the opening threshold, the relationship between drug uptake and acoustic pressure is linear. The knowledge of this relationship is key in order to predict drug pharmacokinetics after BBB disruption.",Excluded
1725,"Oxidative stress and adult neurogenesis-Effects of radiation and superoxide dismutase deficiency Hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and in spatial navigation. Production of new neurons that are functionally integrated into the hippocampal neuronal network is important for the maintenance of functional plasticity. In adults, production of new neurons in the hippocampus takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. Neural progenitor/stem cells go through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation. This process is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress, and perturbation in the redox balance in the neurogenic microenvironment can lead to reduced neurogenesis. Cranial irradiation is an effective treatment for primary and secondary brain tumors. However, even low doses of irradiation can lead to persistent elevation of oxidative stress and sustained suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes for the removal of superoxide radicals in different subcellular compartments. To identify the subcellular location where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated after cranial irradiation, different SOD deficient mice have been used to determine the effects of irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. The study results suggest that, regardless of the subcellular location, SOD deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the production of new neurons in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus. In exchange, the generation of new glial cells was significantly increased. The SOD deficient condition, however, altered the tissue response to irradiation, and SOD deficient mice were able to maintain a similar level of neurogenesis after irradiation while wild type mice showed a significant reduction in the production of new neurons. © 2012.",Included

Due to the widespread usage of MW radiation, especially in our homes, it is essential to investigate the direct effect of MW radiation on the central nervous system. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the effect of MW radiation on memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The rats were exposed to 2.45 GHz MW radiation (continuous wave with overall average power density of 0.016 mW/cm2 and overall average whole-body specific absorption rate value of 0.017 W/kg) for 2 h/day over a period of 40 days. Spatial learning and memory were tested by radial maze and passive avoidance tests. We evaluated the synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neuronal cells number by field potential recording and Giemsa staining, respectively. Our results showed that MW radiation exposure decreased the learning and memory performance that was associated with decrement of long-term potentiation induction and excitability of CA1 neurons. However, MW radiation did not have any effects on short-term plasticity and paired-pulse ratio as a good indirect index for measurement of glutamate release probability. The evaluation of hippocampal morphology indicated that the neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 area was significantly decreased by MW.",Excluded
1670,"Ratiometric calcium concentration estimation using LED excitation during mechanotransduction in single sensory neurons In a previous study using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 fluorescence we found that intracellular calcium concentration in spider mechanoreceptor neurons rose during mechanical stimulation. We also showed that calcium elevation required the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels by action potentials, and could not be produced by the receptor potential alone. While evidence for mechanisms of calcium elevation in these neurons was clear, our estimates of actual calcium concentration depended on properties of the fluorescent dye in the neuron cytoplasm that could not be verified. We have now developed a method for ratiometric estimation of calcium concentration in these neurons using Fura Red dye, excitation by two light emitting diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths, and an avalanche photodiode fluorescence detector. The method is simple and economical to implement, allows concentration changes to be measured in the millisecond time range, and could easily be applied to a wide range of preparations.

CT (n=1) or MRI (n=66) images of 67 patients with a total of 437 treatment-naive brain metastases from breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped according to the biological subtype of the tumor [luminal A, 28; luminal B, 9; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive, 14; triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), 16]. All images were standardized to the human brain MRI atlas provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 database. The distribution pattern of brain metastases after image standardization was analyzed. The cerebellum and the frontal lobe were more commonly affected by breast cancer brain metastases. Brain metastases from luminal A and B types of breast cancer arose more often in the cerebellum. Brain metastases from HER2-positive type breast cancer occurred more often in the putamen and the thalamus and less frequently in the cerebellum than other types (P=0.0057). The subtypes of breast cancer are related to differences in the spatial distributions of their brain metastases.

Allowing for a transition period, the periods from January 2012 to August 2012 (Time Period 1) and February 2013 to July 2013 (Time Period 2) were analyzed for radiation exposure, contrast administration, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, angiographic results, and perioperative complications. Two neurointerventionalists (Group 1) used a conventional 2D roadmap for both Time Periods, and one neurointerventionalist (Group 2) transitioned from a 2D roadmap during Time Period 1 to a 3D overlay roadmap during Time Period 2.RESULTS: During Time Period 2, Group 2 demonstrated reduced fluoroscopy time (p<0.001), procedure time (P=0.023), total radiation dose (p=0.001), and fluoroscopy dose (P=0.017) relative to Group 1. During Time Period 2, there was no difference of immediate angiographic results and procedure complications between the two groups.

1781,"Experimental approaches to radiation-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain The developing mammalian brain is highly susceptible to ionizing radiation. Significant increases in microcephalus, heterotopic cortical gray matter, and mental retardation have been noted in prenatally exposed survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the highest risk in those exposed during 8-15 weeks after fertilization. This stage corresponds to day 15 of pregnancy for rats and day 13 for mice in terms of brain development. The initial damage produced by radiation at this stage is cell death in the ventricular zone of the brain mantle, the radiosensitive germinal cell population. Disturbances in the production of neuronal germinal cells, and their migration to the cerebral cortex, give rise to malformations of the brain, such as microcephalus, an absent corpus callosum, disorganized cortical architecture, and heterotopic gray matter. Histological abnormalities are produced by about 500 mGy or more, and reduced brain weight is produced by 250 mGy or more. Mitotic delay, on the other hand, in the ventricular cells is caused by 100 mGy or more. A similar threshold level is suggested in human cases in the induction of mental retardation. The lowest doses of X- and gamma-radiation that induce detectable biological effects in rats and mice are around 30 mGy in increasing acute cell death.",Excluded
1862,"The treatment options of recurred brain metastasis after prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with small-cell lung cancer Background: Even after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), many small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients succumb to brain metastasis. Brain metastasis after PCI is an unsolved issue in SCLC in terms of its dismal prognosis and the limitation of further treatment options. Regarding the treatment option, it is not determined whether re-whole brain radiotherapy (re-WBRT) is safe or gamma-knife surgery (GKS) has its role in SCLC. We investigated which treatment option could be recommended as the up-front therapy to improve survival for SCLC patients with brain metastasis who were previously treated with PCI. Method(s): The medical records were reviewed for SCLC patients who experienced brain metastases after receiving PCI from 2000 to 2010. We compared overall survival according to the modality of up-front therapy. Overall survival was determined as time from brain metastasis to death due to any cause. Result(s): In total, 245 patients had received PCI in a state of limited disease (n = 204) or extensive disease status (n = 41). Among them, 47 (19.2%) experienced brain metastases: 16.7% (34/204) in LD and 31.7% (13/41) in ED. At the time when brain metastasis developed, extracrainal disease was also on progressing state in 19 patients (40.4%). The modality of up-front therapy for brain metastasis was as follows: 17 (36.1%) got GKS, 14(29.8%) re-WBRT, 7 (14.9%) up-front chemotherapy without local therapy, and 9 (19.1%) did not receive any further treatment. The median overall survival after brain metastasis was 4.9 months. Among 31 patients who received GKS or re-WBRT, 10 patients received at least one subsequent chemotherapy in their lifetime after GKS (6/17, 35.3%) or re-WBRT (4/14, 28.6%). The median survival of GKS, re-WBRT and chemotherapy was 14.3, 3.9 and 6.0 months (P = 0.24), which showed the tendency favoring for up-front GKS. Although it failed to meet statistical significance. Conclusion(s): The up-front GKS showed longer survival in patients who experienced brain metastasis after PCI for SCLC, compared with re-WBRT or chemotherapy only. However, the number of participants was too small to get confirmatory results requiring a prospective therapy to demonstrate the role of GKS in this setting.",Excluded
1794,"Impact of therapeutic modalities on disease-specific survival in older adults with glioblastoma: A single-institution retrospective cohort study The standard first-line therapy for glioblastoma consists of maximal surgical resection, followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Optimal management for older glioblastoma patients is unknown as they have not been extensively studied in clinical trials. We report data from a series of 156 consecutive glioblastoma patients treated at our institution from 2007 to 2017. Compared to glioblastoma patients aged 70 or less, the patients older than 70 were less likely to undergo surgical resection (34% vs. 64%; p = 0.0003), be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (37% vs. 59%; p = 0.01) or radiation therapy (36% vs. 56%; p = 0.03). Disease-specific survival was significantly shorter in this age group (4.7 vs. 15.3 months; p = 0.002). Nonetheless, when older patients did undergo surgery or chemotherapy, the proportional improvement in cancer-specific survival was similar to the one recorded in younger patients, which is concordant with the findings of other published reports. A multidisciplinary input from neurosurgeons, medical and radiation oncologists, oncology pharmacists and geriatricians remain paramount for the optimal management of glioblastoma in patients older than 70.

2265,"Effective techniques for reduction of radiation dosage to patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures The goal of this study was to improve radiation dose reduction techniques in invasive cardiology and after patients' radiation data had approached minimal levels, to evaluate predictors of their radiation exposure resulting from invasive cardiac procedures. Over the course of 1 year (and 1996 procedures) we minimized cinegraphic frames and runs, as well as fluoroscopy time, and trained ourselves to achieve effective fluoroscopy-saving positioning of blinds and filters toward the regions of interest. We were consequently able to reduce the mean dose-area products (DAP) for coronary angiography and angioplasty, combined interventions, high-frequency rotational atherectomy, and excimer laser angioplasty: from levels of 53.9 Gy cm(2), 79.6 Gy cm(2), 112.3 Gy cm(2), 119.4 Gy cm(2), and 168.0 Gy cm(2) as currently reported in the literature, to 12.9 Gy cm(2), 13.3 Gy cm(2), 25.9 Gy cm(2), 33.0 Gy cm(2), and 27.1 Gy cm(2), respectively. The mean DAP due to interventions in acute myocardial infarction was 38.3 Gy cm(2). DAP was influenced by body mass index, complexity of coronary artery disease, tube angulation, documented structure, coronary recanalization, emergency circumstances, and the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) target vessel involved, but not by stent implantation. By favouring radiation-reducing cranial posteroanterior views over standard left anterior oblique views for visualization of the left anterior descending and the diagonal artery, we consequently achieved mean PTCA-DAPs of 10.4 Gy cm(2) and 8.6 Gy cm(2), respectively: levels significantly lower than those for PTCA of the right coronary artery (13.3 Gy cm(2)), left circumflex artery (13.7 Gy cm(2)), and obtuse marginal branch (16.9 Gy cm(2)).

1438,"Combination of pGL1-TNF-alpha gene and radiation (proton and gamma-ray) therapy against brain tumor The major goal of this study was to determine if treatment with the newly constructed plasmid vector for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (pGL1-TNF-alpha) could enhance the radiation-induced growth reduction of C6 rat glioma. In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment. Overall, the results suggest that the pGL1-TNF-alpha/radiation combination is effective and safe under the conditions employed. This is the first study to combine gene and proton radiation therapy and to show, under controlled experimental conditions, that proton radiation may have a greater effect against malignant tumors compared to the same physical dose of gamma-radiation.",Excluded

1339,"Electrically evoked GABA release in rat hippocampus CA1 region and its changes during kindling epileptogenesis Previous findings on changes in K+-induced GABA release from hippocampal slices during kindling epileptogenesis were reinvestigated using physiological electrical stimulation. For that purpose, a procedure was developed enabling neurochemical monitoring of GABA release locally in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices upon tetanic stimulation of Schaffer-collateral fibers. In the presence of a GABA reuptake blocker, subsequent application of short (3 s) pulses of 50-Hz stimuli induced a local transient increase in GABA release. In slices from fully kindled animals, 24 h after the last generalized seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release was increased in comparison to control slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, 4-5 weeks after the last seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release had returned to control levels. Application of the broad low-affinity GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen increased the tetanically stimulated GABA release in control slices, but had no effect in fully kindled slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, however, saclofen enhanced GABA release similarly as in control slices. We conclude that the transient increase in tetanus-induced GABA release during kindling epileptogenesis is seizure-related, and probably caused by temporarily impaired presynaptic GABAB receptors. The possible relevance of this finding for GABA transmission in epilepsy is discussed.",Excluded

In 1 to 14% of the patients delayed reaction may develop corresponding to the late radiation necrosis, usually with progressive unfavourable course. A problem of practical importance is the impossibility of differentiating radiation-induced cerebral necrosis from recurrence, expansion of the primary tumour or metastatic tumour, even using CT and MNR.

1799,"Intraoperative ISO-C C-arm navigation surgery for spinal and pelvic trauma Introduction: In patients with spinal or pelvic injuries caused by high-energy trauma, reconstructive surgery is performed so as to prevent complications and achieve early rehabilitation. Siremobil Iso- C3D (Siemens, Germany) is a mobile C-arm (Iso-C) that can reconstruct 3D images and allow surgeons to perform navigation surgery more accurately and quickly through the intraoperative evaluation of the 3D anatomy. Intraoperative use of fluoroscopy can therefore be reduced, minimizing radiation exposure to patients and medical staff. This report discusses the usefulness and safety of navigation surgery using Iso-C performed on patients with spinal or pelvic trauma. Subjects and methods: Two hundred and ninty patients with spinal or pelvic injuries who received instrumentation surgery using both Iso-C and a navigation system were recruited as subjects (131 with cervical spinal injuries, 126 with thoracolumbar spinal injuries, and 33 with pelvic trauma). All subjects received implants intraoperatively based on 3D images obtained using Iso-C. Screws used included the following: 1,435 pedicle (553 for the cervical spine and 882 for the thoracolumbar spine), 86 cervical lateral mass, 6 odontoid, 112 iliac, and 10 iliosacral. Accuracy of screw insertion was postoperatively evaluated with thin-slice CT (1.25 mm thickness). Grade 1 was assigned to screws that were correctly inserted within the bone cortex. Grade 2 was assigned to those where the screw thread penetrated through the bone cortex but where the deviation was less than 2 mm, while grade 3 was assigned to those for which the deviation was greater than 2 mm. Intraoperative radiation exposure time was also recorded. Result(s): No complications such as neurovascular damage were associated with surgery. Postoperative CT evaluation of the accuracy of screw insertion revealed that grades 2 and 3, were only observed with pedicle screws. For the cervical spine, 10 and 4 screws were defined as grades 2 and 3, respectively, while for the thoracolumbar spine, 22 and 7 were respectively categorized as grades 2 and 3. The rate of faulty insertions was 2.9% for pedicle screws. The average radiation exposure time needed to obtain intraoperative 3D images was 2.2 min. Discussion and conclusion: Reconstructive surgery for spinal or pelvic trauma is likely to be performed urgently and requires secure initial fixation. Computer navigation systems improve the accuracy of surgical procedures by functioning as surgeons' ''second eyes,'' and can be applied during urgent surgery. Moreover, these systems can reduce radiation exposure and thus increase the safety of patients and medical staff.",Excluded
1713,"Progressive and reproducible focal cortical ischemia with or without late spontaneous reperfusion generated by a ring-shaped, laser-driven photothrombotic lesion in rats Clinical stroke is mostly of thromboembolic origin, in which the magnitude of brain damage resulting from arterial occlusions depends on the degree and duration of the concomitant ischemia. To facilitate more controllable and reproducible study of stroke-related pathophysiological mechanisms, a photothrombotic ring stroke model was initially developed in adult rats. The ring interior zone comprises an anatomically well confined cortical region-at-risk which is gradually encroached by progressive hypoperfusion, thus mimicking the situation (albeit in inverse fashion) of an ischemic penumbra or stroke-in-evolution. Modification of this model using a thinner ring irradiation beam resulted in late spontaneous reperfusion in the cortical region-at-risk and a remarkable morphological tissue recovery in this ostensibly critically injured region. On the other hand, doubling the thin irradiating beam intensity facilitates a complementary situation in which lack of reperfusion in the region-at-risk after stroke induction leads to tissue pannecrosis. The dual photothrombotic ring stroke model, effectuated either with or without reperfusion and thereby tissue recovery or pannecrosis, may be well suited for the study of events related to postischemic survival or cell death in the penumbra region. To popularize the photothrombotic ring stroke model, we present a detailed protocol of how this model is induced in either version as well as protocols for transcardial carbon black perfusion and laser-Doppler flowmetry experiments. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

Current clinical opinion is based on a total of less than 20 published cases and suggests that gross total resection and long-term follow-up monitoring, with possible additional surgery and radiotherapy for treatment of recurrent tumors, represent the best treatment approach for this relatively benign tumor type. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presented with worsening unsteady gait and headaches, suggesting increased intracranial pressure. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent subtotal resection of a cerebellar liponeurocytoma, followed by fractionated radiotherapy (total dose of 54 Gy). She experienced a local recurrence of the tumor 12 months later and underwent additional surgery for removal of the cerebellar mass. A second recurrent tumor was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging scans 3 months later and was surgically resected. The tumor histological findings were consistently devoid of atypical features, apart from leptomeningeal invasion noted in the first surgical specimen.

The incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men following radical prostatectomy has been estimated to range from 16% to 82%. Several factors determine the postoperative incidence of erectile difficulties; these include patient age, degree of cavernosal nerve sparing during surgery, cancer stage, and associated comorbidities. Early initiation of available treatments after radical prostatectomy, such as phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and intracavernosal alprostadil, may improve the speed and degree of recovery of erectile function. Oral PDE-5 inhibitors are recognized as the first line of therapy for men with ED after radical prostatectomy, with reasonable success rates reported for all commercially available PDE-5 inhibitors.

1292,"Role for ATM in DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar ataxia, radiosensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint defects, and cancer predisposition. The gene product [ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM)] mutated in this syndrome is a component of the DNA damage detection pathway. Loss of ATM function in human and mouse cells causes defects in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control and, not surprisingly, humans and mice with compromised ATM function are prone to cancers. An excess of breast cancer in the relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia patients has also been reported by epidemiological studies. Predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers is also observed in women with germline mutations in BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene. BRCA1 is a nuclear protein with a cell cycle-regulated expression pattern and is hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA-damaging agents. Here we show that rapid ionizing radiation-induced in vivo phosphorylation of BRCA1 requires the presence of functional ATM protein. Furthermore, we show that ATM interacts with BRCA1, and this association is enhanced by radiation. We also demonstrate that BRCA1 is a substrate of ATM kinase in vitro and in vivo. Using phospho-specific antibodies against serines 1387, 1423, and 1457 of BRCA1, we demonstrate radiation-induced, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 at these sites. These findings show that BRCA1 is regulated by an ATM-dependent mechanism as a part of the cellular response to DNA damage. This interaction between ATM and BRCA1 argues in favor of the involvement of particular aspects of ATM function in breast cancer predisposition.",Excluded

2167,"Persistent calcium current in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons The suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the primary circadian clock, and suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons exhibit a diurnal modulation of spontaneous firing rate. The present study examined the voltage-gated persistent Ca(2+) current, in acutely isolated rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons using a ramp-type voltage-clamp protocol. Slow triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -85 mV to +5 mV elicited inward current (100-400 pA) that was completely blocked by Cd(2+). This current showed little or no hysteresis, and was identified as persistent Ca(2+) current. The threshold for persistent Ca(2+) current ranged between -60 and -45 mV, and it was maximal at about -8 mV. Nifedipine at 10-20 microM blocked 80-100%. To assess the role of persistent Ca(2+) current in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in both acutely isolated and intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons, the effect of Cd(2+) and nifedipine on firing rate was studied using on-cell recording. Application of Cd(2+) exerted a weak excitatory effect and nifedipine had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing rate of isolated suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. In all intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations (n=15), Cd(2+) slowly inhibited spontaneous firing; in high-frequency firing cells (four of 15), a transient increase of firing rate preceded inhibition. No significant effect of nifedipine on firing rate of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons was found. Therefore, persistent Ca(2+) current itself (as carrier of charge) does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous firing of suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. A slowly developing inhibitory effect of Cd(2+) on spontaneous firing of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations may be due to penetration of Cd(2+) through Ca(2+) channels, and its subsequent effect on intracellular mechanisms, while the transient increase of firing rate in high-frequency firing neurons is probably due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current.",Excluded

Each patient underwent a series of 9 whole-body scans at 30 minutes (prevoid) and 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, and 168 h. The organs included in dosimetric calculation were kidney, liver, spleen, pituitary gland, and NETs. All dosimetric calculations were done using the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. RESULT(S): Physiological uptake of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE was seen in all patients in kidneys, liver, spleen, and pituitary gland. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated: 0.57 +/- 0.09 mGy/MBq for kidneys, 0.27 +/- 0.05 mGy/MBq for liver, 1.17 +/- 0.14 mGy/MBq for spleen, 0.058 +/- 0.011 mGy/MBq for pituitary gland, and 3.41 +/- 0.68 mGy/MBq for NETs. CONCLUSION(S): The maximum cumulative activity of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE that can be safely administered to a patient within permissible renal threshold in our study was found to be 40 GBq (1100 mCi). However, there are considerable interpatient differences in absorbed doses of all organs requiring individualized dosimetry for optimizing tumor dose.",Excluded
1491,"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated is not required for p53 induction and apoptosis in irradiated epithelial tissues The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (Atm) protein kinase is a central regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage. Although Atm can regulate p53, it is not known if this Atm function varies between tissues. Previous studies showed that the induction of p53 and apoptosis by whole-body ionizing radiation varies greatly between tissue and tumor types, so here we asked if Atm also had a tissue-specific role in the ionizing radiation response. Irradiated Atm-null mice showed impaired p53 induction and apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and brain. In contrast, radiation-induced p53, apoptosis, phosphorylation of Chk2, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest were slightly delayed in Atm(-/-) epithelial cells of the small intestine but reached wild-type levels by 4 h. Radiation-induced p53 and apoptosis in Atm(-/-) hair follicle epithelial cells were not impaired at any of the time points examined. Thus, Atm is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues but is largely dispensable in epithelial cells. This indicates that marked differences in DNA damage signaling pathways exist between tissues, which could explain some of the tissue-specific phenotypes, especially tumor suppression, associated with Atm deficiency.",Excluded
2323,"Proposed mechanism for reduced jugular vein flow in microgravity Internal jugular flow is reduced in space compared with supine values, which can be associated with internal jugular vein (IJV) thrombosis. The mechanism is unknown but important to understand to prevent potentially serious vein thromboses on long duration flights. We used a novel, microgravity-focused numerical model of the cranial vascular circulation to develop hypotheses for the reduced flow. This model includes the effects of removing hydrostatic gradients and tissue compressive forces - unique effects of weightlessness. The IJV in the model incorporates sensitivity to transmural pressure across the vein, which can dramatically affect resistance and flow in the vein. The model predicts reduced IJV flow in space. Although tissue weight in the neck is reduced in weightlessness, increasing transmural pressure, this is more than offset by the reduction in venous pressure produced by the loss of hydrostatic gradients and tissue pressures throughout the body. This results in a negative transmural pressure and increased IJV resistance. Unlike the IJV, the walls of the vertebral plexus are rigid; transmural pressure does not affect its resistance and so its flow increases in microgravity. This overall result is supported by spaceflight measurements, showing reduced IJV area inflight compared with supine values preflight. Significantly, this hypothesis suggests that interventions that further decrease internal IJV pressure (such as lower body negative pressure), which are not assisted by other drainage mechanisms (e.g. gravity), might lead to stagnant flow or IJV collapse with reduced flow, which could increase rather than decrease the risk of venous thrombosis.

1989,"Randomized trial of standard pain control with or without gabapentin for pain related to radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer OBJECTIVE: Radiation-induced mucositis (RIM) in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for head and neck cancer (HNC) causes severe pain and worsens CRT compliance, QOL and outcome. Following retrospective reports, we conducted a randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of gabapentin for RIM-associated pain during CRT.METHODS: HNC patients (pts) receiving CRT were randomized to standard pain control (SPC) with acetaminophen and opioids, or SPC plus gabapentin (SPC+G). Gabapentin was maintained at 900mg/day for 4 weeks after CRT. Primary endpoint was maximum visual analogue scale (VAS) score during CRT, and secondary endpoints were total opioid dose, changes in QOL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HN 35) from baseline to 4 weeks after CRT, and adverse events.RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible Stage III or IV pts were randomly assigned to SPC or SPC+G (n=11 each). Twelve were treated in a locally advanced setting and 10 in a postoperative setting. Median maximum VAS scores, median total dose of opioids at maximum VAS and total dose of opioids at 4 weeks after CRT tended to be higher in the SPC+G arm (47 in SPC vs. 74 in SPC+G, p=0.517; 215mg vs. 745.3mg, p=0.880; and 1260mg vs. 1537.5mg, p=0.9438, respectively), without significance. QOL analysis showed significantly worse scores in the SPC+G arm for weight gain (p=0.005). Adverse events related to gabapentin were manageable.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study is the first prospective randomized trial of gabapentin for RIM-related pain. Gabapentin had no apparent beneficial effect. Further research into agents for RIM-related pain is warranted.",Excluded

We report two cases of adults with refractory aggressive behaviour due to a neurological condition (one mainly with self-inflicted behaviour) with dramatic response to therapy with allopurinol, 300 mg/day p.o. These preliminary results reinforce the involvement of the purinergic system in the neurobiology of aggression, warranting further testing of allopurinol as a new treatment for aggressive and self-inflicted behaviours.",Excluded
1747,"The susceptibility of the retina to photochemical damage from visible light The photoreceptor/RPE complex must maintain a delicate balance between maximizing the absorption of photons for vision and retinal image quality while simultaneously minimizing the risk of photodamage when exposed to bright light. We review the recent discovery of two new effects of light exposure on the photoreceptor/RPE complex in the context of current thinking about the causes of retinal phototoxicity. These effects are autofluorescence photobleaching in which exposure to bright light reduces lipofuscin autofluorescence and, at higher light levels, RPE disruption in which the pattern of autofluorescence is permanently altered following light exposure. Both effects occur following exposure to visible light at irradiances that were previously thought to be safe. Photopigment, retinoids involved in the visual cycle, and bisretinoids in lipofuscin have been implicated as possible photosensitizers for photochemical damage. The mechanism of RPE disruption may follow either of these paths. On the other hand, autofluorescence photobleaching is likely an indicator of photooxidation of lipofuscin. The permanent changes inherent in RPE disruption might require modification of the light safety standards. AF photobleaching recovers after several hours although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet clear. Understanding the mechanisms of phototoxicity is all the more important given the potential for increased susceptibility in the presence of ocular diseases that affect either the visual cycle and/or lipofuscin accumulation. In addition, knowledge of photochemical mechanisms can improve our understanding of some disease processes that may be influenced by light exposure, such as some forms of Leber's congenital amaurosis, and aid in the development of new therapies. Such treatment prior to intentional light exposures, as in ophthalmic examinations or surgeries, could provide an effective preventative strategy.",Excluded
1272,"Anti-VEGF treatment improves neurological function and augments radiation response in NF2 schwannoma model Hearing loss is the main limitation of radiation therapy for vestibular schwannoma (VS), and identifying treatment options that minimize hearing loss are urgently needed. Treatment with bevacizumab is associated with tumor control and hearing improvement in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients; however, its effect is not durable and its mechanism of action on nerve function is unknown. We modeled the effect anti-VEGF therapy on neurological function in the sciatic nerve model and found that it improves neurological function by alleviating tumor edema, which may further improve results by decreasing muscle atrophy and increasing nerve regeneration. Using a cranial window model, we showed that anti-VEGF treatment may achieve these effects via normalizing the tumor vasculature, improving vessel perfusion, and delivery of oxygenation. It is known that oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer; therefore, we further demonstrated that combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy can achieve a better tumor control and help lower the radiation dose and, thus, minimize radiation-related neurological toxicity. Our results provide compelling rationale for testing combined therapy in human VS.",Excluded
2218,"Risk analysis of the mortality from the diseases of the circulatory system in the ural cohort of emergency-irradiated population for the years 1950-2015. [Russian] The paper describes for the first time the results of the radiation effect study using the example of the analysis of circulatory system disease mortality in newly established cohort combining the population exposed in 1950-1960 due to 2 radiation incidents in the Southern Urals (the Techa River and East-Urals radioactive Trace). The cohort consists of 60,205 people. Over a 65-year follow up period 14,830 deaths from all diseases of the circulatory system were registered. Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence. The obtained results are in good agreement with those received in the analysis of the effect in the Techa River Cohort in 2013. The latter covered a 53-year period (with minimum latent period of 15 years) and revealed statistically significant linear dose response for all diseases of the circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy - 0.036) and ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy - 0.056).

1686,"Intracranial hyperthermia through local photothermal heating with a fiberoptic microneedle device BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The fiberoptic microneedle device (FMD) seeks to leverage advantages of both laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to increase volumetric dispersal of locally infused chemotherapeutics through sub-lethal photothermal heat generation. This study focused on determination of photothermal damage thresholds with 1,064 nm light delivered through the FMD into in vivo rat models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDs capable of co-delivering laser energy and fluid agents were fabricated through a novel off-center splicing technique involving fusion of a multimode fiberoptic to light-guiding capillary tubing. FMDs were positioned at a depth of 2.5 mm within the cerebrum of male rats with fluoroptic temperature probes placed within 1 mm of the FMD tip. Irradiation (without fluid infusion) was conducted at laser powers of 0 (sham), 100, 200, 500, or 750 mW. Evans blue-serum albumin conjugated complex solution (EBA) and laser energy co-delivery were performed in a second set of preliminary experiments.RESULTS: Maximum, steady-state temperatures of 38.7 +/- 1.6 and 42.0 +/- 0.9 degreeC were measured for the 100 and 200 mW experimental groups, respectively. Histological investigation demonstrated needle insertion damage alone for sham and 100 mW irradiations. Photothermal damage was detected at 200 mW, although observable thermal damage was limited to a small penumbra of cerebral cortical microcavitation and necrosis that immediately surrounded the region of FMD insertion. Co-delivery of EBA and laser energy presented increased volumetric dispersal relative to infusion-only controls.CONCLUSION: Fluoroptic temperature sensing and histopathological assessments demonstrated that a laser power of 100 mW results in sub-lethal brain hyperthermia, and the optimum, sub-lethal target energy range is likely 100-200 mW. The preliminary FMD-CED experiments confirmed the feasibility of augmenting fluid dispersal using slight photothermal heat generation, demonstrating the FMD's potential as a way to increase the efficacy of CED in treating MG.",Excluded

The lesion and control groups, however, did not evidence differences in pain sensitivity as measured by the flinch-jump technique. On the other hand, of the animals tested, those with M (n equal to 3) and DM (n equal to 4) lesions required more trials than controls (n equal to 6) to acquire a one-way avoidance response. D lesion rats (n equal to 2) did not differ from controls in one-way avoidance learning, except in terms of prolonged escape latencies during the first three trials. The previously reported increased sensitivity to painful stimuli subsequent to medial forebrain bundle lesions or para-chlorophenylalanine administration, therefore, does not appear to be due exclusively to disruption of ascending 5-HT fibers originating in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. The effects of midbrain raphe lesions of avoidance learning, furthermore, depend on lesion locus, and are not due to either hypo- or hyperalgesia.",Excluded
2060,"Intraventricular glioblastoma-A rare localization of a common intracerebral tumor Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents approx. 25% of all intracranial tumors in adults and is the most common primary brain tumor. In two thirds of cases, is the frontotemporal region affected, although this tumor can occur anywhere in the central nervous system. The intraventricular region as primary localization is extremely rare and only 29 cases have been reported, so far. Surgical gross total resection with concomitant radiation and chemotherapy is the standard therapy for best survival. Methods We report on six cases of histologically confirmed intraventricular GBM's who underwent biopsy or subtotal tumor resection at our department and were admitted between December 2015 and May 2016. Results All six cases with intraventricular mass underwent at least tumor biopsy to confirm the histology of GBM. The mean age was 58.2 +/- 15.7 years, the youngest patient was 26 years old. In terms of gender, there were 4 males and 2 females involved. The main clinical manifestations were neuropsychological deficits with personality changes, memory disorders and fatigue. Three patients presented with paresis, and one was symptomatic with headache and diffuse body pain. One patient presented with a fulminant loss of consciousness and was treated on the ICU for several days with an EVD. Four patients underwent biopsy only and two patients underwent craniotomy and subtotal tumor resection. All lesions were localized in the body of the lateral ventricle, in one case in the anterior horn, in another case in the central part of the lateral ventricle and in two cases in the posterior horn and the trigone. In the remaining two cases the tumor was found in the body of the inferior horn. The 2 patients who underwent surgery had the GBM localized in the posterior and the inferior horn and a parietooccipital approach over the trigone was used. Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy followed in 4 patients. Conclusion Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor, but the intraventricular localization is very rare and has a rather poor prognosis due to the fact, that gross total resection mostly can not be achieved. Surgical removal might be attempted only if subtotal resection can be achieved.",Excluded

1470,"Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) using modulated arc (MARC) IMRT for recurrent gliomas: Initial clinical outcomes of a novel technique Introduction: Limited salvage options exist for patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors after standard treatment. Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) is a biologically-unique strategy that lowers the effective dose rate, potentially decreasing toxicity by allowing for greater sublethal damage repair in normal tissue. It has been shown to be safe and effective in patients with recurrent gliomas using a 3DRT technique. We developed a novel technique using PRDR with modulated arc (mARC) IMRT delivery to further reduce the amount of normal tissue exposed. We report our initial clinical results using mARC PRDR in patients with previously-irradiated recurrent gliomas. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all brain tumor patients treated with mARC PRDR at our Institution. All mARC PRDR plans were generated with Monaco (Elekta Inc) using 1/10 of the total prescription dose. For each treatment fraction a total of 10 identical treatment beams were delivered with a minimum time interval of 3 min between beam initiations. This technique allows for the entire treatment volume to receive exactly 1/10 of the prescription dose every 3 min while limiting the prescription dose rate to less than 0.0667 Gy/min. Result(s): A total of 34 patients were treated with mARC PRDR. Primary histology included grade 2 (nZ6), grade 3 (nZ10), and grade 4 (nZ15) gliomas. Median dose at initial RT was 60 Gy (range 48 e 70) at 1.8 e 2 Gy per fraction. Patients were heavily pre-treated with a mean of 3 prior recurrences (range 1 e 7) before PRDR. Nineteen patients had repeat resection at recurrence including 6 just prior to PRDR. Bevacizumab was previously given to 16 patients with 26 patients receiving bevacizumab while undergoing PRDR (dose 10 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg q2 weeks). All patients had a KPS of 70 or greater. Mean age at PRDR was 53 (range 3 e 71). Median interval between initial RT and PRDR was 4.75 years (range 0.5 e 18.3). Median total dose was 54 Gy (range 30 e 60) at 2 Gy per fraction. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 months (range 0.5 - 19.3), 6-month OS was 70.5% and 1-year was OS 23.5%. Median time to progression was 6 months with 6-month PFS 47% and 1-year PFS 17.6%. Five of the 34 patients did not finish treatment due to clinical decline and/or tumor progression. No acute G3 toxicities were seen from PRDR. Conclusion(s): This is the first clinical report of mARC IMRT PRDR for recurrent gliomas.

MRIs were analyzed for presence of restricted diffusion, time to onset, pattern/location, duration of restriction, and persistence of restriction post-treatment with BEV.RESULTS: Patchy confluent areas of diffusion restriction on MRI were found in 12 patients. All 12 patients received radiation therapy followed by BEV therapy. Diffusion restriction appeared 3 to 21 months after onset of radiation and 1 to 6 months after starting BEV therapy, increased in size over time, and persisted up to 23 months while on BEV. Restricted diffusion was observed in areas that received 60 Gy or more of radiation. Areas of restricted diffusion showed low T1 and increased T2 signal intensity, minimal or no contrast enhancement, and low cerebral blood volume. A thin perimeter of susceptibility outlined the restricted areas on susceptibility-weighted images in nine patients (75%). Small focal areas of tumor recurrence within larger regions of restricted diffusion were evident in only four patients (33%). In seven patients (58%) the area of restricted diffusion showed necrosis or radiation change on histology or no metabolic activity on MR spectroscopy or PET.CONCLUSION: Restricted diffusion associated with BEV-treated cerebral gliomas occurs in regions of high-dose radiation and does not indicate high-cellularity of tumor recurrence.",Excluded

2223,"Higher seizure susceptibility in rats with cortical dysplasia: A feedback systems perspective Rationale: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is one of the leading causes of drug resistant focal epilepsy. Despite significant advances in various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the basic mechanisms of higher susceptibility for seizures in patients with CD remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical framework using principles from second order system dynamics to further characterize the effect of a ""second hit"" [acute single pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure] in animal model of in utero radiation-induced CD as compared to a PTZ induced seizure in normal control rat. Method(s): CD was induced through in utero irradiation of 4 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats at E17 with 145 cGy. Fourteen litters (XRT) were implanted with intracortical depth electrodes targeting the right and left frontal and parietal cortex. A set of 27 aged matched normal rats served as controls. All rats were injected with PTZ at 40 mg/kg. Post PTZ injection, all 14 XRT rats developed seizures (Group 1), 17 out of 27 normal rats developed seizures (Group 2) and in 10 normal rats, PTZ injection failed to induce seizures (Group 3). The flow diagram of experimental steps involved is provided in Fig. 1A. To characterize the response of the abnormal/normal brain to PTZ, the average gamma coherence (Cr) across all pairs of electrode and across all rats within a group was computed for the entire duration of recording (24 hours). The Cr profile can be viewed as the impulse response of an over-damped 2nd order system (See Fig.1C), the impulse function being the PTZ injection. The system parameters can then be estimated by fitting Eq.1 to Cr. Result(s): Fig. 1B shows Cr profile and the fitted data for the 3 groups of rats. Table 1, shows the location of poles s1, s2, the under-damped natural frequency (omegan) and the damping ratio of the system (xi). The slow pole s1 represents the long-term effects of the PTZ injection whereas the fast pole s2 dictates the immediate reaction of the system to external perturbation. Note that the slow pole is similar across the 3 groups (Fig. 1D). The location of the pole represents the stability of the system. The location of fast pole is closest to the imaginary axes for XRT rats and hence is suggestive of a less stable system. The lowest damping ratio is for the XRT rat, followed by rats in Group 2 and Group 3. A high damping ratio indicates that the system is resistive to oscillations caused by external perturbations. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that there exists an internal feedback mechanism within the brain of normal rats which reduces its susceptibility to epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that this feedback control mechanism is dysfunctional within the dysplastic (CD) rat brain. Support for this claim is provided by the relatively lower damping ratio and location of the fast pole of the CD rats (p<0.01). Translation of this concept to human studies using neurostimulation paradigms may provide a novel methodology to characterize and measure epileptogenicity in abnormal/normal tissues. Our future work will be targeted along these lines. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

Surgical treatment is a real challenge because this area is occupied by several critical neurovascular elements. Currently, surgery is the first choice of treatment, however several factors may be present that necessitate choosing the alternative treatments such as Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with CPA meningioma who were treated by GKS for a period of 8 years, were retrospectively reviewed. Factors affecting clinical and radiological improvement were analyzed.RESULTS: The median tumor volume was 6cm<sup>3</sup>. The mean values for maximal and marginal dose were 20.2 and 13.6Gy, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 31.5 months. Tumor control (lack of progression) was achieved in 96.8% of the patients and 55.9% of the patients showed tumor regression on follow-up MRI. The actuarial 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 96%. Clinical improvement was seen in 49.5% of the patients while 11.8% experienced worsening or new-onset symptoms. Adverse radiation effects were seen in 4.3% of the patients. A worse symptomatic outcome, male sex, a lower tumor coverage, and marginal doses <13.5Gy were associated with worse radiologic outcomes. Worse radiologic outcomes and higher tumor volumes, especially tumor volumes >=8.5cc, were associated with worse symptomatic outcomes.

Anesthesia of mice with pentobarbitol delayed the increases in mRNA expression and the response was attenuated. Pre-treatment of mice with dexamethasone, in a schedule which suppressed acute-phase gene expression after brain irradiation, did not significantly change c-fos and junB induction.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter not always detectable with ordinary MRI. We evaluated relationships between DTI parameters and clinical profiles in INPH patients, along with differences in these DTI measures between CSF tap test (CSFTT) responders and non-responders. Method(s): Fifty-four INPH patients (26 CSFTT responders and 28 CSFTT non-responders) constituted the final group for analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were assessed using atlas-based tract mapping methods for 12 different fiber tracts. Result(s): CSFTT non-responders, when compared to responders, showed lower FA values in the left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and left cingulum-hippocampus (CgH). The associations between clinical symptoms of INPH and DTI measures were most commonly found in the CgH. Higher MD in the CgH correlated with poorer cognitive performance. Higher MD in the right CgH also correlated with gait or motor dysfunction. Lower FA in the right CgH was correlated with urinary disturbance and cognitive impairment. Lower FA values in the corticospinal tract (CST) and right ATR significantly correlated with poorer cognitive performance, and correlated with gait dysfunction. Higher MD in left CST correlated with cognitive impairment. Conclusion(s): Our findings may suggest a possibility for considering microstructural changes in white matter in ventriculomegaly patients as potential imaging markers for the prediction of CSFTT responders. We suppose that DTI parameters may help to assess cognitive dysfunction, gait, and motor deterioration in INPH, along with urinary disturbance.",Excluded
1820,"A prospective phase II trial of lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( LEN-DEX) in POEMS syndrome Background. POEMS syndrome is a rare form of B cell dyscrasia combining a proliferation usually of plasma cells, a polyneuropathy, osteocondensing bone lesions and multiple other clinical signs. The pathogenesis is not well understood but VEGF plays a major role. In patients with one or two sclerotic plasmacytoma and no bone marrow involvement, first line therapy should include radiation. For patients with diffuse sclerotic lesions, bone marrow involvement or absence of any bone lesion and for those who have not demonstrated stabilization of their disease 3 to 6 months after completing radiation systemic therapy is indicated, the most effective being high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Radiation of a single lesion is effective in about every other case and is accompanied by a fairly slow improvement of the neurological symptoms, often after initial worsening. ASCT seems to be accompanied by a number of important complications, in particular engraftment syndrome. Outside these 2 treatments there is no consensus therapy. Lenalidomide (LEN), a drug without serious neurological toxicity, has the advantage of being both anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic to malignant plasma cells (Richardson PG, Blood 2002;100(9):3063-7). We have recently reported a series of 20 French patients with POEMS syndrome treated by LEN with a good efficacy. We now report the first 27 patients of a prospective phase II trial using LEN + dexamethasone (LEN-DEX), 2 cycles preceding radiation or high dose treatment trying to obtain a rapid clinical response and to avoid engraftment syndrome or 9 cycles followed by 1 year LENalone in patients who cannot receive radiation or ASCT. Methods. Newly diagnosed or relapsing patients with POEMS syndrome who needed to be treated were eligible. Patients who can be treated by local radiation or intensive treatment with stem cell support receive two 28 day cycles of LEN 25 mg PO Days 1-21 and DEX 40 mg PO Days 1,8,15,22 before radiation or intensive treatment (Group 1), the other patients receive 9 cycles of the same LEN-DEX (Group 2) and then 12 cycles of continuous low dose LEN (10 mg). LEN dose was tapered to 10 mg for patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min and DEX to 20 mg for patients above 75 years of age and for those who were frail patients. Main eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome according to criteria by Dispenzieri et al (Am J Hematol 2012;87(8):804-14), an age of 18 or more, a creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min, no prior treatment with or contraindication to LEN and no uncontrolled thrombosis. Serum and plasma VEGF, serum electrophoresis, immunofixation and free light chain measurements were centrally monitored. Neurologic evaluations were performed using the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS), the Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) and the 10 meter walk test (10MWT). The primary endpoint was evaluation of the effectiveness of LEN-DEX combination using biological responses (decrease of monoclonal protein and serum VEGF level) and secondary endpoints were clinical and particularly neurological responses. Results. Twenty-seven patients have been included in 12 centres, median age was 61 (range 32-75), the median follow-up was 6.6 months (range 2-24). Eighteen patients were in group 1, with radiotherapy in 10 patients and ASCT in 8 patients; 9 patients were in group 2. Nineteen patients were in first line and 8 already treated. Only 2 patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events due to LEN (cytopenia) and 2 patients had allergic rashes, no thrombotic event occurred. No engraftment syndrome was noted in the 5 patients already treated with ASCT. To date, no patient have died. Evolution of VEGF median values in serum and plasma, M-spike and dFLC levels and evolution of neurological measurements are reported in table 1. Neurological improvement was very rapid in some patients, using ONLS and 10MWT 11/18 evaluable patients had a neurological improvement after 2 cycles with an improvement of 1 or more of the ONLS score an /or change of 0.1 m/s or more in the 10MWT. Only one patient who progressed after nine cycles received another therapy. Conclusion. This is the first prospective trial of LEN-DEX in POEMS syndrome. This combination seems well tolerated in this disease with a good efficacy on VEGF measurements and rapid neurological improvement in the majority of patients. Updated data will be presented at the meeting. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
2423,"S0713: A phase II study of cetuximab (CET) added to induction chemotherapy (ICT) of oxaliplatin (OX) and capecitabine (CAP), followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACR) for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) Background: NACR for LARC has been standard for 2 decades. Pathologic complete response (pCR) associates with improved survival and is an outcome surrogate in NACR clinical trials. In modern phase III trials of NACR in LARC, pCR ranges 1520%. CET improves response rates in KRAS wild-type (KRAS-WT) metastatic colorectal cancer. S0713 was designed to select patients (PTS) by KRAS-WT status to assess improvement in pCR with CET added to ICT and NACR for LARC. Method(s): Eligibility: Stage IIIII biopsy proven LARC, KRAS-WT, without bowel obstruction or prior therapy, adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function, and performance status of 0-2. Peripheral neuropathy > grade 2 was exclusionary. Enrollment target was 80 eligible PTS with planned interim analysis after 40 PTS received all therapy; if < 7 pCR were observed at interim, the study was to close. Treatment consisted of ICT then NACR and surgery. Treatment regimen: Cycle 1: OX 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day (d) 1,8,15,22,29, CET 400mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1 then 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d 8, 15, 22, 29 and CAP 825 mg/m<sup>2</sup> p.o.

Surgery occurred 3-8 weeks after NACR. 80 eligible PTS would give a power of 90% if true pCR > 35% at a significance of 0.04. The regimen would lack future interest if pCR < 20%. Result(s): From February 2009 to April 2013, 83 PTS registered; 5 were ineligible; 4 not treated. 74 were available for toxicity evaluation (TOX); 72 had available data; 62 PTS (86%) had surgery. 1 grade 5 TOX and 2 grade 4 TOX occurred. 7 PTS withdrew for TOX, 2 for other reasons. 18 of 62 PTS had pCR (25%, 95% CI 16-37%). 19 PTS (26%) had microscopic cancer; 35 PTS (49%) had minor/no response (10 no surgery). Conclusion(s): ICT and NACR with CET improved pCR over historical and recent rates of ~20%. Toxicity was generally acceptable. This approach can serve as a base for adding additional agents in KRAS-WT LARC.",Excluded
2285,"Combination of hypomorphic mutations of the Drosophila homologues of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and nucleosome assembly protein family genes disrupts morphogenesis, memory and detoxification Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is essential for biological responses to endogenous and exogenous toxins in mammals. Its Drosophila homolog spineless plays an important role in fly morphogenesis. We have previously shown that during morphogenesis spineless genetically interacts with CG5017 gene, which encodes a nucleosome assembly factor and may affect cognitive function of the fly. We now demonstrate synergistic interactions of spineless and CG5017 in pathways controlling oxidative stress response and long-term memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Oxidative stress was induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation of flies carrying hypomorphic mutation of spineless, mutation of CG5017, and their combination. To determine the sensitivity of these mutants to pharmacological modifiers of the irradiation effect, we irradiated flies growing on standard medium supplemented by radiosensitizer furazidin and radioprotector serotonin. The effects of irradiation were investigated by analyzing leg and antenna morphological structures and by using real-time PCR to measure mRNA expression levels for spineless, Cyp6g1 and Gst-theta genes. We also examined long-term memory in these mutants using conditioned courtship suppression paradigm. Our results show that the interaction of spineless and CG5017 is important for regulation of morphogenesis, long-term memory formation, and detoxification during oxidative stress. Since spineless and CG5017 are evolutionary conserved, these results must be considered when evaluating the risk of combining similar mutations in other organisms, including humans.",Excluded
2070,"Cost-Effectiveness of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus MRI Surveillance for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Purpose: Owing to conflicting prospective data, controversy exists regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for patients with ES-SCLC based on currently available evidence and in the context of the proposed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services alternative payment model. Methods and Materials: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing MRI surveillance alone with PCI for ES-SCLC. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data, and cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to consider model uncertainty. Result(s): In the base-case scenario, PCI was not cost-effective in this model, with an ICER of $168,456 per QALY gained compared with MRI surveillance alone, assuming that overall survival was 10 months for MRI surveillance alone and 12.5 months for PCI. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the variation of overall survival and cognitive decline rates between the 2 groups. In a scenario analysis in which all patients received hippocampal-avoidance PCI, the model results became nearly cost-effective with PCI. Conclusion(s): PCI was not found to be cost-effective within this model compared with MRI surveillance alone, owing to the neurocognition decline effect of PCI based on available evidence. Hippocampal-avoidance PCI may be a potential cost-effective strategy for ES-SCLC, with confirmation expected after an ongoing prospective clinical trial (The Southwest Oncolology Group MRI Brain Surveillance Alone Versus MRI Surveillance And Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation [MAVERICK]), which includes assessments of cognitive function.

1623,"The influence of mineralising radionecrosis on the dose distribution in interstitial radiation therapy of brain tumours The influences of radionecroses arising during interstitial radiation of brain tumours with 125I, 192Ir or 198Au on dose distribution was investigated using Monte Carlo methods. The necroses have a higher density than normal tissue due to radiation-induced changes in tissue composition as well as mineral deposits. They can have a diameter of up to 1 cm around the single seeds. The higher density and changed chemical composition compared to homogeneous normal tissue leads to increased absorption of radiation around the necroses which results in a lower dose rate in the surrounding tissue. It is shown that the formation of necroses during treatment with higher energy radiation such as 192Ir (340 keV) or 198Au (400 keV) may be neglected during therapy planning as the dose rate is affected by less than 2%. If low energy radiation, e.g. 125I (28 keV) is used, the dose rate can be reduced by more than 30%. In this case the influence of the necroses on dose distribution, at least for permanent 125I implantation, may not be negligible.",Excluded
2052,"Modulation of motor cortical excitability following rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of high frequency rTMS (25 Hz at 90-100% of resting motor threshold) on the excitability of the motor cortex of healthy human subjects.METHODS: Resting and active motor threshold, MEP recruitment curve (I/O curve), short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF), and the duration of the silent period (SP) were tested in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) before and twice after the end of 1500 pulses in 16 normal young adult male volunteers.RESULTS: Twenty-five Hertz rTMS decreased motor thresholds, reduced the duration of the silent period and had a tendency to increase the slope of the I/O curve. Most of these effects lasted for the duration of the two post-testing sessions (at least 30 min) and had returned to normal by 2h. There were no significant effects on SICI/ICF.CONCLUSION: Twenty-five Hertz rTMS can produce a long lasting increase in cortical excitability in healthy subjects.SIGNIFICANCE: This method may prove useful for the study of normal human physiology and for therapeutic manipulation of brain plasticity.",Excluded
2174,"Brachial plexus lesions in patients with cancer: 100 cases In patients with cancer, brachial plexus signs are usually caused by tumor infiltration or injury from radiation therapy (RT). We analyzed 100 cases of brachial plexopathy to determine which clinical criteria helped differentiate tumor from radiation injury. Seventy-eight patients had tumor (34 with previous RT), and 22 had radiation injury. Severe pain occurred in 80% of tumor patients but in only 19% of patients with radiation injury. The lower trunk (C7-8, T1) was involved in 72% of the tumors, and 32% also had epidural tumors. Seventy-eight percent of the radiation injuries affected the upper plexus (C5-6). Horner syndrome was more common in tumor, and lymphedema in radiation injury. The time from RT to onset of plexus symptoms, and the dose of RT, also differed. For symptoms within 1 year of RT, doses exceeding 6000 R were associated with radiation damage, whereas lower doses were associated with infiltration. Therefore, painless upper trunk lesions with lymphedema suggest radiation injury, and painful lower trunk lesions with Horner syndrome imply tumor infiltration.",Excluded
2044,"Ondansetron and azithromycin: A common combination that can cause QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias Case Reports: Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic medication which received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 19911. On September 9, 2011 the FDA announced an ongoing safety review of ondansetron due to suspicion of increasing the risk of abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart2. The FDA received numerous reports of patients taking ondansetron with abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) changes including the potentially fatal cardiac rhythm torsade de pointes2. Ondansetron labeling was updated to warn against prescribing in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. GlaxoSmith Kline, the manufacturer of Zofran, will publish results in the summer of 2012 of an ongoing study investigating the likelihood of ondansetron prolonging the QT interval2. The FDA and manufacturer recommend monitoring electrocardiograms on patients at high risk of arrhythmias1, 2. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has fewer case reports of QT interval prolongation after administration3, 4. Other macrolide antibiotics have been associated with QT interval prolongation but the manufacturer currently does not recommend monitoring electrocardiograms in patients receiving azithromycin1. However in April 2012, a recent study concluded azithromycin had a marginal increase in deaths secondary to cardiovascular causes compared to no antibiotics and treatment with amoxicillin5. In this case, a young female with no known history of structural cardiac disease has a cardiac arrest after receiving multiple doses of ondansetron and azithromycin.A 20 year old female presented to an outside hospital with a one week history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was transferred to our hospital on 9/11/2011 with persistent nausea and elevated liver function tests. She reported resolution of vomiting and diarrhea but felt weak and lethargic and complained of mild bilateral knee pain with no recent trauma. She also complained of sore throat and mild left ear discomfort. Upon presentation on 9/11/2011, she had significant transaminitis with ALT of 2644 U/L, AST of 1647 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 191 U/L. The patient had a total protein of 4.7 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, TSH of 20.797 uIU/mL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 5.8 mmol/L, chloride of 89 mmol/L, and bicarbonate of 19 mmol/L, creatinine of 17.1 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.3 mg/dL. Four milligrams of intravenous ondansetron was administered at an outside emergency room on 9/10/2011 at 22:50. Figure 1 shows rhythm strips prior to the patient experiencing cardiac arrest. She has an extensive past medical history which consists of metastatic thyroid cancer status post thyroidectomy and I-331 radiation, idiopathic end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, community acquired pneumonia, anemia, renal osteodystrophy, hypertension, parathyroidectomy and malnutrition. On 9/11/2011, the patient received four doses of intravenous ondansetron 4 mg at 01:37, 09:21, 15:06, and 23:16. On 9/12/2011, the transaminitis continued with ALT of 2587 U/L, AST of 2121 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 217 U/L, total protein of 4.2 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 6.3 mmol/L, chloride of 88 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, creatinine of 16.7 mg/dL, and calcium of 5.7 mg/dL. The first dose of intravenous azithromycin 500 milligrams was given at 13:28 for possible community acquired pneumonia. At 14:00, the patient had cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation after development of sudden-onset bradycardia and profound hypotension. Cardiac rhythms from this cardiac arrest are included in Figure 2. The patient received CPR, two doses of atropine, two doses of epinephrine, and one dose of calcium chloride with brief return of spontaneous pulses. Patient was intubated, dopamine infusion began, and ventricular fibrillation developed. She was shocked once and given sodium bicarbonate. The cardiac arrest lasted twenty-five minutes and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient did not receive any other oses of ondansetron. Antibiotics were broadened to include: azithromycin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. On 9/13/2011, transaminitis persisted with ALT of 1682 U/L, AST of 712 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 185 U/L, total protein of 3.5 g/dL, and total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL. Other abnormal labs included sodium of 131 mmol/L, potassium of 4.8 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 23 mmol/L, creatinine of 16 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.4 mg/dL (ionized calcium 0.79). Azithromycin 500 milligrams was administered intravenously at 12:09. Within the next hour, the nurse noted the patient to have large and dilated pupils and increased decerebrate posturing. Bradycardia with ventricular tachycardia resulting in pulseless electrical activity was recorded at 13:14. Figure 3 depicts rhythms from this timeframe. The code began at 13:15 with dopamine infusion and boluses of atropine, epinephrine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. She went into ventricular fibrillation and was shocked. The patient had return of spontaneous circulation with sustained ventricular tachycardia after several minutes. Azithromycin was discontinued and electrolytes were corrected. An EKG was taken on 9/13/2011 at 19:09 which showed a corrected QT interval of 499 milliseconds. She did not receive any more doses of ondansetron or azithromycin throughout the admission. CT scan of the head was negative for any acute findings.After the two codes, the patient recovered from anoxic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, and shock liver. Electrolytes were corrected daily if needed to avoid repeat cardiac arrests. After correction of electrolytes and discontinuation of azithromycin, the patient's QT interval remained prolonged. It is noted later that she had a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram from a previous admission (3/9/2011) which showed a corrected QT interval of 538 milliseconds. She received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator during this admission. DiscussionA normal QT interval depends on the balance of sodium and potassium in the heart6. QT prolongation results if cardiac potassium channels are blocked while QRS widening results when sodium channels in the heart are blocked7, 8. HERG is the cardiac potassium channel responsible for the rapid repolarizing current (IKr)7. The QT interval is influenced by the rapid repolarizing current produced by HERG as well as the slow repolarizing current produced by a different cardiac potassium channel KvLQT1 7. Blockage of sodium channels lengthens depolarization and repolarization of the action potential9 which leads to lengthening of the QRS. Patients with prolonged corrected QT intervals greater than 450 milliseconds in men and 460 milliseconds in women are at increased risk of developing arrhythmias6. As the lengthening occurs, the risk of torsade de pointes and ventricular arrythmias increases6.Known risk factors for the lengthening of the QT interval include patients with underlying heart conditions include: 9, 10, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia10,6, concomitant QT-prolonging medications10, 9, bradycardia9, 10, and female gender9. Medications that increase the QT interval include: macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin), droperidol, selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, 5-HT antagonists, antipsychotics, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, tacrolimus, voriconazole10, and now more recently brought to the attention by the FDA are 5-HT3 antagonists.This female patient had several comorbidities including: 6, 9 chronic renal failure11, 12,13, hypothyroidism14 and electrolyte abnormalities6, 10, 9 that can lead to prolonged QT interval and ventricular arrythmias. Because of her young age and lack of cardiac history, her previous prolonged QT interval may have been over looked. In addition to her comorbidities, concomitant medications such as ondansetron and azithromycin, which prolong the QT interval, could have resulted in her cardiac arrest. For years droperidol was commonly used for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) but was found to cause significant QT interval prolongation15. Droperidol is believed to cause QT interval prolongation by blocking the HERG potassium (IK) channel9. Droperidol received a black box warning in 2001 for the potential of QT prolongation and induction of arrhythmias9. In order to avoid this risk of QT interval prolongation and other side effects of droperidol, 5-HT3 antagonists became first-line agents for prevention and treatment of PONV15. After increased usage of ondansetron and other 5-HT3 antagonists, more reports of increased QT prolongation have emerged2. Ondansetron has been shown to block sodium channels which widens the QRS and the cardiac HERG potassium (IK) channel which prolongs the QT interval9. The impact of QT prolongation by droperidol and ondansetron has been compared in a nonrandomized fashion. A study of 16 patients determined that both droperidol and ondansetron increase the QT interval alone and in combination with each other16. In a study of 85 patients with PONV, droperidol 0.75 mg intravenously and ondansetron 4 mg intravenously produced similar QT interval prolongation15. No patients received any other QT interval-prolonging medications. Forty-three patients received 0.75 milligrams of droperidol intravenously while forty-two patients received 4 milligrams of ondansetron intravenously when PONV was experienced. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at baseline and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after medication administration. Although the study was nonrandomized, the electrocardiograms were analyzed after completion of the study by one blinded investigator.",Excluded
2400,"Casticin inhibits growth and enhances ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis through the suppression of STAT3 signaling cascade Casticin (CTC), one of the major components of Vitex rotundifolia L., has been reported to exert significant beneficial pharmacological activities and can function as an antiprolactin, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, analgesic, and immunomodulatory agent. This study aimed at investigating whether the proapoptotic effects of CTC may be mediated through the abrogation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in a variety of human tumor cells. We found that CTC significantly decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and suppressed cell proliferation in 786-O, YD-8, and HN-9 cells. CTC also induced programmed cell death that was found to be mediated via caspase-3 activation and induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Interestingly, CTC repressed both constitutive and interleukin-6-induced STAT3 activation in 786-O and YD-8 cells but only affected constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in HN-9 cells. Moreover, CTC could potentiate ionizing radiation-induced apoptotic effects leading to the downregulation of STAT3 activation and thus may be used in combination with radiation against diverse malignancies.",Excluded

Tractography providesan importantanatomic guidance in the preoperative planning process, which aims at maximizing resection whilst minimising morbidity. This study aimed atdetermining the agreement between two different software packages for delineating corticospinal tract (CST), arcuate fasciculus (AF) and optic radiation (OR). METHOD(S): Forty-six histopathologically proven gliomapatients subdivided into:groupA with tracts passing at the tumour margin; and groupB with tracts passing through tumour and/ or in the peritumoural oedema. FSL and MRTrix software were used for tracking, in each patient,CST (hand, foot and lips component), AF and OR using the same regions of interest. Qualitative evaluation of the agreement between the two methods was performed by two experienced observers in consensus. RESULT(S): The tracts identified: Were comparable for: CST-foot in 8(5) out of 11(8) cases in groupA (B); CST-hand in 6 out of 8 cases in groupB; Had less false positives in MRTrix for: CST-hand in 7 out of 11 cases in groupA; CST-lips in 5(6) out of 8(8) cases in groupA (B); AF in 4(8) out of 7(9) cases in groupA (B); Were more accurate in FSL for: OR in 6(6) out of 6(7) cases in groupA (B).

Fifteen-day-old cultures were exposed to blue actinic light or to white fluorescent light for 24 hours. Cultures were treated by the addition of different concentrations of crocin for 24 hours before light exposure or for 8 hours after light exposure. Cultures kept in the dark were used as controls. Green nucleic acid stain assay was used to evaluate cell death. Rods and cones were immunolabeled with specific antibodies and counted. TUNEL labeling was used to detect fragmented DNA in fixed cells after light exposure.RESULTS: Primary retinal cell cultures contained a mixture of retinal cells enriched in photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Muller cells. Twenty-four-hour exposure to blue and white light induced death in 70% to 80% of the photoreceptors in bovine and primate retinal cell cultures. Crocin protected the photoreceptors against blue light- or white light-mediated damage in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of approximately 30 microM. TUNEL assays confirmed that crocin protected photoreceptors from light damage.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that blue and white light selectively induce rod and cone cell death in an in vitro model.

1744,"Multisensory plasticity in congenitally deaf mice: how are cortical areas functionally specified? The neocortex of congenitally deaf mice was examined using electrophysiological recording techniques combined with cortical myeloarchitecture. Our results indicate that relative activity patterns across sensory systems during development contribute to modality assignment of cortical fields as well as the size of cortical fields. In congenitally deaf mice, ""auditory cortex"" contained neurons that responded to somatosensory, visual, or both somatosensory and visual stimulation; the primary visual area contained a larger proportion of neurons that responded to somatosensory stimulation than in normal animals, and the primary visual area had significantly increased in size. Thus, cortical architecture and functional specification were de-correlated.

1561,"Diurnal changes in retinula cell sensitivities and receptive fields (two-dimensional angular sensitivity functions) in the apposition eyes of Ligia exotica (Crustacea, Isopoda) The structural organization of the retinula cells in the eye of Ligia exotica changes diurnally. At night, the microvilli elongate, losing the regular and parallel alignment characteristic of the day condition. Crystalline cones and distal rhabdom tips are not pushed into each other during the day, but at night the rhabdoms protrude into the crystalline cones by up to 5 microm. Screening pigment granules in the retinula cells disperse during the night, but migrate radially towards the vicinity of the rhabdom during the day. No such displacements of the pigment granules of either distal or proximal screening pigment cells were observed. The sensitivity of the eye, monitored by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, changes diurnally: values at midnight are, on average, 10 times those occurring during the day. However, intracellular recordings from single retinula cells (50 during the day and 50 at night) indicate that the difference between night and day sensitivities is only 2.5-fold. Two-dimensional angular sensitivity curves, indicative of a single unit's spatial sensitivity, had considerably less regular outlines at night than during the day. If based on the 50 % sensitivity level, day and night eyes possessed receptive fields of almost identical width (approximately 2 degrees), but if sensitivities below the 50 % limit were included, then receptive fields at night were significantly more extensive. We suggest that the morphological adaptations and diurnal changes in chromophore content seen in the apposition eye of L. exotica allow this animal to improve its photon capture at night while preserving at least some of the spatial resolving power characteristic of the light-adapted state. This would explain why this animal is capable of performing complex escape behaviours in the presence of predators both in bright and in very dim light.",Excluded
1922,"Acute abdominal pain: is there a potential role for MRI in the setting of the emergency department in a patient with renal calculi? Acute flank pain is a frequent clinical presentation encountered in emergency departments, and a work-up for obstructive urolithiasis in this setting is a common indication for computed tomography (CT). However, imaging alternatives to CT for the evaluation of renal colic are warranted in some clinical situations, such as younger patients, pregnancy, patients that have undergone multiple prior CT exams and also patients with vague clinical presentations. MRI, although relatively insensitive for the direct detection of urinary calculi, has the ability to detect the secondary effects of obstructive urolithiasis. Using rapid, single shot T2-weighted sequences without and with fat saturation provides an abdominopelvic MR examination that can detect the sequelae of clinically active stone disease, in addition to alternate inflammatory processes that may mimic the symptoms of renal colic. In addition, MR nephro-urography (MRNU) has the ability to provide quantitative analysis of renal function that has the potential to direct clinical management in the setting of obstructing calculi. This review describes the potential utility and limitations of MRI in the emergency setting for diagnosing causes of flank pain and renal colic, particularly in patients with unusual presentations or when an alternative to CT may be warranted.",Excluded
1756,"Direct correlation between cardiac and striatal <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in de novo Parkinson's disease Background Even at the early stage of Parkinson's Disease (PD) nuclear medicinetechniques, such as <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT SPECT and <sup>123</sup>I -MIBG scintigraphy, may reveal pathological findings, showing striatum and cardiac reduced uptake, respectively. This information about nigro-striatal and sympathetic cardiac neuronal loss may contribute to the early diagnosis of PD and provide relevant elements for differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndrome. The main limitation to investigate these different neuronal systems, is related to the need of two scans, with two tracers and double radiation exposure for patients. <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA is a dopamine precursor able to evaluate synthetic and storage capacity of dopamine in pre-synaptic terminals. This PET radiopharmaceutical is a sensitive bio-marker to assess nigro-striatal dysfunction and its diagnostic accuracy is comparable to those of <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT. However, <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA has never been validate so far as a biomarker of cardiac sympathetic denervation, despite its cardiac uptake. Our aim is evaluating the association between cardiac and striatal <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in de novo PD, in order to test whether it may be further evaluated as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. Methods Sixteen patients with de novo PD were included in this study. Patients with history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. The patients were given carbidopa (2,5 mg/Kg) orally, and after 60 min, received 185 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA. PET/CT was acquired 90 min after the injection. Cardiac <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA-PET/CT was acquired at the end of brain scan. Automatic segmentation and semiquantification of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA striatal uptake was asses using basal ganglia matching tools package. Regions of interest were drawn over the heart and mediastinum. The ratio between the uptake in the left ventricle and mediastinum (H/M ratio) was recorded for each scan. Results Both in case of putamen (r=0.75, p=0.0009) and caudate (r=0.57, p=0.02) , a significant correlation between the more affected site of striatal uptake and H/M ratio was found. Direct correlation between striatal uptake and H/M ratio was confirmed also in the controlateral site (putamen: r=0.63, p= 0.0096; caudate: r=0.54, p=0.03). No significant inverse correlation was found between UPDRS III and H/M ratio (r=- 0.3630, p= 0.16). Conclusion These findings support the hypothesis that cardiac 18FDOPA uptake may be used as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. If they were confirmed, it will be feasible to image striatal and cardiac pre-synaptic monoaminergic function with a single radiopharmaceutical, dual acquisition, and PET/CT resolution, thus sparing radiation exposure and costs.",Excluded
1296,"Survival of melanoma patients treated with targeted therapy and immunotherapy after systematic upfront control of brain metastases by radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy (TT) and immunotherapies (ITs) have dramatically improved survival in metastatic melanoma (MM). However, their efficacy on brain metastasis (BM) remains limited and poorly documented.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive MM patients (pts) with BMs, all systematically upfront treated by Gamma-Knife (GK) at first BM and retreated in case of new BMs, from 2010 to 2015 at the time when ipilimumab BRAF +/- MEK inhibitors and anti-PD1 were introduced in practice. Survival after 1st GK (OS<sub>GK1</sub>) according to prognostic factors and treatment.RESULTS: Among 179 consecutive pts treated by GK, 109 received IT and/or TT after the 1st GK. Median OS<sub>GK1</sub> was 10.95 months and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 49.5% and 27.4%, respectively, versus a median overall survival (OS) of 2.29 months (p < .001) in those who did not receive IT or TT. In pts who initially had a single BM, median OS and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 14.46 months, 66.7% and 43.4%, respectively; in pts with 2-3 BMs: 8.85 months, 46.4% and 31%, respectively; in pts with >3 BMs: 7.25 months, 37.2% and 11.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis for OS<sub>GK1</sub> confirmed that IT and TT were significantly and highly protective. Best OS<sub>GK1</sub> was observed in BRAF-wild-type pts receiving anti-PD1 or in BRAF-mutated pts receiving BRAF-inhibitors and anti-PD1 (12.26 and 14.82 months, respectively).CONCLUSION: In real-life MM pts with BMs, a strategy aiming at controlling BM with GK together with TT and/or TT seems to achieve unprecedented survival rates.",Excluded
2130,"2MO Radiotherapy in cancer is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor patient outcomes Background: Diffuse gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors that invariably relapse despite treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy. Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy can drive tumors to develop a hypermutator phenotype. In contrast, the genomic effects of radiation therapy (RT) remain unknown. Method(s): We analyzed the mutational spectra following treatment with ionizing radiation in sequencing data from 190 paired primary-recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset and 2249 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Result(s): We identified a significant increase in the burden of small deletions following radiation therapy that was independent of other factors. These novel deletions demonstrated distinct characteristics when compared to pre-existing deletions present prior to RT-treatment and deletions in RT-untreated tumors. Radiation therapy-acquired deletions were characterized by a larger deletion size (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=1.2e-02 and P=8e-11, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test), an increased distance to repetitive DNA elements (P<2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and a reduction in microhomology at breakpoints (P=3.2e-02, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These observations suggested that canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) was the preferred pathway for DNA double strand break repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, radiotherapy resulted in frequent chromosomal deletions and significantly increased frequencies of CDKN2A homozygous deletions. Finally, a high burden of RT-associated deletions was associated with worse clinical outcomes (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=4.7e-02, HR=2.59 [95% CI: 1.01, 6.60] and P=2.5e-02, HR=1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.94], respectively; multivariable Cox regression). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that effective repair of RT-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival and that inhibiting c-NHEJ may be a viable strategy for improving the cancer-killing effect of radiotherapy. Taken together, the identified genomic scars as a result of radiation therapy reflect a more aggressive tumor with increased levels of resistance to follow up treatments.

2263,"Carotid blowout and cerebral gas embolism related to bidirectional carotid-esophageal fistula: A serious complication of esophageal cancer under radiotherapy Carotid-esophageal fistula (CEF) could be a serious complication of esophageal cancer in a patient receiving radiotherapy. We reported a 47-year-old male patient with advanced cervical esophageal cancer under radiotherapy who developed CEF with the presentations of unstable vital signs and disturbances of consciousness. Carotidesophageal fistula-associated life-threatening conditions of carotid blowout syndrome and cerebral gas embolism were diagnosed after presentation. Subsequently, intramural dissection of esophageal and gastric walls, profound hemoperitoneum, and hypovolemic shock occurred. When a patientwho had an underlying cervical esophageal cancer treated by radiotherapy develops unstable vital signs and neurological symptoms, CEF should be kept in mind in the differential diagnoses. Physicians must be alert of the associated complications of carotid blowout syndrome and cerebral gas embolism and perform timely management including decompression, fluid resuscitation, and aggressive endovascular procedure when indicated.

1435,"Ultrastructural morphometry of parotid acinar cells following fractionated irradiation The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effects on the ultrastructure of parotid glands after fractionated irradiation. The method implemented involved 5 x 6 Gy and 5 x 8 Gy, Monday to Friday 6 MV photons. By unilateral irradiation, the contralateral parotid gland served as a control. Although irradiation diminished the acinar cell density in light microscopic sections from 75 to 32% after 5 x 8 Gy of irradiation, ultrastructural morphometry could not detect any statistically significant differences in acinar cell size, nuclear size, nuclear density, granule area, mean granule size, or granule density. In general, greater differences were seen between rats receiving 30 or 40 Gy, on both the irradiated and the control size, than between the irradiated side and the control side. This was interpreted as due to differences in the nutritional state of the animals. This analysis concluded that individual acinar cells that survive irradiation seem not to be damaged in the long term when evaluated at the ultrastructural level. The study further stresses the importance of adequate sampling sizes and the use of adequate controls.",Excluded
1350,"Reproducibility of patient positioning during routine radiotherapy, as assessed by an integrated megavoltage imaging system A portal imaging system has been used, in conjunction with a movie measurement technique to measure set-up errors for 15 patients treated with radiotherapy of the pelvis and for 12 patients treated with radiotherapy of the brain. The pelvic patients were treated without fixation devices and the brain patients were treated with individually-moulded plastic shells. As would be expected the brain treatments were found to be more accurate than the pelvic treatments. Results are presented in terms of five error types: random error from treatment to treatment, error between mean treatment position and simulation position, random simulation error, systematic simulator-to-treatment errors and total treatment error. For the brain patients the simulation-to-treatment error predominates and random treatment errors were small (95% < or = 3 mm, 77% < or = 1.5 mm). Vector components of the systematic simulation-to-treatment errors were 1-2 mm with maximal random simulation error of +/- 5 mm (2 S.D.). There is much interest in the number of verification films necessary to evaluate treatment accuracy. These results indicate that one check film performed at the first treatment is likely to be sufficient for set-up evaluation. For the pelvis the random treatment error is larger (95% < or = 4.5 mm, 87% < or = 3 mm). The systematic simulation-to-treatment error is up to 3 mm and the maximal random simulation error is +/- 6 mm (2 S.D.). Thus corrections made solely on the basis of a first day check film may not be sufficient for adequate set-up evaluation.",Excluded
1429,"Sensori-neural hearing loss in patients treated with irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma The present investigation has been carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the inner ear to irradiation. Cochlear function was tested in a cohort of 22 patients before and 7-84 months after receiving external irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The pre-irradiation sensori-neural hearing threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was used as a baseline for the individual patient, and the observed sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-irradiation values. The pre-irradiation hearing level or patient age was not correlated with the actual SNHL. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between the total radiation dose to the inner ear and the observed hearing impairment. SNHL was most pronounced in the high frequencies, with values up to 35 dB (4000 Hz) and 25 dB (2000 Hz) in some patients. The latent period for the complication appeared to be 12 months or more. The deleterious effect of irradiation on the hearing should be kept in mind both in treatment planning and in the follow-up after radiotherapy.",Excluded
1868,"Effect of Pregabalin on Radiotherapy-Related Neuropathic Pain in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial PURPOSE: Neuropathic pain is an unavoidable treatment-related adverse event among patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of pregabalin versus placebo in the treatment of radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in four centers in China. Eligible patients with a mean pain intensity score of 4 or more on an 11-point numeric rating scale were randomly assigned to receive either active treatment with a flexible dose of pregabalin or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was pain reduction measured on the numeric rating scale.RESULT: There were 128 patients who received treatment as randomly assigned. Pain intensity reduction was 2.44 in the pregabalin arm and 1.58 in the placebo arm at week 16, yielding an adjusted mean difference of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.44; P = .003). In the pregabalin arm, 38 patients (59.4%) achieved at least 30% pain relief versus 21 (32.8%) in the placebo arm ( P = .006). Nineteen patients (29.7%) in the pregabalin group and five (7.8%) in the placebo group achieved 50% or greater pain relief ( P = .003). Total scores on the Profile of Mood States-Short Form, pain severity and functional interference of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, as well as the physiology and psychology domain of the WHO Quality of Life-BREF all were reduced significantly at week 16 in patients who received pregabalin compared with those who received placebo. There was no significant difference ( P = .29) in the incidence of experiencing at least one adverse event in the pregabalin arm (n = 35; 54.7%) versus the placebo arm (n = 29; 45.3%).CONCLUSION: Patients treated with pregabalin with radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain had greater pain alleviation, better mood states, and higher quality of life compared with patients in the placebo group, with a good tolerability.",Excluded

Cox proportional hazard models were used to perform univariate (UVA) and multivariate analyses (MVA). Cause specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were plotted using cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meir curves, respectively.RESULTS: Of the 91% patients that presented with impaired voice, 73% noted significant improvement. Chronic laryngeal edema and dysphagia were noted in 18% and 7%, respectively. The five year LC was 94% (T1a), 83% (T1b), 87% (T2a), 65% (T2b); the ten year LC was 89% (T1a), 83% (T1b), 87% (T2a), and 53% (T2b). The cumulative incidence of death due to larynx cancer at 10 yrs was 5.5%, respectively. On MVA, T-stage, heavy alcohol consumption during treatment, and used of weighted fields were predictive for poor outcome (p < 0.05). The five year CSS and OS was 95.9% and 76.8%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Definitive radiotherapy provides excellent LC and CSS for early glottis carcinoma, with excellent voice preservation and minimal long term toxicity. Alternative management strategies should be pursued for T2b glottis carcinomas.",Excluded
2345,"Repair and mutagenesis at oxidized DNA lesions in the developing brain of wild-type and Ogg1-/- mice OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells. The enzyme removes 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, believed to be the most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5-10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1(-/-) mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1(-/-) mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1(-/-) mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain.",Excluded
1661,"Peritumoral brain edema after stereotactic radiosurgery for asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas : Risks and pattern of evolution Objective : To investigate the risks and pattern of evolution of peritumoral brain edema (PTE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas. Methods : A retrospective study was conducted on 320 patients (median age 56 years, range 24-87 years) who underwent primary Gamma Knife radiosurgery for asymptomatic meningiomas between 1998 and 2012. The median tumor volume was 2.7 cc (range 0.2-10.5 cc) and the median follow-up was 48 months (range 24-168 months). Volumetric data sets for tumors and PTE on serial MRIs were analyzed. The edema index (EI) was defined as the ratio of the volume of PTE including tumor to the tumor volume, and the relative edema indices (rEIs) were calculated from serial EIs normalized against the baseline EI. Risk factors for PTE were analyzed using logistic regression. Results : Newly developed or increased PTE was noted in 49 patients (15.3%), among whom it was symptomatic in 28 patients (8.8%). Tumor volume larger than 4.2 cc (p<0.001), hemispheric tumor location (p=0.005), and pre-treatment PTE (p<0.001) were associated with an increased risk of PTE. rEI reached its maximum value at 11 months after SRS and decreased thereafter, and symptoms resolved within 24 months in most patients (85.7%). Conclusion : Caution should be exercised in decision-making on SRS for asymptomatic meningiomas of large volume (>4.2 cc), of hemispheric location, or with pre-treatment PTE. PTE usually develops within months, reaches its maximum degree until a year, and resolves within 2 years after SRS. Copyright © 2015 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded

She had previously been evaluated at an urgent care facility where she was given a course of steroids for her symptoms. Although she had brief improvement with prednisone, her symptoms returned after the course ended. She denied any other systemic symptoms specifically weight loss, fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She had recently noticed darkening of her urine and possible jaundice, but stated this seemed to be improving. Her physical exam was notable for jaundice without evidence of chronic liver disease. Her abdomen was soft , non-tender, and she had no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation showed AST 166 IU/L, ALT 90 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.4 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase of 401 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse dilation of intrahepatic ducts and a 1.5-cm common bile duct (CBD), as well as 4.8 x 6.7 cm heterogeneous mass in the gallbladder with a second similarly enhancing lesion seen at the distal CBD. The pancreas appeared normal. An ERCP was performed which revealed a polypoid appearing mass within the distal bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and this was biopsied after eversion into the duodenal lumen. Initial differential included biliary cystadenoma/ adenocarcinoma versus atypical cholangiocarcinoma versus lymphoma or IPMN of the bile ducts. However, biopsy specimen showed pigmented deposition on H&E stain with subsequent positive staining for S-100 and HMB proteins consistent with melanoma. Unfortunately, a staging MRI of the brain showed evidence of metastatic lesions. Thorough skin, eye, and mucosal examination did not reveal evidence of a primary lesion, and a CT-PET scan showed large, hypermetabolic lesions in the gallbladder and distal bile duct without evidence of other primary source. Therefore, our final diagnosis is primary biliary melanoma with metastatic disease to the brain. Only 10 other cases of primary biliary melanoma have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is based on stage of disease at presentation with surgical resection providing the best chance for survival. Unfortunately, our patient had metastases present at diagnosis and was not a candidate for surgery.

1834,"Analysis of occupational radiation exposure during cerebral angiography utilizing a new real time radiation dose monitoring system BACKGROUND: Thermoluminescent dosimeter badges currently utilized to monitor occupational radiation exposures are limited in their ability to provide timely feedback, restricting workers' ability to identify unnecessary exposure. New real time radiation monitoring systems provide an opportunity for workers to immediately identify and alter problematic behaviors in the neuroangiography suite, decreasing unnecessary exposures, lowering risk, and maximizing safety efforts.METHODS: Real time radiation monitoring was performed for 120 diagnostic cerebral angiography procedures. Data were collected in two phases, for procedures performed by two physician participants (30 procedures per physician per phase). Workers were blinded to their real time dose in phase I, and unblinded in phase II. Individual exposures (Sv) and the incidence of red events (exposure rates >=2.0 mSv/h) were collected for each assigned participating role (physician A, physician B, nurse, scrubbed technologist, and circulating technologist). The dose area product was collected for each procedure to standardize against variations in procedure duration or intensity.RESULTS: In phase II, significant decreased radiation exposure was observed for all roles except physician A. Physician B decreased most from 24.3x10(-8) to 6.9x10(-8) Sv/Gy-cm(2) (p<0.0001). Rates of red events decreased similarly for all roles except physician A, and were significant for all roles except the nurse role.CONCLUSIONS: Real time radiation dose monitoring during diagnostic cerebral angiography may help to reduce occupational radiation exposures for healthcare workers.",Excluded

Sleep problems were reported by nearly half of the subjects during and after treatment. Severity ratings of symptoms were mild to moderate but significantly higher by the end of therapy (P </= .01). There were no significant differences in psychological mood states during or after treatment except for the fatigue subscale (P </= .05).

2365,"Diabetic levels of glucose increase cellular reducing equivalents but reduce survival in three models of 661W photoreceptor-like cell injury BACKGROUND: The effect of excess glucose on retinal cellular health remains controversial, and cellular reducing equivalents, as indicators of cellular energy production, are widely used as substitute indicators of retinal cellular health. These investigations hypothesised that excess energy substrate availability, as occurs in the diabetic retina, increases the susceptibility of retinal neurons to injury in the presence of increased cellular reducing equivalents.METHODS: The response of 661W cells to phototoxicity, oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and apoptosis induction by staurosporine was characterised in the presence of 5mM glucose and B27 defined media without insulin. Cellular insult was produced by phototoxicity, H2O2 and the apoptosis induction agent staurosporine. The effect of physiologically relevant alterations in environmental glucose on cellular reducing equivalents was assessed by MTT dye reduction and NAD(P)H assays, and cell survival was assessed via caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry.RESULTS: 661W photoreceptor-like cells underwent dose dependent cell death primarily by apoptosis in response to phototoxic insult, H2O2, and staurosporine by all measures of cellular viability. Exposure of cells to 25mM glucose (diabetic-type conditions) increased cell death in response to all insults as measured by caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Cellular reducing equivalents were nonetheless increased in all models of injury in the presence of excess glucose. The mechanism of this increase was partly due to increased NADPH but not NADH levels in the presence of 25mM glucose.CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to 25mM glucose decreased the resilience of 661W photoreceptor-like cells to a range of cellular stressors whilst maintaining or increasing cellular reducing equivalents, partly be increasing NADPH levels. This shows that in 661W cells, diabetic levels of glucose decrease cellular resilience to injury. The decoupling of cellular reducing equivalents levels from cell survival has important implications when investigating the mechanisms of neuronal damage in diabetic retinal neuropathy.",Excluded

1832,"Control of rat hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons by a circadian clock that is entrained by the daily light-off signal Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the immediate-early gene, c-fos can regulate, through its protein product Fos, the expression of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene. In the present study, immunohistochemistry for Fos and beta-endorphin was used to assess the basal activity of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin-producing neurons throughout a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Here, we showed that Fos is undetectable in most beta-endorphin neurons from late morning until 30 min after light offset in the evening, whereas Fos is spontaneously expressed in these neurons after 1 h following dark onset. The number of beta-endorphin neurons expressing Fos increases continuously during the first half of the dark phase, is maximal at the middle of this phase and decreases through late night and early morning, reaching a nadir 2-3 h after light onset. Acute shifts of lighting parameters allowed us to demonstrate that the light-off signal per se is neither sufficient nor necessary for Fos expression in beta-endorphin neurons. However, when recurrent, this signal is able to entrain Fos expression after a period of adaptation to the new light/dark schedule. Moreover, an expression of Fos in beta-endorphin neurons persists during subjective night in rat exposed to constant light or constant dark for two to three days. Thus, the occurrence of the daily rhythmic increase in the expression of Fos protein in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons exclusively at (subjective) night suggests that these neurons are, most likely, controlled by a (circadian) nocturnal oscillator. Our data also reveal an interesting property of this oscillator: its entrainment by the daily light-to-dark transition signal.",Excluded

1959,"Effectiveness of lead cap in radiation protection of head in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory Aims: Occupational head exposure of radiation was suggested to be associated with brain tumors in interventional cardiologists. The brain is of particular interest, because it is one of the least protected organs during interventional procedures. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the lead cap in radiation protection of the head and compare it with that of a ceiling mounted lead glass screen in a real life setting. Our secondary goal was to test the comfort and convenience of the lead cap when worn on a regular daily basis. Methods and Results: Radiation dose to the operator was recorded by the three dosimeters placed outside the lead cap, inside the cap and outside the apron at the level of trunk for a total of 18 months. Only the lead cap (Burkhart Roentgen International, St Petersburg, Florida, USA) but not the ceiling suspended protective glass screen was used during the first three months of measurement of radiation dose to the head. Later concomitant use of both protection devices was analysed. The dosimeter outside the cap recorded a dose of 2.77 mSv radiation when the ceiling mounted screen was not used during the first 3 months. The doses were 2.4 to 12.5 times higher in comparison to the measurements that were recorded when the ceiling suspended screen was used. However, a remarkable dose of radiation (ranged between 1.16-0.22 mSv) was received by the operators head despite the use of ceiling mounted screen. Yet, even without the protection of the ceiling mounted screen, the dose recorded by the dosimeter inside the lead cap during the first period was <0.1 mSv. As expected, the doses to the head recorded by the dosimeter inside the cap during the next 15 months period were also less than 0.1 mSv with the use of the ceiling mounted screen. Therefore, a cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless of the use of the screen. Conclusion(s): A cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence was much more protective than the mounted screen and reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless the use of the mounted screen. Although being a subjective conclusion, the operator regularly wearing the lead cap reported that the lead cap is reasonably comfortable and offers an acceptable wearing comfort when used on daily practice.",Excluded
2368,"Daytime colour preference in Drosophila depends on the circadian clock and TRP channels Light discrimination according to colour can confer survival advantages by guiding animals towards food and shelter and away from potentially harmful situations<sup>1,2</sup>. Such colour-dependent behaviour can be learned or innate. Data on innate colour preference in mammals remain controversial<sup>3</sup> and there are limited data for simpler organisms<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we show that, when given a choice among blue, green and dim light, fruit flies exhibit an unexpectedly complex pattern of colour preference that changes according to the time of day. Flies show a strong preference for green in the early morning and late afternoon, a reduced green preference at midday and a robust avoidance of blue throughout the day. Genetic manipulations reveal that the peaks in green preference require rhodopsin-based visual photoreceptors and are controlled by the circadian clock. The midday reduction in green preference in favour of dim light depends on the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels dTRPA1 and Pyrexia, and is also timed by the clock. By contrast, avoidance of blue light is primarily mediated by multidendritic neurons, requires rhodopsin 7 and the TRP channel Painless, and is independent of the clock. Our findings show that several TRP channels are involved in colour-driven behaviour in Drosophila, and reveal distinct pathways of innate colour preference that coordinate the behavioural dynamics of flies in ambient light.",Excluded
1427,"Protection against focal cerebral ischemia following exposure to a pulsed electromagnetic field There is evidence that electromagnetic stimulation may accelerate the healing of tissue damage following ischemia. We undertook this study to investigate the effects of low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) exposure on cerebral injury in a rabbit model of transient focal ischemia (2 h occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion). PEMF exposure (280 V, 75 Hz, IGEA Stimulator) was initiated 10 min after the onset of ischemia and continued throughout reperfusion (six exposed, six controls). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology were used to measure the degree of ischemic injury. Exposure to pulsed electromagnetic field attenuated cortical ischemia edema on MRI at the most anterior coronal level by 65% (P < 0.001). On histologic examination, PEMF exposure reduced ischemic neuronal damage in this same cortical area by 69% (P < 0.01) and by 43% (P < 0.05) in the striatum. Preliminary data suggest that exposure to a PEMF of short duration may have implications for the treatment of acute stroke.",Excluded
1719,"Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Case for Caution Purpose: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has a well-recognized role in the treatment of leukemia and small-cell lung cancer. Clinical utility has yet to be determined for breast cancer, where an emerging group at high risk of brain metastasis has fuelled consideration of PCI. Methods and Materials: In reviewing our experience with PCI as part of a complex protocol for advanced breast cancer, we present descriptive data on late central nervous system outcomes in those receiving PCI. After high-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, Stage IIIB/IV breast cancer responders underwent tandem autologous marrow transplantation. Those in continued remission were referred for PCI. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered by usual means, at 36 Gy in 20 fractions. Result(s): Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia. Conclusion(s): We present a series of advanced breast cancer patients treated prophylactically with whole-brain radiotherapy following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. Although the therapeutic benefit of PCI is not ascertainable here, we describe brain metastases occurring despite PCI and serious long-term neurobehavioral sequelae in PCI-treated patients. Any further investigation of PCI in high-risk breast cancer will need to be approached with caution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1325,"Targeting glioma stem cells with Car-T immunotherapy in xenograft animal models Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors often arise from glioma-initiating cells or glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are usually resistant to the standard therapeutic regiment of radiation and chemotherapy and hence have been an attractive target for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies to treating recurrent GBMs. Chimeric antigen receptor expressing engineered T (CAR-T) cells are redirected to detect and destroy rare tumor cells that express specific tumor antigens. CAR-T cells have been successful in treating hematological cancers, and moderately effective in remission of primary GBM tumors, but not yet been successful in the immunotherapeutic targeting of GSCs or recurrent GBMs. In this study, we have treated two patient-derived GSCs and tumor cell line derived neurospheres, as well as GSC/neurosphere-derived secondary tumor cells with CAR-T cells that specifically target IL13Ralpha2 tumor antigens on GBMs. These GSCs and neurospheres were resistant to radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy but were successful in activating antigen-specific CAR-T cells- as observed by increased proliferation as well as secretion of cytokines. In vitro co-culture of CAR-T cells with GSCs, neurospheres, and secondary tumors resulted in the effective cytotoxic killing of tumor cells. In experimental animals bearing xenograft implantation of GSCs or redefined secondary tumor cells, tumors went into remission when treated with CAR-T cells, in comparison to treatment with T cells that did not express specific CAR molecule. Together, we conclude that CAR-T cell immunotherapy can be an effective approach to targeting GSCs and treating secondary or recurrent GBM tumors.",Excluded

The chemical as well as laser light stimulations were limited to the processes of the neuron isolated from the cell body with a separator. The action potentials elicited by bradykinin (BK) in the cell body were reversibly suppressed by the irradiation of laser light. The laser irradiation may block the conduction of nociceptive signals in primary afferent neurons. The present experimental method offers a simple and easy to use procedure for studying the pain relief effects by laser irradiation.",Excluded

Dose to the surrounding normal brain from an <sup>125</sup>I implant has been compared with the dose from an external irradiation technique. Results show that an implant offers a higher dose gradient around the tumor and hence a lower dose to the normal brain. Moreover, some irregular-shaped tumors, while ideal for a stereotactic implant, may be very difficult to treat with external beams without delivering a significant radiation dose to the normal brain. An implant seems to be dosimetrically superior to external irradiation for delivering large tumor doses.",Excluded
2202,"Invasive tracheal metastasis: Fatal complication of stereotactic body radiation therapy Introduction: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important and increasing public health threat in the developed world. In the US 17 % of patients diagnosed with de novo RCC present with metastatic disease most often to lung (50-60%), bone (30-40%), liver (20%) and brain (5-11%). No treatment is effective for majority of patients with systemic disease; median survival time of those with metastatic disease is 6-12 months with a 2-year survival rate of 10-20%<sup>1</sup>. Stereotactic body high-dose fraction radiation therapy (SBRT) has shown a high local control rate however it is not without complications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66 year old male with medical history of RCC clear cell type s/p left nephrectomy in 2007 with metastasis to bone presented to clinic with persistent cough and submassive hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy revealed tracheal mass nearly obstructing the tracheal lumen 1 cm proximal to main carina. Endobronchial biopsy, cytology brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage were all negative for malignant cells. PET/CT showed avidity with SUV 5.0 in distal trachea. Multidisciplinary discussion occurred and decision was made to proceed with SBRT for presumptive metastatic renal cell carcinoma with tracheal invasion. Patient completed 5000 cGy radiation in 5 equal fractions with improvement in symptoms. Repeat bronchoscopy 4 months after SBRT therapy revealed necrotic tracheal tissue with concern of mediastinitis. Hospitalization 5 months after SBRT was due to recurrence of submassive hemoptysis. Repeat CT chest revealed acute mediastinitis with aortic ulceration of ascending aorta. Patient also reported expectorating pieces of thick tissue found to be remnants of tracheal cartilage. Rapid decline in hemodynamic status ensued and patient subsequently exsanguinated from ultimate aortic perforation. DISCUSSION: Without definitive therapy this patient would almost certainly have died of metastatic carcinoma to trachea. The patient could also die from aggressive treatment in context of treatment-related complications affecting lung parenchyma and adjacent vasculature. Conclusion(s): SBRT continuously evolves and is at the precipice of the technological advancements in image guidance, dosimetric parameters, and radiation delivery to direct radiation ablation doses to tumors. Careful evaluation and management of patients in multidisciplinary clinical setting, as well as a very thorough informed consent process are essential to ensuring the best possible treatment and outcome.",Excluded
1768,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are epigenetically regulated in a tissue-specific manner Exposure of animal body parts to ionizing radiation (IR) can lead to molecular changes in distant shielded ""bystander"" tissues and organs. Nevertheless, tissue specificity of bystander responses within the same organism has not been examined in detail. Studies on in vivo bystander effect conducted so far analyzed changes induced by single-dose exposure. The potential of fractionated irradiation to induce bystander effects in vivo has never been studied. We analyzed changes in global DNA methylation and microRNAome in skin and spleen of animals subjected to single-dose (acute or fractionated) whole-body or cranial exposure to 0.5 Gy of X-rays. We found that IR-induced DNA methylation changes in bystander spleen and skin were distinct. Acute radiation exposure resulted in a significant loss of global DNA methylation in the exposed and bystander spleen 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after irradiation. Fractionated irradiation led to hypomethylation in bystander spleen 6 hr after whole-body exposure, and 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after cranial irradiation. Contrarily, changes in the skin of the same animals were seen only 6 hr after acute whole-body and head exposure. DNA hypomethylation observed in spleen was paralleled by a reduction of methyl-binding protein MeCP2 expression. Irradiation also induced tissue-specific microRNAome alterations in skin and spleen. For the first time, we have shown that IR-induced epigenetic bystander effects that occur in the same organism are triggered by both acute and fractionated exposure and are very distinct in different bystander organs. Future studies are clearly needed to address organismal and carcinogenic repercussions of those changes.",Included
1724,"Redox balance- and radiation-mediated alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis Changes in the intracellular and extracellular redox balance have been correlated with cell fate decisions in terms of proliferation versus differentiation, entering versus existing cell cycle and survival versus cell death. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been correlated with neuronal plasticity of learning and memory; however, the process is exquisitely sensitive to changes in redox balance. Cranial irradiation is an effective modality in treating brain tumours but often leads to deficits in hippocampus-related learning and memory, which is most likely due to sustained elevation of oxygen free radical production and suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. The subcellular redox environment affecting hippocampal neurogenesis is largely unknown. Using mutant mice deficient in each one of the three superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) isoforms, we have begun to determine the consequences of SOD deficiency in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions of learning and memory under normal condition and following cranial irradiation.",Excluded

Compound (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT possesses high binding potency and selectivity towards VAChT (K<inf>i-VAChT</inf> = 0.59 nM, K<inf>i-sigma1, sigma2</inf> > 10,000 nM). Here we report the radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT in rodent and nonhuman primates. Methods (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized by a two-step alkylation of the phenol precursor. Biodistribution studies were performed in male SD rats at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min post injection. MicroPET studies were performed in male cynomolgus monkeys (4-6 Kg) using a microPET Focus 220 scanner. Dosimetry studies were performed in one female and two male monkeys. Results (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized in high specific activity (>2 Ci/mumol, EOB) and a yield of 30-45% (decay corrected). Biodistribution studies revealed that (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT specifically accumulates in VAChT-enriched striatum area: at 60 min, the uptake(s) (ID%/g) in striatum, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum are 0.82, 0.43, 0.42, 0.45 and 0.29 repectively. No significant defluorination was observed. The uptake in striatum versus cerebellum reached 2.8-fold at 60 min post-injection. MicroPET brain imaging studies in nonhuman primates revealed that the striatum has the highest uptake and displayed clear striatum-to-cerebellum contrast (2.6-fold ratio). Dosimetry studies suggested that injection of 20 mCi into humans will not exceed allowable radiation exposure. Conclusions (-)-[18F]VAT is a promising PET tracer for quantifying the expression of VAChT in the brain of animals. These promising in vivo animal results permit us to seek IND and RDRC approval for translational clinical investigation in human subjects.",Excluded

Her medical history included osteoporosis and endometrial cancer that was treated with radiation therapy to the pelvis 1 year prior to presentation. Despite bed rest, analgesics, and therapeutic modalities, her pain remained intractable and prevented ambulation. Plain radiographs showed no fracture. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging showed fractures of the pelvis but were suggestive of malignancy. CT-guided bone biopsy was consistent with radiation osteonecrosis. After diagnosis and continued therapy, the patient progressed to ambulation with moderate discomfort. Failure to diagnose insufficiency fractures could lead to further pelvic irradiation, compromising already weakened bones and causing prolonged disability.",Excluded
2232,"Evaluation of metastases in the submandibular gland in head and neck malignancy BACKGROUND: : Either excision of the submandibular gland during neck dissection or having the submandibular gland in radiation field can result in xerostomia, leading to reduced quality of life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of metastasis to the submandibular gland and to identify potential risk factors leading to the presence of metastases into the gland.PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Of 376 patients with head and neck malignancy who were treated between 1999 and 2008, 130 patients underwent a neck dissection, and in total, 171 submandibular glands were removed. The average age was 61.1 years.RESULTS: : Twenty-three patients (17.7%) revealed some type of pathology in the submandibular gland such as chronic sialadenitis (15), atrophy (5), tumor infiltration (5), and intraglandular lymph node (1). In the group with sialadenitis, the mean age was 57.7 years. Forty-four percent had a pretreatment (radiation, 9%; local resection, 13%; or combined therapy, 22%) before neck dissection. Of the sialadenitis group, 9 of 12 patients had the primary tumor in the lower jaw, floor of mouth, or tongue.CONCLUSIONS: : One needs to be aware of the possibility of occult metastases in level I in oral cavity carcinomas, whereas oropharynx carcinoma constitutes a lower risk for involvement of lymph node metastases at level I. The excision of the submandibular gland should be performed in cases with positive lymph nodes at level I and in tumor sites with a high risk of occult metastasis at level I.",Excluded
1301,"Alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. [Polish] Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is currently widely used in the treatment of patients with lung cancer, but despite that the data on alopecia after this type of treatment are limited. Aim. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing the duration of alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. Material and methods. Two groups of patients were analyzed: group I - 34 patients radically treated fornon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and group II - 18 patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In group I 12 patients were treated with radiotherapy only, the remaining patients were treated with neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin + vinorelbin: PN or cisplatin + gemcitabin: PG) in 2 to 6 cycles. PCI was administered during the last tree weeks of thoracic irradiation or >=2 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy and consisted of 15 fractions of 2 Gy per day (30 Gy), 5 days per week. Patients from group II received 25 Gy in 10 fractions starting from the second week of thoracic irradiation; chemotherapy (cisplatin + vepesid: PE every 21 days) started concurrently with thoracic irradiation. Results. Alopecia occurred in all patients treated with PCI; hair loss began 2-3 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In group I full re-growth of hair occurred in 33 patients, one patient died during treatment, before hair re-growth had the chance to take place. Time to re-growth (TRG) was 1.5-6 months, median 2.5 months. In this group we observed a trend towards longer re-growths in patients who had received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.07). In group II hair re-growths occurred between 5 and 12 months after the completion of treatment, with median time of 10 months, and was significantly longer than in group I. Conclusion. The results suggest that the most important factor for TRG is the type and the number of chemotherapy cycles.",Excluded
1394,"Analyses of prognostic factors in cases of non-small cell lung cancer with multiple brain metastases Aim: To observe the therapeutic efficacy and prognostic factors that influence survival rates in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with multiple brain metastases (BMs), (more than three and less than ten). Method(s): Retrospective analyses were conducted on the clinical data of 209 NSCLC patients with multiple BMs and were admitted to our hospital between March 2007 and November 2012. All BM patients received whole-brain radiotherapy. Two hundred patients received combined chemotherapy during the treatment process; 99 received targeted drug therapy; and nine got only symptomatic and supportive treatment. Survival time was defined as the period from the start of BM therapy to the patient's death or end of the follow-up period. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the median survival time, and the 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates, as well as to plot the survival curves. The patients' cultural background included their socioeconomic status, level of education, their understanding of the disease, and the degree of care and support they received from their family members. Log-rank test was employed to test the differences in the survival rates between the subgroups. Cox multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze the various factors influencing the prognoses of NSCLC with multiple BMs. Result(s): The follow-up duration was between 1 and 87 months. The median survival time for all BM patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 9.37-14.83). The 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates were 80%, 50.2%, and 10.7%, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that the independent factors influencing survival prognoses included Karnofsky Performance Status score, control of the primary lung tumor, interval between the confirmed diagnoses of lung cancer and BM, presence of extracranial metastasis, number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, Graded Prognostic Assessment class, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, the pathological type, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients. Multivariate analyses indicated that the number of chemotherapy cycles, administration of combined drug therapy, and patients' cultural background were key independent factors influencing survival prognoses. Conclusion(s): Active treatment of NSCLC with multiple BMs was beneficial, and the patients' cultural background had a strong influence on survival prognoses. Chemotherapy combined with targeted drug therapy could increase the patients' median and overall survival rates. The number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients had significant effects on the patients' survival prognoses.

2018,"Dynamic instability of sheared microtubules observed by quasi-elastic light scattering The kinetics of microtubule reassembly was studied in vitro by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). When microtubules assembled in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were sheared, they rapidly depolymerized, recovered, and reassembled. The mean length of the recovered microtubules was the same as that observed just before shearing, implying that on average one fragment per original microtubule survived the fragmentation and recovery. When microtubules that contained 25 percent brain MAP were sheared, the fragments did not depolymerize extensively and the average length of the fragments decreased by a factor of 3 relative to the unsheared sample. The results support the dynamic instability model, which predicts that cellular microtubules are latently unstable structures protected on their ends by stabilizing caps.",Excluded
