3030,Excluded,"Space cycle: a human-powered centrifuge that can be used for hypergravity resistance training INTRODUCTION: This study represents the first step toward testing the hypothesis that hypergravity can be used as a unique resistance training modality for maintaining the health and function of skeletal muscle in microgravity. The primary objectives of this study were to use a human-powered short-arm centrifuge for the following: 1) to determine whether subjects could perform squats under hypergravity conditions without developing motion sickness or illusory motion; 2) to measure foot forces while performing squats under hypergravity conditions; and 3) to determine the mechanical power required to produce 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz (head to foot) at the feet.METHODS: Subjects (22 males and 19 females) performed 10 squats each at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz on a human-powered short-arm centrifuge, the space cycle. Foot forces during each squat were monitored using insole force sensors, and normalized to foot forces measured at 1 Gz (relative foot forces).RESULTS: Illusory motion was minimized using a visual focal point, and did not affect the ability of subjects to perform squats. The mean standing relative foot forces at 3.0 Gz were 2.3 and 2.4 for the male and female subjects, respectively. The work rate required to power the space cycle was a linear function of Gz, and is well within the aerobic scope of untrained individuals.DISCUSSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that hypergravity can be used as an effective modality for loading skeletal muscle and that subjects can perform squat resistance exercise without developing motion sickness or illusory motion."

2358,Excluded,"Case of a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis presenting with photosensitive attacks State the Purpose: Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. We experienced a patient with photosensitive attacks induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Method(s): A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital because he experienced photosensitive attacks, which first occurred 3 months previously. In the case of our patient, sunlight always induced a photosensitive attack, during which he was blinded for approximately 10 minutes. He did not experience convulsions, loss of consciousness, headache, and symptoms of amaurosis. Ophthalmological examination, electroencephalography, and brain computed tomography (CT) did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient was exposed to cervical radiation for pharyngeal cancer approximately 16 years previously. He did not have migraine, diabetes, and any previous cerebrovascular disease. The patient had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which were not treated appropriately. Result(s): One month after visiting our hospital, he experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIA) with right hemiparesis. Thereafter, the patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed small cerebral infarctions. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no abnormalities; however, ultrasound of the carotid artery showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). Cerebral angiography also showed bilateral ICA stenosis (approximately 90%). A 99m-Technetium- ECD single-photon emission CT scan revealed low bilateral occipital perfusion. Because the bilateral ICA stenosis was induced by radiation, we decided to perform carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) instead of carotid endarterectomy. After CAS of the left carotid artery, the patient's photosensitivity completely disappeared. Conclusion(s): Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. In the present case, photosensitive attacks appear to have been induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion."
2370,Excluded,"Radiosurgical Lesionectomy For Cavernomas Associated With Drug Resistant Epilepsy Purpose/Objective(s): Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain which cause hemorrhage and repetitive neurological deficits but the most frequent presenting symptom is epilepsy and is due to deposition of iron and blood products at the margin of the lesion. Microsurgical excision is preferred for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of SRS in seizure cessation for drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs. Materials/Methods: This retrospective single center study where in 11 patients with cortical or subcortical CMs located in highly functional areas with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these SRS procedures was 6yrs (+/-2.4) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 5 /month (+/-12). The mean marginal radiation dose was 18.5 Gy. Result(s): At median follow-up of 38mo, 54% were seizure free (Engel's class I), including 5 in class IA and 1 of the patients with occasional auras. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for 27% pts (class IIB). The remaining 19% patients showed little or no improvement. Outcomes were better for patients with simple partial seizures than for those with complex partial seizures. Location in the mesio-temporal region was associated with a poor outcome (2 of 11 patients), whereas location in the latero-temporal region was associated with a good outcome (5 of 11 patients). Location in the central region was also associated with an excellent outcome. Radiologically, 6 patients presented major reactional edema during the first year after SRS. In 2 of these patients, neuroradiological alterations were associated with clinical manifestations which included severe hemiparesis and speech impairment, but both patients fully recovered during the follow-up period with steroids. Post reactional edema correlates well with the response to the therapy. Conclusion(s): While radiosurgery role in controlling the bleeding in CM is controversial, it is a promising modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome. Further prospective work is necessary. Copyright Â© 2020"
2709,Excluded,"Repeated delayed onset cerebellar radiation injuries after linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma A 63-year-old woman presented with right hearing disturbance and vertigo. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed the presence of right vestibular schwannoma (VS). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was performed with a tumor marginal dose of 14 Gy using two isocenters. She was followed up clinically and neuroradiologically using three-dimensional spoiled gradient-echo MR imaging. She experienced temporal neurological deterioration due to peritumoral edema in her right cerebellar peduncle and pons for a few months beginning 1.5 years after SRS, when she experienced transient right facial dysesthesia and hearing deterioration. Ten years after SRS, the patient presented with sudden onset of vertigo, gait disturbance, diplopia, dysarthria, and nausea. MR imaging demonstrated a new lesion in the right cerebellar peduncle, which was diagnosed as radiation-induced stroke. The patient was followed up conservatively and her symptoms disappeared within a few months.Multiple delayed onset radiation injuries are possible sequelae of SRS for VS."
1428,Excluded,"Small cell cancer of the anal canal - Case report of a rare tumor Background: We report on a rare case of small cell cancer located at the anal canal. Case report: A 41-year old woman presented with locally advanced small cell anal cancer and simultaneous hepatic and pulmonal deposits. Due to metastatic disease, chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin was performed with mixed response after four cycles of chemotherapy. After application of two additional chemotherapy cycles, locally progressive disease occurred causing symptomatic bowel obstruction. Pelvic irradiation was started and several days later, additional irradiation of cerebral metastases was initiated due to rapid progression of distant disease. Despite adequate local treatment the patient's condition further deteriorated and irradiation was stopped. The patient died 10 months after initial diagnosis due to rapid tumor progression. Conclusion(s): In patients with metastatic small cell anal cancer chemotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy. Radiotherapy exerts additional activity and remains a prime choice to gain local control and ameliorate symptoms. Careful histopathological examination, together with immunohistochemistry, is needed to determine the therapeutic strategy to be followed."
1566,Excluded,"Resident microglia, and not peripheral macrophages, are the main source of brain tumor mononuclear cells Gliomas consist of multiple cell types, including an abundant number of microglia and macrophages, whereby their impact on tumor progression is controversially discussed. To understand their unique functions and consequently manipulate either microglia or macrophages in therapeutic approaches, it is essential to discriminate between both cell populations. Because of the lack of specific markers, generally total body irradiated chimeras with labeled bone marrow cells were used to identify infiltrated cells within the brain. However, total body irradiation (TBI) affects the blood-brain barrier integrity, which in turn potentially facilitates immune cell infiltration. In this study, changes on the blood-brain barrier were avoided using head-protected irradiation (HPI). Head protection and total body irradiated chimeras exhibited similar reconstitution levels of the myeloid cell lineage in the blood, enabling the comparable analyses of brain infiltrates. We demonstrate that the HPI model impeded a massive unspecific influx of donor-derived myeloid cells into naive as well as tumor-bearing brains. Moreover, experimental artifacts such as an enlarged distribution of infiltrated cells and fourfold increased tumor volumes are prevented in head-protected chimeras. In addition, our data evidenced for the first time that microglia are able to up-regulate CD45 and represent an inherent part of the CD45(high) population in the tumor context. All in all, HPI allowed for the unequivocal distinction between microglia and macrophages without alterations of tumor biology and consequently permits a detailed and realistic description of the myeloid cell composition in gliomas."
1302,Excluded,"The incidence of myelitis after irradiation of the cervical spinal cord To further define the tolerance of the cervical spinal cord, the dose of radiation to the cervical spinal cord was calculated for all 2901 patients with malignancies of the upper respiratory tract treated at the University of Florida between October 1964 and December 1987. To further define the population evaluated, certain criteria were used: (a) a minimum of 3000 cGy to at least 2 cm of cervical spinal cord and (b) a minimum of 1 year of follow-up, unless a neurological complication occurred before 1 year. A total of 1112 patients were evaluable, of which 2 (0.18%) developed radiation myelitis. One received 4658 cGy to the cervical cord at 172.5 cGy per day, and the other patient received 4907 cGy to the cord at 169.2 cGy per day. The risk of myelitis at each dose level was 0/124 at 3000-3999 cGy, 0/442 at 4000-4499 cGy, 2/471 at 4500-4999 cGy, and 0/75 at a cord dose of 5000 cGy or greater."

519,Excluded,"Severity of esas symptoms in patients attending an outpatient palliative radiation clinic Introduction Cancer patients experience a multitude of symptoms that reduce their quality of life. Objectives To identify the frequency of severe symptoms as reported with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) by advanced cancer patients who presented to an outpatient radiation clinic. Methods A prospective study was conducted including patient demographics and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) score at first visit. ESAS assessed pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, loss of appetite, general well-being, dyspnea, and the additional symptom of constipation from a score of 0 to 10. Symptom scores from 7-10 were considered severe. Results 182 patients with 263 visits were included (median age 70.5 years, 58% male). The most common cancers were prostate (24.7%), lung (24.7%), and breast (13.7%). The median KPS score was 70.0 and ranged from 30-100. 84.4% of patients had bone metastases, 25.8% had lymph metasta-ses, 23.6% had lung metastases, and 21.4% had brain metastases. Symptoms were reported as being severe for constipation (46.7% of patients), tiredness (30.2%), pain (28.2%), general well-being (22.8%), loss of appetite (16.6%), anxiety (15.0%), drowsiness (13.8%), depression (12.1%), dyspnea (7.2%), and nausea (2.8%). Conclusions Patients presenting to a palliative radiotherapy clinic had a multitude of symptoms, with constipation, tiredness and pain being the most common severe symptoms. Healthcare professionals should be aware of these symptoms when prescribing treatment."
2271,Excluded,"Re-irradiation of pituitary adenoma Fifteen patients initially irradiated for pituitary adenoma were subsequently treated with a second course of radiotherapy at the University of California at San Francisco between 1961 and 1989. The re-irradiation followed surgery in all but two cases. The median time to recurrence was 9 years (range 2-17) and median follow-up after the second course of radiotherapy was 10 years (range 1-30). The median initial radiation dose was 4084 cGy; that at recurrence was 4200 cGy. Local control has been maintained in 12 patients. One failed locally with a benign adenoma that was surgically salvaged. Two developed pituitary carcinomas which were poorly controlled. Of the patients who presented with visual abnormalities at the time of recurrence, 50% improved and the remainder stabilized after re-irradiation. There are no long-term visual complications. Hypopituitarism was present in nine patients prior to the second course of radiotherapy and developed in the remaining six patients after re-irradiation. Temporal lobe injury was seen in two patients. Careful analysis of each patient's pituitary and temporal lobe doses, intervals between treatments, treatment volume, neurets, relative decay factors, absolute decay factors, TDF and modified LQF values, and dose-volume relationships, revealed no correlation with complication or likelihood of local control. Repeat radiotherapy for recurrent pituitary adenoma with the doses used in these patients appears to carry acceptable risk with good local control."
2484,Excluded,"Helical tomotherapy: Experiences of the first 150 patients in Heidelberg Background and Purpose: Helical tomotherapy was introduced into clinical routine at the Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Heidelberg, Germany, in July 2006. This report is intended to describe the experience with the first 150 patients treated with helical tomotherapy. Patient selection, time effort, handling of daily image guidance with megavoltage (MV) CT, and quality of radiation plans shall be assessed. Patients and Methods: Between July 2006 and May 2007, 150 patients were treated with helical tomotherapy in the University Hospital of Heidelberg. Mean age was 60 years with a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 85 years. 79 of these patients received radiotherapy as a part of multimodal treatment pre- or postoperatively, 17 patients received treatment as a combined radiochemotherapy. 76% were treated with curative intent. Radiotherapy sites were central nervous system (n = 7), head and neck (n = 28), thoracic (n = 37), abdominal (n = 58) and skeletal system (n = 20). Most common tumor entities were prostate cancer (n = 28), breast cancer (n = 17), gastrointestinal tumors (n = 19), pharyngeal carcinoma (n = 14), lymphoma (n = 13), metastatic disease (bone n = 14, liver n = 6, lung n = 4, lymph node n = 2), sarcoma (n = 8), malignant pleural mesothelioma (n = 5), ovarian cancer treated with whole abdominal irradiation (n = 4), lung cancer (n = 3), skin malignancies (n = 3), chordoma (n = 2), meningioma (n = 2), one ependymoma and one medulloblastoma treated with craniospinal axis irradiation (n = 2), and others (n = 4). Nine patients were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery, nine with image-guided spinal reirradiation, and twelve patients were treated at multiple targets simultaneously. A pretreatment MV-CT scan was performed in 98.2% of the 3,026 fractions applied. After matching with the kilovoltage planning CT, corrections for translations and rotation around longitudinal axis (roll) were done. Result(s): Mean time on table was 24.8 min for the mentioned tumor entities with fractionated radiation, mean treatment time 10.7 min. Mean correction vector after MV-CT registration was 6.9 mm. With helical tomotherapy it was possible to achieve highly conformal dose distributions for targets of all sizes and multiple targets within one procedure. Image guidance with MV-CT allowed daily position correction and safe and precise treatment application. This was feasible even if the desired immobilization was not possible due to obesity, claustrophobia, pain, or neurologic or orthopedic impairment. Conclusion(s): Helical tomotherapy and daily image guidance with MV-CT could fast be introduced into daily clinical routine. This technique allows precise intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in standard cases and offers new treatment options in a huge variety of difficult cases. Â© 2008 Urban & Vogel."
2316,Excluded,"Brain dysplasia evoked by gamma irradiation at different stages of prenatal development leads to different tonic and clonic seizure reactivity Rats with brain dysplasia evoked by interruption of different stages of prenatal neurogenesis show characteristic variations in susceptibility to seizures depending on the neurochemical specificity of pharmacological agents used to evoke seizures. To verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. To produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0. Gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. From the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (E13s, E15s, E17s and E19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. Profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. E17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. On the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in E13s and E15s. Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) were observed exclusively in E15s and E17s. Generally, the size of PNHs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. Analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. E13s and E19s had brains devoid PNHs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in E15s. It can therefore be concluded that PNHs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of PNHs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself.

1160,Included,"Radiation post-traumatic stress disorder Background: Whether PTSD following radiation emergency has psychopathological, neurocognitive and neurophysiological peculiarities is at issue. Goal: To explore features and cerebral basis of ""radiation"" PTSD in the Chernobyl accident survivors. Subjects and methods: The cross-sectional study included 241 people, 219 of whom have been diagnosed with PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, among them 115 clean-up workers [liquidators] of the Chernobyl accident (34 with acute radiation sickness), 76 evacuees from the Chernobyl exclusion zone, 28 veterans of the war in Afghanistan, and 22 healthy unexposed individuals. Psychometric examinations, neurocognitive assessments, computerized electroencephalography, and cerebral vascular Doppler were used. Result(s): ""Radiation"" PTSD includes: ""flashforward"" phenomenon and anticipating stress (projection of fear and danger to the future); somatoform disorders, depression, trait and state anxiety; neurocognitive deficit (impaired memory and attention, auditory-verbal memory and learning, proactive and retroactive interference; cerebellar and stem symptoms, intellectual changes). The intima-media component thickness of common carotid arteries, and common and left internal carotid arteries stenosis rates are increased in the liquidators. Changes of bioelectrical brain activity as a decrease of beta- and theta-power together with an increase of alpha-power were found in the Chernobyl accident survivors with PTSD. Conclusion(s): PTSD following radiation emergency is characterized by comorbidity of psychopathology, neurocognitive deficit, and cerebrovascular pathology with increased risk of cerebral atherosclerosis and stroke. Cerebral basis of this PTSD is proposed to be an abnormal communication between the pyramidal cells of neocortex and hippocampus, and deep brain structures."
2544,Excluded,"Three-dimensional image fusion is associated with lower radiation exposure and shorter time to carotid cannulation during carotid artery stenting OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) image fusion is associated with lower radiation exposure, contrast agent dose, and operative time during endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of this technology on carotid artery stenting (CAS).METHODS: We identified consecutive CAS procedures from 2009 to 2017 and compared those performed with and without 3D image fusion. For image fusion, we created a 3D reconstruction of the aortic arch anatomy based on preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography that we merged with two-dimensional fluoroscopy, allowing 3D image overlay. We compared radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, contrast agent dose, time to common carotid artery (CCA) cannulation, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, and total procedure time in procedures with and without image fusion. We also assessed rates of 30-day stroke/death, in-hospital and 30-day stroke, and acute kidney injury. We used multivariable linear regression to adjust for patient and procedural characteristics and used these models to compute the marginal effects of image fusion compared with no image fusion.RESULTS: There were 46 patients who underwent CAS with a 3D image fusion system and 70 patients without. Patients undergoing CAS with image fusion experienced 31% lower radiation exposure compared with the control group (207 +/- 23 mGy vs 300 +/- 26 mGy, respectively; P < .01), shorter fluoroscopy time (21 +/- 6 minutes vs 24 +/- 8 minutes; P = .02), shorter time to carotid cannulation (21 +/- 9 minutes vs 31 +/- 8 minutes; P < .001), and shorter total procedure time (47 +/- 13 minutes vs 54 +/- 18 minutes; P = .03). There was no difference in contrast material volume, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, or total in-room time. After multivariable adjustment, 3D image fusion remained associated with lower radiation dose, shorter fluoroscopy time, and shorter time to carotid cannulation (all P < .05). The rate of 30-day stroke/death was 2.7% (three strokes and no deaths at 30 days), and the rate of acute kidney injury was 1.8%.CONCLUSIONS: CAS with 3D image fusion was associated with lower radiation exposure and shorter time to CCA cannulation. These results represent the potential technical advantage gained with image fusion and add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating its impact on radiation exposure and operative times during complex endovascular procedures."
678,Excluded,"Presenilin 1 deficiency alters the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cultured cortical neurons Presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2, respectively) play a critical role in mediating gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Numerous mutations in the presenilins are known to cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In addition, it is well established that PS1 deficiency leads to altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis involving endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. However, there has been little evidence suggesting Ca(2+) signals from extracellular sources are influenced by PS1. Here we report that the Ca(2+) currents carried by voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are increased in PS1-deficient cortical neurons. This increase is mediated by a significant increase in the contributions of L- and P-type Ca(2+) channels to the total voltage-mediated Ca(2+) conductance in PS1 (-/-) neurons. In addition, chelating intracellular Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) produced an increase in Ca(2+) current amplitude that was comparable to the increase caused by PS1 deficiency. In contrast to this, BAPTA had no effect on voltage-dependent Ca(2+) conductances in PS1-deficient neurons. These data suggest that PS1 deficiency may influence voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel function by means that involve intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. These findings reveal that PS1 functions at multiple levels to regulate and stabilize intracellular Ca(2+) levels that ultimately control neuronal firing behavior and influence synaptic transmission."
1986,Excluded,"Improved survival for elderly married glioblastoma patients : Better treatment delivery, less toxicity, and fewer disease complications OBJECTIVES: Marital status is a well-described prognostic factor in patients with gliomas but the observed survival difference is unexplained in the available population-based studies.METHODS: A series of 57 elderly glioblastoma patients (>=70 years) were analyzed retrospectively. Patients received radiotherapy or chemoradiation with temozolomide. The prognostic significance of marital status was assessed. Disease complications, toxicity, and treatment delivery were evaluated in detail.RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly higher in married than in unmarried patients (median, 7.9 vs. 4.0 months; p = 0.006). The prognostic significance of marital status was preserved in the multivariate analysis (HR, 0.41; p = 0.011). Married patients could receive significantly higher daily temozolomide doses (mean, 53.7 mg/m2 vs. 33.1 mg/m2; p = 0.020), were more likely to receive maintenance temozolomide (45.7 % vs. 11.8 %; p = 0.016), and had to be hospitalized less frequently during radiotherapy (55.0 % vs. 88.2 %; p = 0.016). Of the patients receiving temozolomide, married patients showed significantly lower rates of hematologic and liver toxicity. Most complications were infectious or neurologic in nature. Complications of any grade were more frequent in unmarried patients (58.8 % vs. 30.0 %; p = 0.041) with the incidence of grade 3-5 complications being particularly elevated (47.1 % vs. 15.0 %; p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: We found poorer treatment delivery as well as an unexpected severe increase in toxicity and disease complications in elderly unmarried glioblastoma patients. Marital status may be an important predictive factor for clinical decision-making and should be addressed in further studies."
648,Excluded,"Neuroinflammatory changes of the normal brain tissue in cured mice following combined radiation and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy for glioma The efficacy of combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor blockade to treat brain tumors is currently the subject of multiple investigations and holds significant therapeutic promise. However, the long-term effects of this combination therapy on the normal brain tissue are unknown. Here, we examined mice that were intracranially implanted with murine glioma cell line and became long-term survivors after treatment with a combination of 10 Gy cranial irradiation (RT) and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (aPD-1). Post-mortem analysis of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to tumor implantation showed complete abolishment of hippocampal neurogenesis, but neural stem cells were well preserved in subventricular zone. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, this observation was evident specifically in the combined (RT+aPD-1) treatment group but not in the single treatment arm of either RT alone or aPD-1 alone. Elimination of microglia with a small molecule inhibitor of colony stimulated factor-1 receptor (PLX5622) prevented the loss of mature oligodendrocytes. These results identify for the first time a unique pattern of normal tissue changes in the brain secondary to combination treatment with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The results also suggest a role for microglia as key mediators of the adverse treatment effect."
2575,Included,"Collateral damage of radiation to normal tissues: What can the retina tell us? Purpose : Damage to normal tissue in an irradiated field (normal tissue injury, NTI) is a complication of radiation therapy believed to be caused by microvessel pathology. In the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), vascular pathology was described in uveal melanoma (UM) patients 2 years post-radiation therapy. However, the COMS and other studies used subjective scoring systems, lacked a control group, did not assess neuronal function in detail, and used dosimetry methods simplified for clinical application. Methods : Optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) was used to characterize vascular pathology by vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size, parafoveal density (PVD), and by machine learning-derived density maps. OCT-derived retinal layer thickness and 10-2 visual field testing (VF) were used to quantify corresponding neuronal loss and dysfunction. Patient-specific 3D dosimetry models were constructed to spatially correlate dose to each outcome measure. Measurements were taken in both eyes of 31 UM patients at 0.5-150 mo post-<sup>125</sup>I plaque brachytherapy, and 16 age-matched controls. Data were normalized to the contralateral eye to account for subject variation due to age or systemic disease. Results : Abnormal vessel density, FD, lacunarity, FAZ size, and PVD were observed after 24 mo in 25 out of 31 subjects, whereas only 6 subjects showed any vascular pathology before 24 mo. Visual acuity was the least sensitive indicator of adverse outcome, with only 16% of the entire population showing a visual decline of two or more Snellen lines since diagnosis. Neuronal dysfunction by VF correlated strongly with most measures, especially vessel density, thinning of the superficial retina, and radiation dose (p<0.001). Abnormalities were observed only at doses above 20 Gy. Conclusions : Using a series of quantitative approaches, radiation microvasculopathy was detected starting at 24 mo post-exposure in most patients. Strong correlations between loss of neuronal function, vascular pathology, and dose were observed. Prospective studies will help determine whether vascular pathology precedes neuronal loss."
753,Excluded,"Vision loss following high-dose proton-based radiotherapy for skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: Dose escalation for skull-based chordoma and chondrosarcoma can put critical adjacent structures at risk, specifically the anterior optic pathway. We report the incidence of vision loss following high-dose conformal proton-based radiotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed patients with skull-base chordoma or chondrosarcoma treated with proton-based therapy between 2007 and 2018. We analyzed 148 patients and 283 individual eyes with functional vision at baseline who received a minimum 30GyRBE to 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup> of the anterior optic pathway. Eyes were classified as ""functionally blind"" if visual acuity was 20/200 or worse. Kaplan-Meier and normal tissue complication probability modeling were used to establish the relationship between radiation dose and risk of functional vision loss.RESULTS: At last follow-up, 110 of 148 patients were alive with no evidence of disease progression. With a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 0.5-12.8), 5 eyes in 3 patients developed functional blindness, with 2 patients developing bilateral blindness. Median time to blindness was 15.2 months. The 5-year incidence of vision loss was 2.1% (95% CI: 0.9-4.9%). On univariate analysis, development of blindness was associated with presence of multiple medical comorbidities (p = 0.0040). While there were no events with a maximum dose < 60GyRBE delivered to the anterior optic pathway, the crude rate was 3.6% over 60GyRBE, with all events occurring between 60-65GyRBE.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high radiotherapy dose delivered to patients with skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma, the rate of vision loss is low and no events occurred in those who received a maximum dose under 60GyRBE."

In studies investigating methylation and the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the effect of this treatment upon the methylation itself is not well understood. We aimed to investigate any differences in methylation before or after treatment. Method(s): Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer were identified. Tumour tissue from pretreatment biopsies and post treatment resections for the same patients was subjected to DNA extraction. This was also modelled in vitro by administering ionizing radiation (7-15 Gy) to a colorectal cancer cell line and extracting DNA 48 hour later. Methylation specific PCR was used to characterize the methylation status of CpG islands in the promoter regions of 8 genes associated with rectal cancer. PCR band size and intensity was measured to give a semiquantiative analysis of methylation intensity in the cell line experiment. Result(s): 17 patients underwent analysis. Methylation was seen less frequently in post treatment specimens for all 8 markers, however, this difference was significant for one marker (ADAMTS1, 10/17 methylated pre vs 0/17 post, P = 0.001) and approached significance for another (hMLH1, 6/17 vs 1/17, P = 0.08). In the cell line study, methylation band intensity was significantly reduced above a dose of 10 Gy for both ADAMTS1 (P = 0.05) and NEUROG1 (P < 0.05) markers. Conclusion(s): Ionizing radiation appears to affect rectal cancer DNA methylation in patients and in an in vitro model. Further studies into this phenomenon are indicated, however, investigators should consider this when studying DNA methylation in patients undergoing radiation therapy."
3159,Excluded,"Contribution to the pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to large arteries We report a case of a 35-year-old man who died of a brain infarct 20 months after radiotherapy for carcinoma of the tonsil with metastases to the cervical lymph nodes. Histology revealed mild atherosclerosis, necrotizing vasculitis, and occlusive thrombosis of the internal carotid artery. Significant changes were observed in the vasa vasorum: swelling and detachment of the endothelium, subendothelial oedema, hyaline change, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls with mononuclear cellular infiltration, accompanied by focal haemorrhages and chronic inflammation in the periadventitial soft tissue. We believe that these changes of the vasa vasorum and necrotizing vasculitis are causally related and that vasculitis represents focal ischaemic necroses with inflammatory reaction. Our findings support the hypothesis, based on experimental studies, that injury to the vasa vasorum is an important mechanism in the development of radiation-induced vasculopathy of large arteries. They also suggest an evolution of the injury to the vasa vasorum and periadventitial tissue from the early lesions described in our patient, to late stages resulting in dense periadventitial fibrosis as reported previously. We suggest that injury to the vasa vasorum and the consequent ischaemic lesions of the arterial wall are morphological features distinguishing radiation-induced arterial injury from spontaneous atherosclerosis."

It also raised brain cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and calcium (Ca(2+)) level. Furthermore, I/R provoked an inflammatory response reflected by an increment in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interlukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Moreover, induction of I/R in irradiated rats resulted in a further increase in brain oxidative stress and cytosolic LDH activity, disturbed brain Ca(2+) homeostasis and exaggerated the inflammatory reaction. During irradiation, administration of each of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and rutin to irradiated rats before induction of I/R, alleviated the brain oxidative stress. Moreover, these antioxidants caused attenuation of the rise of the cytosolic activities of GPx and GR. A lowering effect of the cytosolic LDH activity and Ca(2+) level were caused by treatment with antioxidants. Each of vitamin E and rutin revealed an anti-inflammatory action of these antioxidants, while CoQ10 had no effect on serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that supplementation with either vitamin E, CoQ10 or rutin ameliorated most of the biochemical changes induced by I/R in irradiated rat brain and serum."
1353,Excluded,"Serotonergic modulation of psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampal CA1 field In order to elucidate possible involvement of the serotonergic neuronal system in the stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, the effects of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 field were examined in 5-HT-depleted rats by pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 200 microg/rat, i.c.v.). LTP induction was suppressed by footshock (FS) stimulation in 5-HT-lesioned rats and vehicle-treated controls. When rats were exposed to CFC, which was received 24 h after FS stimulation, LTP was also blocked in both-treated groups. CFC-induced impairment of LTP, however, significantly attenuated in 5-HT-lesioned rats when compared with that in controls. Fear-related freezing behavior after FS stimulation occurred similarly in both treated groups, whereas the behavior observed during exposure to CFC significantly reduced in 5-HT-lesioned rats. These results suggest that the serotonergic mechanism is involved in the psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be associated with fear-related behavior."
353,Included,"Senile amyloidosis and neuron binding antibody in the aging Syrian hamster The effects of age, sex, and irradiation on the genesis of amyloidosis, neuron-binding antibody (NBA), and the concomitant appearance of these two phenomena were studied in a colony of Syrian hamsters. In nonirradiated controls amyloidosis increased in prevalence with age after 12 months, and prevalence was higher in females than in males. Irradiation had the effect of advancing the appearance of amyloidosis to the 7-12 months group but did not intensify the amyloidotic process. IgG binding to the nucleus or cytoplasm of neurons was rare, and, despite the fact that IgM and IgA binding to these structures was present in about one-third of the animals, there was neither an aging nor an irradiation effect. The only statistically significant findings with respect to the concomitant occurrence of amyloid and NBA were negative correlations between nuclear IgM and IgA binding and amyloidosis. Of the various species thus far studied, the hamster is the first in which there has been no aging effect in respect to NBA."
1377,Excluded,"Intron and gene size expansion during nervous system evolution BACKGROUND: The evolutionary radiation of animals was accompanied by extensive expansion of gene and genome sizes, increased isoform diversity, and complexity of regulation.RESULTS: Here we show that the longest genes are enriched for expression in neuronal tissues of diverse vertebrates and of invertebrates. Additionally, we show that neuronal gene size expansion occurred predominantly through net gains in intron size, with a positional bias toward the 5' end of each gene.CONCLUSIONS: We find that intron and gene size expansion is a feature of many genes whose expression is enriched in nervous systems. We speculate that unique attributes of neurons may subject neuronal genes to evolutionary forces favoring net size expansion. This process could be associated with tissue-specific constraints on gene function and/or the evolution of increasingly complex gene regulation in nervous systems."
2558,Included,"X-irradiation causes a prolonged reduction in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of adult rats The effects of X-irradiation on proliferating cells in the dentate subgranular zone were assessed in young adult Fisher 344 rats exposed to a range of X-ray doses and followed for up to 120 days. Apoptosis was quantified using morphology and end-labeling immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation was detected using antibodies against the thymidine analog BrdU and the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2). Radiation-induced apoptosis occurred rapidly, with maximum morphological and end-labeling changes observed 3-6h after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to sham-irradiated controls. The number of apoptotic nuclei increased rapidly with radiation dose, reaching a plateau at about 3Gy. The maximum number of apoptotic nuclei was substantially higher than the number of proliferating cells, suggesting that non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells in the subgranular zone were sensitive to irradiation. Subgranular zone cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to age-matched controls 120 days after doses of 5Gy or higher. These findings suggest that neural precursor cells of the dentate gyrus are very sensitive to irradiation and are not capable of repopulating the subgranular zone at least up to 120 days after irradiation. This may help explain, in part, how ionizing irradiation induces cognitive impairments in animals and humans."
1029,Excluded,"Radiation necrosis or glioma recurrence: is computer-assisted stereotactic biopsy useful? Fifty-one patients with supratentorial glioma treated with external beam radiotherapy (median dose 59.5 Gy) who then demonstrated clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression underwent stereotactic biopsy to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis. The original tumor histological type was diffuse or fibrillary astrocytoma in 21 patients (41%), oligodendroglioma in 13 (26%), and oligoastrocytoma in 17 (33%); 40 tumors (78%) were low-grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). The median time to suspected disease progression was 28 months. Stereotactic biopsy showed tumor recurrence in 30 patients (59%), radiation necrosis in three (6%), and a mixture of both in 17 (33%); one patient (2%) had a parenchymal radiation-induced chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The tumor type at stereotactic biopsy was similar to the original tumor type and was astrocytoma in 24 patients (47%), oligodendroglioma in eight (16%), oligoastrocytoma in 16 (31%), unclassifiable in two (4%), and chondroblastic osteosarcoma in one patient (2%). At biopsy, however, only 19 tumors (37%) were low grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). Subsequent surgery confirmed the stereotactic biopsy histological findings in eight patients. Follow-up examination showed 14 patients alive with a median survival of 1 year for the entire group. Median survival times after biopsy were 0.83 year for patients with tumor recurrence and 1.86 years for patients with both tumor recurrence and radionecrosis; these findings were significantly different (p = 0.008, log-rank test). No patient with radiation necrosis alone died. Other factors associated with reduced survival were a high proportion of residual tumor (p = 0.024), a low proportion of radionecrosis (p < 0.001), and a Kernohan Grade of 3 or 4 (p = 0.005). In conclusion, in patients with previously irradiated supratentorial gliomas in whom radionecrosis or tumor recurrence was clinically or radiographically suspected, results of stereotactic biopsy could be used to differentiate tumor recurrence, radiation necrosis, a mixture of both lesions, or radiation-induced neoplasm. In addition, biopsy results could predict survival rates."

Atrophically changed zones of parenchyma were observed along with regions of extra- and intrafollicular hyperplasia with compensatory-adaptive manifestations aimed at hormonopoiesis increase. Growth of sympathetic innervation of the vessel walls and around the follicles were found in areas of high functional activity. Direct contact between adrenergic axons and thyrocytes was demonstrated by means of electron microscopy. In parenchyma areas with signs of atrophia, adrenergic nerve fibers and terminals are located only in vessels. Thus, connection between the state of the thyroid gland sympathetic innervation and structural organization of its parenchyma in distanced terms of radiational effects was followed up."
2193,Excluded,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) presenting as solitary CNS lymphoma: A rare occurrence Introduction: PTLD associated lymphoma is the second most common malignancy in patients receiving SOT or HSCT with an incidence rate of 1%-3%. PCNS-PTLD occurs in 7%-15% of all PTLD cases. We present a case of isolated PCNS lymphoma two years after renal transplant. Case Description: A 57 year old woman with PMH of ESRD s/p kidney transplant (D/EBV -,R/ EBV +) with chronic CrCl of 30-40% presented with paresthesia and numbness over the right side of her body with mild ataxia 2 years post transplant. Physical exam revealed only numbness over the right side of body. MRI with contrast revealed a left thalamic lesion with moderate vasogenic edema, and MR spectroscopy confirmed high grade neoplasm involving left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy showed polymorphic CD-20 and EBV positive PTLD. EBV PCR were elevated. Further evaluation ruled out systemic PTLD. Myfortic was stopped and oral steroids started with mild improvement in symptoms. Choice of systemic chemotherapy was limited due to reduced CrCl and risks of graft failure. She received modified regimen with renally adjusted high dose Methotrexate, Vincristine and Rituximab for 6 cycles with partial remission and then Temozolomide for 7 cycles with complete remission. Discussion(s): The incidence of PTLD ranges from 1 to 25% with 90% of cases being EBV-associated, CD20 positive, B cell neoplasms. PCNS-PTLD has a higher incidence in renal SOT, occurs late and is usually monomorphic unlike our patient. Median time of occurrence is 4-5 years after transplant. Risk factors include age, intensity of immunosuppression, time to transplant and EBV status of donor and recipient. Common presenting features include neurological deficits, seizure, and raised intracranial pressure. MRI is the preferred imaging and shows multifocal, ill defined, ring enhancing lesions usually in supratentorial and lobar regions. Positive CSF EBV PCR is highly suggestive but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment modalities include reduction of immunosuppression, rituximab, high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and cranial radiotherapy. Use of high dose methotrexate has shown improved outcomes with median survival of 26-47 months. Lack of response to first line therapy is considered the dominant prognostic factor. Early recognition and diagnosis remain crucial for improving outcome."
2073,Excluded,"Space flight and neurovestibular adaptation Space flight represents a form of sensory stimulus rearrangement requiring modification of established terrestrial response patterns through central reinterpretation. Evidence of sensory reinterpretation is manifested as postflight modifications of eye/head coordination, locomotor patterns, postural control strategies, and illusory perceptions of self or surround motion in conjunction with head movements. Under normal preflight conditions, the head is stabilized during locomotion, but immediately postflight reduced head stability, coupled with inappropriate eye/head coordination, results in modifications of gait. Postflight postural control exhibits increased dependence on vision which compensates for inappropriate interpretation of otolith and proprioceptive inputs. Eye movements compensatory for perceived self motion, rather than actual head movements have been observed postflight. Overall, the in-flight adaptive modification of head stabilization strategies, changes in head/eye coordination, illusionary motion, and postural control are maladaptive for a return to the terrestrial environment.

Risk of brain metastases (BM) affects a remarkable number of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, impacting on their quality of life (QoL) and prognosis. While tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed interesting intracranial control rates in oncogene-addicted NSCLC, BM still represent an unmet need for the counterpart without driver gene mutations. For these patients, new treatment options include anti-angiogenic drugs and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, possibly combined with standard chemotherapy, even though the benefit on BM has not been clearly defined. A multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, medical and radiation oncologists is needed in order to integrate systemic and loco-regional strategies at the right time point. Ad-hoc designed clinical trials are slowly emerging for previously treated patients with uncontrolled BM. The aim of this review is to offer a detailed and updated picture of possible approaches for non oncogene-addicted NSCLC patients having BM, in order to support clinicians in their daily practice.

40,Included,"Reduced pineal melatonin biosynthesis in fractionally irradiated rats The effects of ionizing radiation on pineal melatonin and on key enzymes of its metabolism have been studied in our laboratory. After adaptation to an artificial light/dark cycle of 12:12 h, male Wistar rats were fractionally whole-body irradiated with a dose of 2.4 Gy of gamma-rays twice a week up to total doses of 4.8, 9.6 or 14.4 Gy. Irradiation and sham-irradiation were performed in the late afternoon. The rats were sacrificed at 24:00 to 01:00 h in darkness, 6 h, 3 or 5 days after the last exposure. Pineal and serum melatonin concentrations, pineal activities of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and of monoamine oxidase (MAO) were determined. The NAT activities in the rats irradiated with 4.8 and 9.6 Gy decreased at some intervals without changes of melatonin concentration. Irradiation with a total dose of 14.4 Gy decreased NAT activity and the concentration of pineal and serum melatonin 6 h and 3 days after the last exposure. The activity of MAO, estimated only in the rats irradiated with the dose of 14.4 Gy, increased significantly 3 days after irradiation. The fractionated irradiation up to the dose of 14.4 Gy caused a transient decrease in pineal melatonin synthesis. This could be the consequence of preferential oxidative deamination of serotonin in comparison with its N-acetylation, leading to melatonin biosynthesis."
2685,Excluded,"A ciliary opsin in the brain of a marine annelid zooplankton is ultraviolet-sensitive, and the sensitivity is tuned by a single amino acid residue Ciliary opsins were classically thought to function only in vertebrates for vision, but they have also been identified recently in invertebrates for non-visual photoreception. Larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii are used as a zooplankton model, and this zooplankton species possesses a ""vertebrate-type"" ciliary opsin (named c-opsin) in the brain. Platynereis c-opsin is suggested to relay light signals for melatonin production and circadian behaviors. Thus, the spectral and biochemical characteristics of this c-opsin would be directly related to non-visual photoreception in this zooplankton model. Here we demonstrate that the c-opsin can sense UV to activate intracellular signaling cascades and that it can directly bind exogenous all-trans-retinal. These results suggest that this c-opsin regulates circadian signaling in a UV-dependent manner and that it does not require a supply of 11-cis-retinal for photoreception. Avoidance of damaging UV irradiation is a major cause of large-scale daily zooplankton movement, and the observed capability of the c-opsin to transmit UV signals and bind all-trans-retinal is ideally suited for sensing UV radiation in the brain, which presumably lacks enzymes producing 11-cis-retinal. Mutagenesis analyses indicated that a unique amino acid residue (Lys-94) is responsible for c-opsin-mediated UV sensing in the Platynereis brain. We therefore propose that acquisition of the lysine residue in the c-opsin would be a critical event in the evolution of Platynereis to enable detection of ambient UV light. In summary, our findings indicate that the c-opsin possesses spectral and biochemical properties suitable for UV sensing by the zooplankton model."

Participants were randomly assigned to receive SBRT (single-fraction 24 Gy) or 3DCRT (30 Gy/10 fractions). QOL (EORTC QLQ-BM22), fatigue (EORTC QLQ FA13), and emotional distress (QSC-R10) at the end of radiotherapy, along with 3- and 6-month follow-up were assessed.RESULTS: At all recorded time points, there were no significant QOL differences between cohorts, including painful sites, pain characteristics, functional impairment, or psychosocial aspects (p>0.05 for all). There were also no differences in all dimensions of fatigue between groups at each recorded time point (p>0.05 for all). Emotional distress was also similar at three (p=0.248) and six months (p=0.603).CONCLUSION: Although these results demonstrate that SBRT does not cause worse QOL deteriorations compared to 3DCRT, larger randomized investigations are recommended to corroborate these findings."

The surgical patients were also subdivided into two groups and compared. The neuropsychological measures were standardized psychological tests designed to assess aspects of attention, memory and executive function.PATIENTS: The patients were those who had been treated with transfrontal surgery (n = 23), transsphenoidal surgery (n = 23) and medication only (n = 23). The groups did not differ with respect to age, education or premorbid ability level as assessed by the National Adult Reading Test. All participants were free of known sources of cognitive impairment other than pituitary tumour.RESULTS: Comparison of the four groups revealed that nearly half of the transfrontal, one-third of the transsphenoidal and one-quarter of the non-surgical group had three or more neuropsychological tests scores below the 10th percentile compared to less than 5% of the controls. Impairments in memory and executive function were found in both surgical groups. The non-surgical patients appeared to have problems only on tasks requiring high levels of cognitive processing. Differences were found between the two surgical groups with respect to the severity of the cognitive impairment, the transfrontal patients having more severe impairment than the transsphenoidal. No significant negative effects on cognitive functioning were associated with radiotherapy; however, transfrontal surgery patients who had not been treated with radiotherapy were found to be more impaired than other patients. This was thought to be related to radical surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with treated pituitary tumour suffer significant cognitive impairment. The severity and nature of impairment differs between treatment groups, although the cause of this could not be addressed by this study. Recommendations are made for future research and clinical practice."
990,Excluded,"Evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and identification of dying cells in X-ray-induced cell death in the developing brain Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a ""ladder"" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation."
1516,Included,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it."

Results demonstrated that following 60 stimulations of the left basolateral amygdala over a 4-week period, male Long-Evans rats exhibited decrements in every aspect of sexual behavior. Specifically, latencies to mount, intromit and ejaculate were all prolonged following long-term kindling, and ejaculation frequencies were significantly reduced. Furthermore, spontaneous peri-copulatory WDS were increased in kindled rats, suggesting a possible role of the 5-HT2A receptor. However, countering this suggestion, there were no differences between sham and kindled rats on WDS induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI.

153,Included,"Phase measurement of cognitive impairment specific to radiotherapy PURPOSE: Memory impairment is an early-delayed effect of radiotherapy (RT). The prospective longitudinal measurement of the cognitive phase effects from RT was conducted on treated and untreated brain tumor patients. The study design investigated semantic vs. perceptual and visual vs. verbal memory to determine the most disease-specific measure of RT-related changes and understanding of the neurotoxicity from RT to the brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tests of memory that had previously shown RT-related phasic changes were compared with experimental tests of memory to test hypotheses about cognition targeted to the neural toxicity of RT. The results from 41 irradiated and 29 nonirradiated patients with low-grade, supratentorial tumors were analyzed. The methods controlled for comorbid white matter risk, recurrence, interval after treatment, and age (18-69 years). The effects were examined before RT and at three points after RT to 1 year using a mixed effects model that included interval, group, surgical status, medication use, practice, and individual random effects. Four new tests of memory and other candidate cognitive tests were investigated, and a post hoc analysis of a comprehensive battery of tests was performed to identify the cognitive processes most specific to RT.RESULTS: The RT effects on memory were identified in the treated group only; among the new tests of memory and the complete neurocognitive battery, the RT effects were significant only for delayed recall (p < 0.009) and interval to recognize (p < 0.002). Tumor location was not related to the treatment effect. Memory decline was specific to retrieval of semantic memories; a double dissociation of semantic from perceptual visual memory was demonstrated in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate memory dependent on the semantic cortex and the hippocampal memory system. A cognitive measurement that is brief but specific to neural mechanisms is effective and feasible for studies of RT damage."
2415,Included,"Prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen treatment and rat spinal cord re-irradiation Normal tissue injury may lead to severe, life threatening, late side effects after therapeutic use of irradiation. Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue.

1071,Excluded,"Radiotherapy of maxillary cancer using 9 equi-spaced beam coplanar beam arrangement and 9 non-coplanar beam arrangement with beam angle optimization - A dosimetric comparison Background: IMRT is a novel radiotherapy that can deliver high conformal homogeneous dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding tissues and structures. Conventional routine IMRT usually uses equi-spaced beam arrangement of 5 to 9. However, in recent development, manipulating the beam arrangement of IMRT is offered in beam angle optimization (BAO), in which it automatically chooses optimized beam angles in either coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements. In Pugachev et al. (2001) study it has been suggested that improvement of the dose distribution was seen in complicated head and neck cancer cases with BAO. Nevertheless, opposite opinion has been raised by Stein et al. (1997) which stated that the marginal gain by manipulating beam angle diminished when there are more than 7 beams. Notwithstanding the controversy in study results, it was observed that careful selection of beam orientation contributed to a better dose distribution in the final treatment plan in clinical experience. This study is to investigate the dosimetric effect of manipulating beam angles with BAO in maxillary cancer cases compared with 9 equi-spaced beam co-planar arrangement. Method(s): The subjects in this study were recruited from the Princess Margaret Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the period of 1st Jan 2006 to 31st Dec 2010. Planning computed tomography (CT) images of the samples were retrospectively restored. Five samples were recruited using random sampling. It was an experimental study to test the effect of using equispaced beams, BAO and VMAT in IMRT. The parameters for comparison are tumour dose conformity, homogeneity; and the OARs maximum, mean dose. 2 plans were produced for each recruited patients. One using 9 equispaced beam arrangement and the other using 9 non-coplanar field using BAO. Result(s): For the five recruited patients, both 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement and BAO resulted in clinically satisfactory dose distribution and were of similar quality. It was found that IMRT plans with BAO resulted in better OARs sparing, including the parotid, cochlear, eyes, optic nerves, the optic chiasm and brain stem. In terms of target coverage, 4 out of 5 plans produced better in BAO when compared with 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement. Conclusion(s): The effect of the selection of beam angle orientations was significant within the samples. The choice of beam orientations is a factor affecting the dosimetric outcome even when the beam number is equal to 9."
1054,Included,"The effect of age on the latency of radiation myelopathy The latent period to forelimb paresis following photon irradiation of the cervical spinal cord was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats ranging in age from 9 days to adulthood. The radiation was administered dorsally in single fractions, and in 15-day-old animals, to different lengths of the rostral cord and in doses ranging from 16 to 38 Gy. The duration of the latent period was found to be directly proportional to the age of the animal at the time of irradiation, and independent of radiation dose or the volume of the cervical cord which was irradiated. In the majority of paretic animals, the irradiated segment of the spinal cord demonstrated white matter necrosis.

After 3 weeks only a limited number of surviving cells were observed in the specimens, as compared with controls. The in vitro changes in tissue morphology indicate an irreversible course even after irradiation with the lowest dose, 30 Gy single dose. As a comparison with the in vitro experimental material it has also been possible to analyse the light and electron microscopic morphology of a tumour from a patient previously treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. An similar substantial Schwann cell loss was found in the centre of the tumour treated with stereotactic irradiation prior to surgery, as compared with the in vitro material."
1211,Included,"The effect of exposure to 60Co accelerated electrons and gamma quanta on the activity of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes in the rat brain. [Russian] In experiments with 112 male Wistar rats it was shown that accelerated electrons (85 Gy) caused a significant increase in activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDG) by 15.8% and lactate dehydrogenase (LDG) by 17.0%, and a decrease in activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) by 10.6 and 7.8% respectively within the sensorimotor region of the cerebral cortex immediately after irradiation. Activity of SDG and MAO decreased (by 16.4% and 7.8% respectively) in the caudate nucleus over the same period of time. An increase in the accelerated electron dose from 85 to 500 Gy did not change the direction and the rate of the radiation response of the enzymes. Exposure of rats to 60Co gamma quanta (75 Gy) increased SDG and LDG activity (by 21.4 and 17.3% respectively) within the sensorimotor cortex as late as 10 min after irradiation.

2841,Excluded,"Differential expression of KCC2 accounts for the differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb The rat olfactory bulb is anatomically immature at birth, and considerable neurogenesis and synaptogenesis are known to take place postnatally. In addition, significant physiological changes have also been reported in this period. For example, granule cell-mediated inhibition following electrical stimulations to the lateral olfactory tract is robust during the first postnatal week, and then decreases abruptly after the second week. However, the mechanism underlying this enhanced inhibition remains to be elucidated. To know the cause of this phenomenon, we investigated the expression patterns of cation-Cl(-) co-transporters (KCC1, KCC2 and NKCC1) mRNAs, which are responsible for the regulation of [Cl(-)](i). In addition, responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measured by gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings and Ca(2+) imaging using fura-2. We found that in the early postnatal period, mitral cells expressing KCC2 mRNA were inhibited by GABA, while granule cells lacking KCC2 mRNA expression were depolarized or excited by GABA. These results indicate that transient GABA-mediated excitation on granule cells might be the main cause of the enhanced inhibition on mitral cells, and suggest that these differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons play pivotal roles in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb."

[Chinese] Objective: We studied the effect of reirradiation to the vestibular apparatus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 52 reirradiated NPC patients underwent regular follow-up at Tzu Chi Hospital. Nine were diagnosed with vestibular apparatus disorders, based on detailed histories and balance function tests which included an illegible E-test, and refixation saccade test as well as bithermal air caloric and rotary chair tests. The clinical characteristics were analyzed. Result(s): Of 9 patients with vestibular apparatus disorders, seven had bilateral loss of vestibular function, one had vestibular neuronitis and one had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The 7 patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function had bilateral otitis media and moderate to profound bilateral hearing loss. Illegible E-test, refixation saccade test, electronystagmography, bithermal air caloric test and rotary chair test are useful tools for diagnosis. All 9 patients received total radiation dosages over 12,000 cGy.

This study sought to determine the efficacy and safety of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) for thyroid cancer patients. Method(s): Thyroid cancer patients with spine metastases were selected and analyzed from a cohort of patients who were prospectively enrolled in two single-institution Phase I/II studies. SSRS was delivered in single or multi-fraction schedules. Dose regimens ranged from 16-18 Gy in one fraction to 27-30 Gy in three to five fractions. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI-CTC toxicity scale. Local control was determined by serial post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans showing no evidence of progressive disease. Patients were followed until date of death or date of last known visit for survival analyses. Local control and overall survival rates were carried out using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The log-rank test was used to assess the equality of the survivor function across groups. A p-value of <=0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 27 spine lesions were treated in 23 patients over a six-year period. Median follow-up was 28.9 months (range 5-93 months). Local control was 88% at two years and 79% at three years. In patients with progressive disease following conventional radiation therapy, local control for salvage SSRS remained at 88% at three years. Patients requiring upfront surgical intervention and treated with adjuvant SSRS achieved sustained control rates of 86% at three years. Overall survival rates were 85% and 67% at one and two years, respectively. In patients classified with oligoprogression and controlled extra-spinal disease, overall survival was significantly higher than those with evidence of systemic progression (81% vs. 45% at two years; p = 0.01). Univariate analysis did not show significant correlations between local control and age, systemic disease status, prior <sup>131</sup>I therapy, SSRS fraction regimen, spine location, histological subtype, or time from initial diagnosis to evidence of spinal metastasis. No patient experienced any grade 3-5 toxicity. Pain flare was reported in 30% of patients, with only three patients (13%) requiring narcotics or short-course steroids. There was no evidence of vertebral body fracture in any patient that achieved local control in the treated area. Conclusion(s): SSRS for thyroid metastases as a primary or adjuvant/salvage therapy is well tolerated and yields high rates of local control. Â© Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016."

Among all lung tumors, small cell lung cancers account for about 20%. Patients typically include heavy smokers in 70s age group, presenting with symptoms such as intrathoracic tumors growth, distant spread or paraneoplastic syndromes at the time of diagnosis. A useful and functional classification divides small cell lung cancers into limited disease and extensive disease. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment for limited disease, with improved survival when combined with prophylactic cranial irradiation. Platinum compounds (cisplatin/carboplatin) plus etoposide remain the cornerstone for extensive disease. Nevertheless, despite high chemoand radio-sensitivity of this cancer, nearly all patients relapse within the first two years and the prognosis is extremely poor. A deeper understanding about small cell lung cancer carcinogenesis led to develop and test a considerable number of new and targeted agents but the results are currently weak or insufficient. To date, small cell lung cancer is still a challenge for researchers.

In this study, we evaluated spine surgeons' knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery.METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including questions about surgeons' characteristics and knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery. A survey was performed with the members of AOSpine Latin America. The main variables studied were specialty, years of experience, surgeon's position during fluoroscopy, and practices to reduce the patient's and surgeon's radiation exposure during surgery. The results were analyzed and compared among different specialties, levels of experience, and countries of origin.RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 371 members of AOSpine Latin America from different countries. The sample was mostly from orthopedic surgeons (57.1%) and surgeons in practice for longer than 10 years (54.2%). Thyroid lead protection was used by 64.2% of the spine surgeons, lead glasses by 20.2%, and lead gloves by 7%. A dosimeter badge was never or only rarely used by 75.7%. The correct answer for surgeon position during lateral lumbar fluoroscopy was reported by only one-third of the surgeons. The reported rate of thyroid protector use was higher in surgeons from Brazil and Colombia compared with surgeons from Mexico and Argentina (P < 0.001), whereas the use of pulsed-mode fluoroscopy was higher in Mexico and Argentina compared with Brazil and Colombia (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts toward implementing educational programs in Latin America focused on safety strategies are needed to minimize intraoperative radiation exposure."

More than 100 patients with glioma, radiation necrosis, Alzheimer disease, or epilepsy have been studied with this system. Approximately 1 million events are acquired in 15 minutes, starting 1 hour after injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose. Normal structures as small as the superior colliculi and the external capsule have been resolved. Improved separation of the cortical ribbon from adjacent white matter has allowed more accurate determination of cortical metabolic rate. In two of 15 patients undergoing evaluation for recurrent glioma, the PET 600 images showed tumor uptake that was not apparent on a lower-resolution study. A high-activity orbiting transmission source with electronic collimation allows accurate, short-duration transmission measurements to be made after radiopharmaceutical administration. The anatomic detail seen on the transmission images can be used for reproducible patient positioning with an accuracy of 1-2 mm perpendicular to the image plane.

To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Method(s): Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Result(s): Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusion(s): A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood.

Limnological parameters revealed no significant changes throughout the period of experimentation which were measured by PCS Testr 35 Multi-Parameter. Morphometric analysis revealed that during the extended exposure period of 10 days the spawn size and weight were reduced as analysed through Specific Growth Rate (SGR). SGR values in terms of weight for 5 and 10 days under 3 time-frames were 17.12%, 12.52%, 11.46% and 9.09%, 6.43%, 6.09% respectively, which revealed a declined trend along with the exposure days. In the skin of C. batrachus, the compact regular orientation of the stratified epithelial cells and mucous cells became distorted and the microridges and double-ridged structures showed destruction and fragmentations. The body striations and microfolds became shrinked and swollen and finally degenerated to form a mass. The distribution of mucous cells throughout the epidermis was disorganised and releasing secretory contents on the surface through small pores. Appearance of huge quantity of biogenic semi-hexagonal plate like crystals (guanine platelets) on the skin surface of the body was the most significant observations during UV-B radiation. In the developmental phases the eyeball showed shrinkage loosing normal regular concave structure and to become a dome-shaped one. The supportive connective infoldings became loosened. The choroid coat displayed deformities and the iris deformed the pupil. The fibroblast on the epithelium and melanocytes depicted dispersed arrangement. The pairs of ventral barbels near the mouth depicted the presence of taste buds that became severely damaged exposing the sensory as well as neuroepithelial cells. Compact regular arrangement of the SECs was completely destroyed leaving long and deep channels inbetween them; the disintegrated concentric MRs also showed a mass."
915,Excluded,"Quantitative assessment of cerebral hemodynamics using perfusion-weighted MRI in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease: comparison with positron emission tomography BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to acetazolamide is a key parameter in determining the severity of hemodynamic impairment in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease. Perfusion-weighted MRI (PW MRI) can measure the cerebral blood volume (CBV) as an indicator of hemodynamic impairment. CBV measured by PW MRI was compared with CVR measured by positron emission tomography (PET).METHODS: Twelve normal subjects and 17 patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease underwent PW MRI and PET. The images were coregistered with 3-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition images. Quantitative PW MRI-CBV maps were generated using the indicator dilution method with arterial input function. One large cortical region of interest for each unilateral middle cerebral artery territory was determined on each image. PET-CVR was calculated by measuring cerebral blood flow before and after acetazolamide challenge.RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was observed between PW MRI-CBV and PET-CVR (r=-0.713; P<0.0001). PW MRI-CBV higher than the mean +2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.2 mL/100 g) was defined as elevated and PET-CVR lower than the mean -2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.1%) was defined as reduced. Assuming the PET-CVR as the true determinant of hemodynamic impairment, PW MRI-CBV provided 80.0% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with 80.0% positive predictive value for detecting patients with reduced CVR.CONCLUSIONS: The PW MRI-CBV method can simply and accurately identify patients with hemodynamic impairment without exposure to ionizing radiation."
429,Excluded,"ADC texture--an imaging biomarker for high-grade glioma? PURPOSE: Survival for high-grade gliomas is poor, at least partly explained by intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to treatment resistance. Radiological evaluation of treatment response is in most cases limited to assessment of tumor size months after the initiation of therapy. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been widely investigated, as it reflects tumor cellularity and proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate texture analysis of ADC images in conjunction with multivariate image analysis as a means for identification of pretreatment imaging biomarkers.METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive high-grade glioma patients were treated with radiotherapy (2 Gy/60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. ADC maps and T1-weighted anatomical images with and without contrast enhancement were collected prior to treatment, and (residual) tumor contrast enhancement was delineated. A gray-level co-occurrence matrix analysis was performed on the ADC maps in a cuboid encapsulating the tumor in coronal, sagittal, and transversal planes, giving a total of 60 textural descriptors for each tumor. In addition, similar examinations and analyses were performed at day 1, week 2, and week 6 into treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality of the data, and the five largest components (scores) were used in subsequent analyses. MRI assessment three months after completion of radiochemotherapy was used for classifying tumor progression or regression.RESULTS: The score scatter plots revealed that the first, third, and fifth components of the pretreatment examinations exhibited a pattern that strongly correlated to survival. Two groups could be identified: one with a median survival after diagnosis of 1099 days and one with 345 days, p = 0.0001.CONCLUSIONS: By combining PCA and texture analysis, ADC texture characteristics were identified, which seems to hold pretreatment prognostic information, independent of known prognostic factors such as age, stage, and surgical procedure.

982,Included,"p53 tumor suppressor protein regulates the levels of huntingtin gene expression The p53 protein is a transcription factor that integrates various cellular stress signals. The accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract plays a central role in the pathology of human Huntington's disease. We found that the huntingtin gene contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and p53 binds to these elements both in vivo and in vitro. p53 activation in cultured human cells, either by a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein or by gamma-irradiation (gamma-irradiation), increases huntingtin mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, murine huntingtin also contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and its expression is induced by p53 activation in cultured cells. Moreover, gamma-irradiation, which activates p53, increases huntingtin gene expression in the striatum and cortex of mouse brain, the major pathological sites for Huntington's disease, in p53+/+ but not the isogenic p53-/- mice. These results demonstrate that p53 protein can regulate huntingtin expression at transcriptional level, and suggest that a p53 stress response could be a modulator of the process of Huntington's disease."

This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters. Thus, radioresistant DNA synthesis in chromosomal instability syndromes may be explained by some defect in DNA replication in unirradiated cells analogous to that in irradiated normal cells."

Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify astrogliosis post-RT and immunofluorescence was used to visualize protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 post-RT. Recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to elucidate the role of TNF in leukocyte adhesion and vessel diameter.RESULTS: Mice treated with anti-TNF showed significantly lower permeability and leukocyte adhesion at 24 and 48 h post-RT vs. RT-only animals. We observed a significant decrease in arteriole diameters at 48 h post-RT that was inhibited in TNF-treated animals. We also saw a significant increase in activated astrocytes following RT that was significantly lower in the anti-TNF-treated group. In addition, immunofluorescence showed protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 in the cerebral cortex that was inhibited with anti-TNF treatment. Finally, administration of rTNF induced a decrease in arteriole diameter and a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in venules and arterioles.CONCLUSIONS: TNF plays a significant role in acute changes in BBB permeability, leukocyte adhesion, arteriole diameter, and astrocyte activation following cranial radiation.

We assessed the validity of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to detect changes in ICP.METHODS: Subjects were eight patients undergoing medically necessary diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion testing for hydrocephalus. DPOAE measurements were obtained with an FDA-approved system at baseline and six controlled ICP levels in ~3 mmHg increments in random order, with a range from 10.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg (SD) at baseline to 32.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg (SD) at level 6.RESULTS: For f2 frequencies between 800 and 1700 Hz, when ICP was >= 12 mmHg above baseline ICP, DPOAE angles increased significantly and DPOAE magnitudes decreased significantly, but less robustly.DISCUSSION: Significant changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude are seen when ICP is >= 12 mmHg above a subject's supine baseline ICP during CSF infusion testing. These results suggest that the changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude seen with change in ICP are physiologically based, and suggest that it should be possible to detect pathological ICP elevation using DPOAE measurements. To use DPOAE for noninvasive estimation of ICP during spaceflight will require baseline measurements in the head-up, supine, and head-down positions to obtain baseline DPOAE values at different ICP ranges.

462,Excluded,"Beneficial outcomes after PCV plus RT in oligodendroglial tumors are associated with detection or risk of an IDH mutation BACKGROUND: Oligodendroglial tumors harbor IDH mutations and risk of this type of cancer is associated with a germ-line polymorphism at 8q. In addition, when these tumors harbor a co-deletion of 1p19q, they can be highly chemo-sensitive. Indeed, patients with anaplastic tumors (i.e., AO/AOA) with 1p19q co-deletion lived nearly twice as long after chemotherapy and radiation (CRT; 14-16 years) as radiotherapy alone (RT; 7-9 years) in two large randomized trials. In RTOG 9402, some patients with non-co-deleted AO/ AOA also lived longer after CRT: for these participants, the survival curves separated after the median had been reached, and significantly more lived 10 years or longer after CRT than RT (25% vs. 10%). Since co-deletion status did not identify all patients benefiting from CRT, we asked whether other molecular hallmarks of AO/AOA - IDH or G-allele status - might be more inclusive markers of benefit from CRT. METHOD(S): We used tissues and data from RTOG 9402 to explore this hypothesis. RESULT(S): IDH status was evaluable in 210 of 291 participants: 156 (74%) had a mutation of IDH1/2. The Gallele of rs55705857 was evaluable in 245 of 291 participants: 76 (31%) carried the risk-allele in their germ-line. Presence of either an IDH mutation or the G risk-allele was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival after CRT, and an IDH mutation with much longer overall survival [9.4 vs. 5.7 years, hazard ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.40, 0.86), P = 0.006]. For cases in which IDH was intact, CRT did not prolong median survival time [1.3 vs. 1.8 years, HR 1.14, CI (0.63, 2.04), P = 0.67] or 10-year survival rates (CRT 6% vs. RT 4%). As expected, patients with mutated, co-deleted AO/AOA lived longer after CRT than RT (14.7 vs. 6.8 years, HR 0.49, CI (0.28, 0.85), P = 0.01], but so too did those with mutated, non-co-deleted AO/AOA [5.5 vs. 3.3 years, HR 0.56, CI (0.32, 0.99), P < 0.05]. Among the latter, ATRX positive and negative cases had longer overall survival after CRT than RT, but these differences were not significant. CONCLUSION(S): In AO/AOA cases in RTOG9402, the presence or risk of an IDH mutation was associated with 'benefit' from CRT. Wild-type IDH was associated with poor overall and long-term survival, and absence of benefit from CRT. IDH mutation status identified more patients who benefited from CRT than did 1p/19q co-deletion status, but patients with co-deleted AO/AOA lived much longer."

An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore, appears to be responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of human alpha-synuclein. Here we describe crystals of NACore that have dimensions smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus are invisible by optical microscopy. As the crystals are thousands of times too small for structure determination by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we use micro-electron diffraction to determine the structure at atomic resolution. The 1.4 A resolution structure demonstrates that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures and here yields, to our knowledge, the highest resolution achieved by any cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure exhibits protofibrils built of pairs of face-to-face beta-sheets. X-ray fibre diffraction patterns show the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length alpha-synuclein. The NACore structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length alpha-synuclein fibril, presenting opportunities for the design of inhibitors of alpha-synuclein fibrils."

Therefore, the authors evaluated the long term efficacy and toxicity of treatment with radiotherapy and concurrent carboplatin plus teniposide followed by three cycles of carmustine in patients who underwent resection for glioblastoma.METHODS: Fifty-six newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma underwent radiotherapy (1.8-2 gray [Gy]/day, 5 days a week using limited fields up to 60 Gy), and concurrent chemotherapy with carboplatin (350 mg/m2) on Days 1, 22, and 43, and teniposide (50 mg/m2) on Days 1, 2, 3, 22, 23, 24, 43, 44, and 45. Four weeks after the end of radiotherapy, patients were given carmustine (200 mg/m2) every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. Treatment then was suspended, but if disease progression was found, treatment was resumed using different drugs.RESULTS: All 56 patients were evaluated for time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST). The TTP was 7.5 months and the MST was 12.5 months. Toxicity manifested as thrombocytopenia and in most cases was acceptable. Four patients (7.1%) had radiation necrosis at 2, 2, 7, and 9 months, respectively, from the end of radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the current study with concurrent radiochemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma are comparable to the best results reported using radiotherapy alone followed by chemotherapy with nitrosoureas."
1230,Excluded,"Precision dosimetry for narrow photon beams used in radiosurgery-determination of Gamma Knife output factors Treatment units for radiosurgery, like Leksell Gamma Knife and adapted, or dedicated, linear accelerators use small circular beams of ionizing radiation down to 4 mm in diameter at the isocenter. By cross-firing, these beams generate a high dose region at the isocenter together with steep dose gradients of up to 30% per mm. These units are used to treat small complex shaped lesions, often located close to critical structures within the brain, by superimposing several single high dose regions. In order to commission such treatment units for stereotactic irradiations, to carry out quality assurance and to simulate treatment conditions, as well as to collect input data for treatment planning, a precise dosimetric system is necessary. Commercially available radiation dosimeters only partially meet the requirements for narrow photon beams and small field sizes as used in stereotactic treatment modalities. The aim of this study was the experimental determination of the output factors for the field defining collimators used in Gamma Knife radiosurgery, in particular for the smallest, the 4 mm collimator helmet. For output factor measurements a pin point air ionization chamber, a liquid ionization chamber, a diode detector, a diamond detector, TLD microcubes and microrods, alanine pellets, and radiochromic films were used. In total, more than 1000 measurements were performed with these different detection systems, at the sites in Munich and Zurich. Our results show a resultant output factor for the 4 mm collimator helmet of 0.8741 +/- 0.0202, which is in good agreement with recently published results and demonstrates the feasibility of such measurements. The measured output factors for the 8 mm and 14 mm collimator helmets are 0.9578 +/- 0.0057 and 0.9870 +/- 0.0086, respectively."
2118,Excluded,"Radiation therapy for melanoma: Adjuvant, palliative and abscopal effects Radiation therapy (RT) has long played a role in the management of melanoma, however historically its efficacy has been questioned due to the perceived radioresistance of melanoma cells in vitro. Apart from proton therapy for choroidal melanoma, RT has limited accepted indications as a definitive treatment. Surgery remains the first line therapy of choice for operable patients and adjuvant RT can be considered for high-risk primary tumours. Prospective randomised data are awaited following a Phase II TROG study reporting high local control rates (93%) following postoperative nodal irradiation in selected patients with node-positive melanoma. High response rates of melanoma (e.g. mucosal or inoperable) to primary radiotherapy have also been reported. Local radiation can achieve tumour-antigen release and clinical results suggest biological interaction with immunomodulating agents (a checkpoint inhibitor and anti-CTLA4 antibody), corroborated by preclinical data. Much interest also lies in enhancing melanoma radiation response rates through combination with clinical hyperthermia, which can achieve radiosensitisation, at least in part, by immune modulation. Novel developments in radiotherapy include the rise in radiosurgical treatment (SRS), involving high dose, small volume irradiation. SRS is increasingly the palliation of choice for patients with two or more brain metastases, following resection of a single brain metastasis and for extra-cranial oligometastases. The results of a Phase III trial evaluating whole brain radiotherapy are awaited. The radiobiological consequences of SRS may be even more immunomodulatory, congruent with retrospective data that fraction sizes greater than 4 Gray are more effective and SRS alone has been suggested to induce an abscopal effect. To date there are limited data reporting SRS with concomitant immunomodulators and the optimal combinations remain to be defined. Serious toxicities have been reported following administration of B-RAF inhibitors with and subsequent to both SRS and fractionated RT. Combination strategies are being actively researched as these should increase the effectiveness of radiation in the management of patients with melanoma by widening the therapeutic window between normal tissue toxicity and melanoma cell kill, and by potentially inducing an out-offield abscopal effect."
45,Excluded,"Clinical outcomes of melanoma brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy BACKGROUND: The anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy nivolumab has significant clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, little is known about the safety and outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy and stereotactic radiation for the treatment of brain metastases (BMs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed retrospectively from two prospective nivolumab protocols enrolling 160 patients with advanced resected and unresectable melanoma at a single institution. Patients were included if BMs were diagnosed and treated with stereotactic radiation within 6 months of receiving nivolumab. The primary end point of this study was neurotoxicity; secondary end points included BM control and survival.RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with a total of 73 BMs treated over 30 sessions were identified. Radiation was administered before, during and after nivolumab in 33 lesions (45%), 5 lesions (7%), and 35 lesions (48%), respectively. All BMs were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in a single session except 12 BMs treated with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, nine of which were in the postoperative setting. One patient experienced grade 2 headaches following SRS with symptomatic relief with steroid treatment. No other treatment-related neurologic toxicities or scalp reactions were reported. Eight (11%) local BM failures with a >=20% increase in volume were noted. Of these lesions, hemorrhage was noted in 4, and edema was noted in 7. Kaplan-Meier estimates for local BM control following radiation at 6 and 12 months were 91% and 85%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) from the date of stereotactic radiation and nivolumab initiation was 11.8 and 12.0 months, respectively, in patients receiving nivolumab for unresected disease (median OS was not reached in patients treated in the resected setting).CONCLUSIONS: In our series, stereotactic radiation to melanoma BMs is well tolerated in patients who received nivolumab. BM control and OS appear prolonged compared with standard current treatment. Prospective evaluation is warranted."

However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control. METHODS Patients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up. RESULTS Seizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief. Copyright Â© AANS 2019"
1513,Included,"Regulation of prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> synthesis after brain irradiation Purpose: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.

A globus pallidus lesion reduced the resting tone and greatly increased rigidity in the contralateral leg. Lesions in the entopeduncular, subthalamic, and accumbens nuclei had no effects on rigidity, although the entopeduncular nucleus lesion reduced resting limb tone. The role of the globus pallidus in rigidity is significant in relation to work in which striatal lesions abolished tremorine-induced rigidity. Some brain regions that receive basal ganglia efferent fibers received a lesion unilaterally. Lesions in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, or pedunculopontine nucleus had no effect on tremorine-induced rigidity. A habenular lesion significantly reduced rigidity in both hind legs. Very pronounced reductions in rigidity occurred after midbrain lesions involving the central periaqueductal grey region and the superior colliculus. The basal ganglia output pathways that may mediate tremorine rigidity are discussed, together with the possibility that the superior colliculus, which has many muscarinic receptors, may be influenced directly by tremorine."

As there is no typical cell line for human thymoma, the development and use of molecular-based therapy for thymoma will require detailed molecular genetic analysis of patients' tissues. The recent reports showed that the gain of chromosome 1q regions was frequent in thymoma. We investigated the use of oligonucleotide arrays to monitor in vivo gene expression levels at chromosome 1q regions in the early- (stage I or II) and late-stage (stage IVa) thymoma tissues from patients. These in vivo gene expression profiles were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using LightCycler for 36 thymoma patients. Using both the methods, candidate genes were come up. These are Arg tyrosine kinase and death-associated protein 3 (DAP3), which are known as ionizing radiation resistance conferring proteins. The Arg/GAPDH mRNA level in stage IV thymoma (90.716 +/- 177.851) was significantly higher than in stage I thymoma (10.335 +/- 25.744, P = 0.0465).

1326,Excluded,"Significant reduction of beta-amyloid in the CNS following external radiation: Implications for treatment in alzheimer's disease Purpose/Objective(s): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly population, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau protein tangles. These events are especially prevalent in the hippocampus region which is responsible for long term memory. In this animal study, we investigated if cranial X-irradiation could reduce the formation of Ab plaques as a potential novel clinical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the rationale being that external beam radiotherapy has been used previously as an effective clinical treatment for systemic amyloidosis. Materials/Methods: A transgenic mouse model was used that expresses a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with early-onset AD. Radiation treatments were either a single dose (5 Gy, 10 Gy or 15 Gy) or daily fractionation (1 Gy, 2 Gy) to a dose of 10 Gy to a single side of the head. Brains were harvested at various times post-irradiation (2-8 wks) and coronal sections were evaluated for H&E and antibody specific immunohistochemistry to detect beta-amyloid plaques and assess radiation response, staining for IL1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, microglia cells (CD11b) and activated microglia cells (CD68). Result(s): Radiation treatments were well-tolerated. H&E stained tissue sections indicated no evidence of a significant decrease in cell density (Nissl staining) and no compelling evidence of significant cellular necrosis. No signs of devitalization, malacia or spongiosus or classic acute or chronic inflammatory features were evident. The number and size of beta-amyloid plaques were compared between the irradiated and shielded halves of the brain. The average number of plaques in the unirradiated brain increased with age, the values for 32, 34 and 38 week old animals were 43.9 (SD +/- 17.6; n = 9), 61.7 (SD +/- 19.8, n = 9) and 109 (SD +/- 26.9, n = 9) respectively. Radiation treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of plaques throughout the brain (paired t-test p = 0.002).This effect was more significant in the hippocampus region (p = 0.0004). At 4 weeks post-treatment 5, 10 and 15 Gy caused a 71 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 24%, 92 +/- 34% reduction in plaque incidence in the hippocampus. The greatest reductions were noted at longer times post-treatment. TGF-beta staining was restricted to the irradiated side of the brain, little or no site-specific staining of IL1 or TNF-alpha was seen. A trend was evident of activated microglia in the irradiated brain. Conclusion(s): We report the first experience that external beam irradiation can produce a significant reduction in beta-amyloid plaques associated with AD."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the release of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) and its effects on sensory neuropeptide release in vitro and acute neurogenic ear swelling in vivo. Capsaicin (10(-6) M) or electrical field stimulation (EFS; 40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s; 1200 impulses)-induced release of PACAP-38, SP, CGRP and somatostatin from isolated rat tracheae was measured with radioimmunoassay. Mustard oil-induced neurogenic inflammation in the mouse ear was determined with a micrometer and in the rat hind paw skin by the Evans Blue leakage technique. Capsaicin and EFS evoked 27% and more than twofold elevation of PACAP-38 release respectively, compared with the prestimulated basal values from isolated trachea preparation. Exogenously administered PACAP-38 (20-2000 nM) diminished both capsaicin- and EFS-evoked sensory neuropeptide release in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal inhibitory effects of PACAP on capsaicin-induced substance P, CGRP and somatostatin release amounted to 75.4%, 73.3% and 90.0%, while EFS-evoked release of these peptides was 80.03%, 87.7% and 67.7%. In case of capsaicin stimulation the EC50 values for substance P, CGRP and somatostatin were 82.9 nM, 60.1 nM and 66.9 nM, respectively. When EFS was performed, these corresponding EC50 data were 92.1 nM, 67.8 nM and 20.9 nM. PACAP-38 (10, 100 and 1000 microg/kg i.p. in 200 microl volume) inhibited neurogenic ear swelling in the mouse. Furthermore, 100 microg/kg i.p. PACAP also significantly diminished mustard oil-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the rat skin. These results suggest that PACAP-38 is released from the stimulated peripheral terminals of capsaicin-sensitive afferents and it is able to inhibit the outflow of sensory neuropeptides. Based on this mechanism of action PACAP is also able to effectively diminish/abolish neurogenic inflammatory response in vivo after systemic administration."

These phosphorylated forms are not only important because of their abundance in aging lenses and the implications for cataract but also because they have been identified in patients with degenerative brain disease. By using mimics corresponding to the reported in vivo phosphorylation sites in the human lens, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation upon the chaperone-like properties and structure of alphaB-crystallin. Here we show that phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at Ser-45 results in uncontrolled aggregation. By using an innovative tandem mass spectrometry approach, we demonstrate how this alteration in behavior stems from disruption of dimeric substructure within the polydisperse alphaB-crystallin assembly. This structural perturbation appears to disturb the housekeeping role of alphaB-crystallin and consequently has important implications for the disease states caused by protein aggregation in the lens and deposition in non-lenticular tissue."

In particular, little is known about the lasting effects of GCR on the central nervous system (CNS), which may lead to behavior performance deficits. Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses.

In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior.

2067,Excluded,"A novel specific application of pyruvate protects the mouse retina against white light damage: differential stabilization of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha PURPOSE: To mimic hypoxia preconditioning by a novel specific pyruvate treatment and to study its retinal protection against white light damage.METHODS: Six-to-eight-week-old BALB/c mice were exposed to strong white light calculated to produce photoreceptor degeneration. Some were given injections of pyruvate in a preordained protocol because evidence exists that proves pyruvate can affect the concentration of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of proteins and mRNAs in retinas. Morphology was analyzed with toluidine blue staining and was plotted using a spidergraph. A free nucleosome cell death assay was used to examine apoptosis. Retina explant cultures were used to investigate the background mechanism.RESULTS: Pyruvate administration stabilized hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. Expression of the downstream genes hemoxygenase-1 and erythropoietin mirrored the changes of the two HIFs, respectively. Importantly, pyruvate given not only before but also after exposure to light protected photoreceptors against apoptosis. In the retinal explant system, addition or depletion of pyruvate caused only changes of HIF-1alpha and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)-2, while HIF-2alpha and PHD1 were not affected. However, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-2alpha was stabilized by pyruvate but not HIF-1alpha.CONCLUSIONS: Pyruvate evoked a hypoxia-like response under normoxic conditions and was retina-protective against strong white light. This response included stabilization of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. This differential stabilization might be related to the distinct preference of their degrading enzyme of PHD2 and PHD1 in response to pyruvate treatment."

This article summarizes the major issues surrounding the management of brain metastases, and also analyzes 21 independent reports of Gamma Knife- or linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, representing over 1,700 patients and more than 2,700 lesions. Variable reporting in the studies precludes a definitive, rigorous analysis, but the composite data reveal an average local control rate of 83% and median survival of 9.6 months, both of which are comparable to results in recent surgical reports. The most important prognostic factors for survival appear to be fewer than three lesions, controlled extracranial disease, and Karnofsky performance score (KPS). The exact impact of dose has not been clarified, but a dose-response relationship, especially for > or = 18 Gy, is emerging. The role of whole-brain radiotherapy remains unresolved. It may enhance local control but does not convincingly improve survival and, in some series, is associated with an increased risk of late complications. Chronic steroid dependence and increased intracranial edema do not appear to be common problems. This is an opportune time for the completion of ongoing randomized trials to validate these observations. [References: 46]"

BACKGROUND: There is ongoing debate about whether a computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) should be aborted when the calcium score (CS) exceeds a certain threshold in patients with chest pain. The aim of this study was to discover whether specific ""cutpoints"" regarding coronary artery CS could be determined to predict severe coronary stenoses assessed by CTCA, thus identifying patients amenable to an invasive diagnostic approach.METHODS: 294 consecutive patients with chest pain of uncertain cause who were referred for non-invasive diagnostic CTCA were included. Subjects underwent Agatston CS and CTCA using current 64-slice technology.RESULTS: Severe coronary stenoses were noted in 75 of 294 (25.1%) patients on CTCA. A very high prevalence of severe coronary stenoses was found in patients with CS >= 400 (87.0%). The CS had area under the ROC curve 0.86 to predict severe coronary stenoses on CTCA. The best discriminant cut-off point was CS >= 400 (sensitivity of 55.3%, specificity of 93.5, positive predictive value of 85.8%, negative predictive value of 84.0%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for traditional risk factors showed CS >= 400 remained an independent predictor of severe coronary stenoses on CTCA (OR 14.553, 95% confidence interval 4.043 to 52.384, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: CS can be used as a ""gatekeeper"" to CTCA in patients with chest pain. Due to the very high prevalence of severe coronary stenoses in patients with CS >= 400, further evaluation with CTCA is not warranted as these patients should be referred to invasive coronary angiography, avoiding the repeated exposure to ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast."

Special Session Intraprocedural radiation dose management 103.1 Occupational dosimetry in the interventional laboratory: dose limits and risk estimation G. Bartal Radiology, Meir MC, Kfar-Saba, Israel Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the potential risks of occupational radiation exposure 2. To learn about the dose limits for different organs and acceptable dose 3. To learn how to estimate the risks As more evidence is emerging from recent publications on the dangers of occupational radiation exposure in Image (Fluoroscopy) guided interventions there is a clear need to recognize the risks, to learn about staff dose limits and the ways to reduce the possible damage to a Minimum. Recent publications confirm the alarming incidence and variety of occupational-related illnesses of medical staff working in the interventional laboratory (1, 2, 3). International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) issued a new recommendation for the occupational dose limit to the lens of the eye based on the new threshold for lens effects and the suggested equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye was reduced from 150mSv year-1 (ICRP 2013 Proceedings) to 20mSv year-1, averaged over a 5-year period, with no year's dose exceeding 50mSv (ICRP, 2012). Last International and European BSS (Basic Safety Standards) comprises new limit (European Commission, 2012; IAEA, 2014) for the medical staff (1). Relatively high exposure doses have been reported for both extremities (2) and the eye lens (3, 4) of the Interventional Radiologists (IRs) that in some cases, exceed the personal dose limits. Moreover, new controlled data suggest lower or even no dose threshold for radiation- induced eye lens injuries. These data are under consideration by the ICRP and may lead to the re-evaluation of the existing dose limit (1). There is no ""acceptable dose"" definition or recommendation for the personnel, as it depends on the specific applications and is different for public, workers and patients. There are dose limits for the personnel, which are not applicable to the medical exposure of patients. Noticeably, new dose thresholds, particularly the 0.5 Gy threshold for the lens of the eye, affect occupational protection for operators and other staff, which is principally important for fluoroscopically guided procedures (1, 6). Regrettably, not all operators protect their eyes or their brain sufficiently during interventions. After several years of work without proper protection, cumulative absorbed doses to the lens can exceed 0.5 Gy [ RELID (Retrospective Evaluation of Lens Injuries and Dose) (see: https://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/ news/relid-cataract-study.htm)]. During most of the IAEA surveys of radiation-related lens opacities in interventionalists and staff, 40-50% of the professionals involved in interventional cardiology procedures who volunteered to be examined had posterior subcapsular lens opacities (2, 3, 4). Only 10% of the members of the control groups had such opacities. Important to note that most of the observed lens opacities were in interventionists who had worked for several years without any eye protection. The dose rate to the operator can exceed 10 mSv h-1 when the 'high-dose' fluoroscopy mode is used and 50 mSv h-1 during cine acquisition. The highest dose rate was recorded at the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO 90) projection, which corresponds to the lateral projection when the operator is standing at the tube side (4, 5). Many medical specialties outside the imaging departments (e.g. vascular surgery, urology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, anaesthetics and pain management) are starting to use or increase their use of fluoroscopically guided procedures in surgical theatres without the radiation protection tools available in standard interventional laboratories (ICRP, 2010). Such a practice may result in occupational doses or these physicians that are higher than the typical values recorded in interventional radiology and cardiology services, where protection tools are used regularly (6). Lack of compliance with the regular use of personal dosimetry has been a problem for many years in many countries (5, 7). This is one of the reasons for the shortage of an accurate occupational dose data (and reliable radiation risk estimations) in different professional groups. One of the methods of estimating staff doses is working on Monte Carlo calculations and detection of staff location in the catheterisation laboratory to calculate approximately staff doses during clinical procedures through the use of radiographic and geometric data. Another method that was recently published is use of a realistic approach to estimate lens doses in interventional cardiology when personal dosimeters are not used regularly. The authors concluded that for around 2000 diagnostic, PCI, and valvular procedures, when the median scatter dose value per procedure at the C-arm was 0.78, 1.07, and 1.45 mSv, respectively (4). Lens doses are approximately 50-60% of these values when radiation protection tools are not used. For all of these procedures, the ratio between the scatter dose at the C-arm and the kerma-area product was 10.3-11.3 mSv(Gy cm2)-1 (6). Several medical societies including CIRSE and SIR have published or endorsed documents on occupational protection that are also expected to improve staff radiation safety (7). New ethical issues are emerging in situations where reducing patient dose involves increasing staff doses and vice versa. Occupational radiological protection is still a challenge in several clinical situations. ICRP has included specific recommendations and advice for occupational protection in most of its publications in recent years (ICRP, 2000, 2007 a,b,c, 2009, 2010, 2013 a,b). Operator dose (incident air kerma) at the typical working position is around 1/1000 of incident air kerma at the patient's skin, so the instantaneous dose rate to an unprotected operator may reach approximately 5mGymin-1. Newer active personal dosimeters display occupational dose rates in real time inside the interventional fluoroscopy suite, and allow subsequent detailed analyses of staff and patient doses by recording dose at very short intervals. This data on implementation of the real time active personnel dosimetry permit the development of new optimisation strategies to improve occupational protection (7, 9)."

Specifically, we assessed the absorbed dose and the rate of adverse effects for several organs at risk (OAR), including the hippocampus, according to the tilt of a patient's head. We arbitrarily selected five cases where measurements were made with the patients' heads tilted forward and five cases without such tilt. We set the entire brain as the planning target volume (PTV), and the hippocampi, the lenses, the eyes, and the cochleae as the main OAR, and formulated new plans for IMRT (coplanar, non-coplanar) and VMAT (coplanar, non-coplanar). Using the dose-volume histogram (DVH), we calculated and compared the effective uniform dose (EUD), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of the OAR and the mean and the maximum doses of hippocampus. As a result, if the patient tilted the head forward when receiving the Linac-based treatment, for the same treatment effect in the PTV, we confirmed that a lower dose entered the OAR, such as the hippocampus, eye, lens, and cochlea. Moreover, the damage to the hippocampus was expected to be the least when receiving coplanar VMAT with the head tilted forward. Accordingly, if patients tilt their heads forward when undergoing Linac-based WBRT, we anticipate that a smaller dose would be transmitted to the OAR, resulting in better quality of life following treatment."
2250,Excluded,"[PET-CT for neuroendocrine tumors and nuclear medicine therapy options] Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are defined by biochemical characteristics and structures which can be specifically addressed by radioligands for diagnostic imaging as well as radionuclide therapy in nuclear medicine. Somatostatin receptor imaging has been shown to be an important part of the diagnostic process in the management of NET for a long time. In recent years a number of tracers enabling PET-based imaging of somatostatin receptors and amine precursor uptake have been developed. By combining the specific functional information of the PET signal with anatomical information by CT imaging using PET-CT hybrid scanners, primary tumors and metastases can be detected with high resolution and high sensitivity. Compared with conventional indium-111 octreotide scintigraphy PET-CT has a higher resolution and also a lower radiation exposure. In addition, quantification of the tracer uptake allows therapy monitoring. By labelling with therapeutic beta-emitters, such as lutetium-177 or yttrium-90, a systemic internal radiotherapy with somotostatin analogues (peptide radionuclide radiation therapy, PRRT) can be provided as a therapeutic option for patients with unresectable and metastasized neuroendocrine tumors.

3015,Excluded,"The prospective self-controlled study of two different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion positions for treatment of thoracolumbar fracture in seven-year minimum follow-up Purpose: To test the hypothesis that different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion position would increase the likelihood of facet joint injury and degeneration. Method(s): This prospective study included 35 patients with one-level neurological intact thoracolumbar fracture. From January 2006 to December 2007, patients were randomized underwent posterior reduction and percutaneous pedicle fixation using two different insertion techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiological and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of vertebral body height, kyphotic angle and facet joint degeneration. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Result(s): The operation was completed successfully in 35 patients. All patients were follow-up for an average of 89 months. There were no significant differences in percutaneous pedicle fixation time and radiation dose between two insertion techniques. In the transverse processpedicle group (TG), the length of the pedicle screw were significantly longer than control group (CG). Preoperative kyphotic angle and vertebral body height were significantly improved after surgery, and these has been well maintained at the last follow-up. There was significant differences in the occurrence of facet joint degeneration more than 1 grade between two groups (TG:3 vs. CG:23). All patients had significantly improvement on VAS and ODI scores after surgery, compared with their preoperative period. In the control group, 19 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion(s): The degeneration of facet joint is closely related to the position of the pedicle screw and rod during minimally invasive surgery. Compared with traditional puncture technique, the transverse process-pedicle puncture technique can reduce the facet joint degeneration caused by pedicle screw violation and rod stress, and provide enough space for transpedicular interbody bone grafting."

The DATA (6-amino-1,4-diazapine-triacetate) scaffold represents a novel hybrid chelator architecture possessing both cyclic and acyclic character that may allow for facile access to <sup>68</sup>Ga-labelled tracers in the clinic. We report the first bifunctional DATA chelator conjugated to [Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotide (TOC), a somatostatin subtype 2 receptor (SST<inf>2</inf>)-targeting vector for imaging and functional characterisation of SSTR<inf>2</inf> expressing tumours. Method(s): The radiopharmaceutical precursor, DATA-TOC, was synthesised as previously described and used to complex <sup>nat</sup>Ga(III) and <sup>68</sup>Ga(III). Competition binding assays of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC or [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC against [<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>25</sup>]LTT-SS28 were conducted in membranes of HEK293 cells transfected to stably express one of the hSST<inf>2,3,5</inf> receptor subtypes (HEK293-hSST<inf>2/3/5</inf> cells). First in vivo studies were performed in female NMRI-nude mice bearing SST<inf>2</inf>-positive mouse phaeochromocytoma mCherry (MPC-mCherry) tumours to compare the in vivo SST<inf>2</inf>-specific tumour-targeting of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and its overall pharmacokinetics versus the [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC reference. A direct comparison of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC with the well-established PET radiotracer [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC was additionally performed in a 46-year-old male patient with a well-differentiated NET (neuroendocrine tumour), representing the first in human administration of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC. Result(s): DATA-TOC was labelled with <sup>68</sup>Ga with a radiolabelling efficiency of > 95% in less than 10 min at ambient temperature. A molar activity up to 35 MBq/nmol was achieved. The hSST<inf>2</inf>-affinities of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC were found similar with only sub-nanomolar differences in the respective IC<inf>50</inf> values. In mice, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was able to visualise the tumour lesions, showing standardised uptake values (SUVs) similar to [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. Direct comparison of the two PET tracers in a NET patient revealed very similar tumour uptake for the two <sup>68</sup>Ga-radiotracers, but with a higher tumour-to-liver contrast for [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC.

3000,Excluded,"FDTD analysis of a noninvasive hyperthermia system for brain tumors Hyperthermia is considered one of the new therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment and is based on the difference in thermal sensitivity between healthy tissues and tumors. During hyperthermia treatment, the temperature of the tumor is raised to 40-45degreeC for a definite period resulting in the destruction of cancer cells. This paper investigates design, modeling and simulation of a new non-invasive hyperthermia applicator system capable of effectively heating deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors using inexpensive, simple, and easy to fabricate components without harming surrounding healthy brain tissues. The proposed hyperthermia applicator system is composed of an air filled partial half ellipsoidal chamber, a patch antenna, and a head model with an embedded tumor at an arbitrary location. The irradiating antenna is placed at one of the foci of the hyperthermia chamber while the center of the brain tumor is placed at the other focus. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is used to compute both the SAR patterns and the temperature distribution in three different head models due to two different patch antennas at a frequency of 915 MHz. The obtained results suggest that by using the proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system it is feasible to achieve sufficient and focused energy deposition and temperature rise to therapeutic values in deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors without harming surrounding healthy tissue. The proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system proved suitable for raising the temperature in tumors embedded in the brain to therapeutic values by carefully selecting the systems components. The operator of the system only needs to place the center of the brain tumor at a pre-specified location and excite the antenna at a single frequency of 915 MHz. Our study may provide a basis for a clinical applicator prototype capable of heating brain tumors."
1122,Excluded,"LINAC radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors: retrospective - cohort study of 23 patients Background: Glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs) are uncommon and locally disruptive tumors that usually arise within the jugular foramen of the temporal bone. Surgery was the treatment of choice up until recently. In the last decades, however, radiosurgery has surfaced as a promising alternative treatment by providing excellent tumor control with low risk of cranial nerve injuries. Our aim was to examine the results of radiosurgery specifically, linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (LINAC SRS) for GJT treatment. We hypothesized that radiosurgery will reduce the size of the tumor and improve neurological symptoms. Design and method: Between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2013, 30 patients with GJTs were treated in Sheba Medical Center using LINAC SRS treatment. Comprehensive clinical follow-up was available for 23 patients. Sixteen patients were female and seven males with a median age of 64 years, with a range of 18-87 years. In 19 of the patients, LINAC SRS was the primary treatment, whereas in the remaining four cases, surgery or embolization preceded radiosurgery. The median treated dose to tumor margin was 14 Gy (range 12-27 Gy), and the median tumor volume before treatment was 5 ml (range 0.5-15 ml). Result(s): Following the LINAC SRS treatment, 14 of 23 patients (60%) showed improvement of previous neurological deficits, nine patients (40%) remained unchanged. At the end of a follow-up, tumor reduction was seen in 13 patients and a stable volume in eight (91% tumor control rate). Two cases of tumor progression were noted. Three patients (13%) had post- SRS complications during the follow-up, two of which achieved tumor control, while in one the tumor advanced. Conclusion(s): LINAC SRS is a practical treatment option for GJTs, with a high rate of tumor control and satisfactory neurological improvement.

540,Excluded,"The role of the mammalian DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 pathogenesis DNA strand-breaks (SBs) with non-ligatable ends are generated by ionizing radiation, oxidative stress, various chemotherapeutic agents, and also as base excision repair (BER) intermediates. Several neurological diseases have already been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD."
687,Excluded,"Prospective assessment of white matter integrity in adult stem cell transplant recipients Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is often used in the treatment of hematologic disorders. Although it can be curative, the pre-transplant conditioning regimen can be associated with neurotoxicity. In this prospective study, we examined white matter (WM) integrity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological functioning before and one year after HSCT in twenty-two patients with hematologic disorders and ten healthy controls evaluated at similar intervals. Eighteen patients received conditioning treatment with high-dose (HD) chemotherapy, and four had full dose total body irradiation (fTBI) and HD chemotherapy prior to undergoing an allogeneic or autologous HSCT. The results showed a significant decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in diffuse WM regions one year after HSCT (p-corrected <0.05) in the patient group compared to healthy controls. At baseline, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had higher MD and AD in the left hemisphere WM than autologous HSCT patients (p-corrected <0.05). One year post-transplant, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere and left frontal WM compared to patients treated with autologous HSCT (p-corrected <0.05). There were modest but significant correlations between MD values and cognitive test scores, and these were greatest for timed tests and in projection tracts. Patients showed a trend toward a decline in working memory, and had lower cognitive test scores than healthy controls at the one-year assessment. The findings suggest a relatively diffuse pattern of alterations in WM integrity in adult survivors of HSCT."

Some brain metastases demonstrate significant peritumoral edema; radiation may induce cerebral edema or worsening preexisting edema. This study was conducted to evaluate the imaging and neurobehavioral outcomes in patients with preexisting peritumoral edema who then undergo GKS.METHODS: Between August 2003 and January 2008, 63 cases of brain metastasis with significant peritumoral edema (> 20 cm(3)) were prospectively studied. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a single metastatic lesion with significant edema (perilesional edema signal volume on FLAIR > 20 cm(3)); and 2) inclusion of only 1 lesion > 20 cm(3) in the study (in cases of multiple lesions noted on FLAIR images). All patients received MR imaging with pulse sequences including T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR with or without contrast and T2-weighted imaging at an interval of 3 months. A neurological assessment and Brain Cancer Module (BCM-20) questionnaire were obtained every 2-3 months. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival."

Among them, 42 patients received chemotherapy while 18 patients did not receive after WBRT. With regard to anti-HER2 therapy, after WBRT, 17 patients received anti-HER2 treatment without prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, 7 patients received anti-HER2 treatment with prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and 36 patients did not receive further anti-HER2 treatment. All patients were followed up regularly until January 23, 2013.RESULTS: The median OS of patients with BM was 12 months. Patients who received anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy after WBRT had significantly better survival compared with patients who did not receive further treatment. Patients who received anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT but did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy for early breast cancer had better OS, followed by patients who received anti-HER2 agent both in adjuvant treatment and after WBRT and patients who did not receive anti-HER2 treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that Karnofsky Performance Status, control of extracranial metastases, chemotherapy after WBRT, and anti-HER2 therapy combined with WBRT were all independent predictors for OS.CONCLUSION: Both chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy after WBRT could improve OS. Moreover, patients without prior exposure to adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment may have survival benefit superior to those of patients with prior exposure."

2061,Excluded,"Some perturbations that disturb the circadian melatonin rhythm The circadian melatonin rhythm is highly reproducible and generally not easily altered. The few perturbations that are capable of significantly changing either the amplitude or the pattern of the 24-h melatonin rhythm are summarized herein. Aging alters cyclic melatonin production by decreasing the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin peak in all species in which it has been studied. The best known acute suppressor of nocturnal melatonin is light exposure. The brightness of light required to acutely depress pineal melatonin production is species dependent; of the visible wavelengths, those in the blue range (approximately 500-520 nm) seem most effective in suppressing melatonin production. Nonvisible, nonionizing radiation in the extremely low frequency range (e.g., 60 Hz) seems also capable of altering pineal melatonin synthesis. Hormones have relatively little influence on the circadian production of melatonin, although either adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy does attenuate the amplitude of the melatonin cycle. Exercise at the time of high melatonin production rapidly depresses pineal concentrations of the indole without influencing its synthesis; the mechanism of this suppression remains unknown.

First, previous in vitro data for the swelling of cultured neurons (N18; rat neuroblastoma) and astroglia (C6; rat astroglyoma) upon exposure to a hypoosmotic solution were reappraised. Neurons swelled rapidly, forming blisters, and easily burst. whereas astroglia resisted swelling and slowly assumed a large full-moon shape. The time constant of swelling was 35.2 +/- 7.8 s for N18 and 594.8 +/- 554.0 s for C6. The glial plasmic membrane was found to be much stronger than the neuronal one, presumably due to a well-developed cytoskeleton. To overcome such neuronal membranous weakness, strong astroglial processes need to cover the neurons including the cell body and synapses, as demonstrated electron-microscopically. Next, in situ astroglial swelling was investigated in rats. During K(+)-induced cortical spreading depression, increases or decreases of a wave-ring spread of light (550 nm) transmission through a 1 mm-thick cerebral cortical layer was observed. The moving local optical density decrease in the cortex was attributable to local vascular bed compression induced by astroglial swelling, since concomitant occurrence of colocated dynamic capillary flow stall was confirmed by a hemodilution technique. Astroglial swelling may occur in an ensemble acting during neuronal depolarization, suggesting that neurons and astroglia behave like a unit complex."

The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE."

In this study the effects of the coenzyme Q10 on acute oxidative renal and liver injuries in radiation induced rats were investigated. Material(s) and Method(s): The rats were randomly divided into four groups and each group included 10 rats; group 1 (Control group), group 2 (intraperitoneally CoQ10 administered), group 3 (radiation applied) and group 4 (both radiation applied and intraperitoneally CoQ10 administered). Rats were administered dose of 10mg/kg/day CoQ10 intraperitoneally, and underwent radiation therapy through a posterior portal covering the thorax and the abdomen. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and CoQ10 levels and activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase enzymes in renal tissue were studied. Result(s): MDA levels significantly increased and CoQ10 levels significantly decreased in the liver and kidney tissues of the radiation applied group as compared to the control group (p <0.05). Conclusion(s): These results show that CoQ10 has not adequate protective and antioxidant effects on acute renal and liver tissue injuries in radiation induced rats."

The median apical and scleral tumour dose was 100 Gy (range 15-200 Gy) and 1000 Gy (range 200-1200 Gy), respectively. The median follow up time was 2.8 and 2.0 years (range 1 month to 10 years) for anterior and posterior segment complications, respectively.RESULTS: The 3 and 5 year probabilities of being without radiation cataract were 73% and 63%, without neovascular glaucoma 91% and 81%, without vitreous haemorrhage 83% and 74%, without radiation maculopathy 85% and 70%, and without radiation optic neuropathy 90% and 88%, respectively. The risk of radiation cataract was highest with large tumour size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.0027; height < or = 5 v > 5 mm, p = 0.029; largest basal diameter (LBD) < or = 15 v > 15 mm, p < 0.0001) and location of anterior tumour margin anterior v posterior to the equator (p = 0.0003); the risk of neovascular glaucoma with large size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.039; LBD < or = 15 mm v 15 mm, p = 0.021); and the risk of maculopathy and optic neuropathy with proximity of the posterior tumour margin to the fovea and the optic disc (< or = 1.5 v > 1.5 mm; p = 0.030 and p = 0.0004, respectively). In Cox's multivariate analysis the strongest risk indicator for radiation cataract (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6) and vitreous haemorrhage (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8) was the height of the tumour; for neovascular glaucoma the TNM class (RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.7-13.8); for radiation maculopathy location of posterior tumour margin within 2 mm from the fovea (RR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-6.0); and for radiation optic neuropathy location of tumour margin within 1 DD of the optic disc (RR 6.1, 95% CI 3.0-12.4). The 3 and 5 year probabilities of avoiding enucleation were 92% and 85%, respectively. Ten eyes were enucleated--six because of recurrent tumour growth, three because of treatment complications, and one because of mistakenly suspected extraocular growth.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the frequency of radiation related complications after ruthenium brachytherapy of uveal melanoma is acceptable, in particular as regard irradiation of small and medium sized tumours for which ruthenium therapy generally is recommended."

After CLE early changes of PC included the reduction of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi complex and synaptic ribbons. At 24 hours and 10 days PC secretory activity was increased, while their ultrastructural organization was normalized by 30-180 days. 10 days after XRI degenerative changes were detected in PC that included dilation, fragmentation and vacuolization of RER cisterns, mitochondrial swelling, appearance of large vacuoles and osmiophilic inclusions, increase in lysosome content. Volume density of mitochondria and RER was lower, while that of Golgi complex was higher than in control. PC ultrastructure was restored 30-180 days after XRI. Following CE, the changes in PC ultrastructural organization were more significant at all time interval studied than after the action of single factors. The results obtained indicate that CLE increased the extent of postradiation changes in PC ultrastructural organization during the early time intervals after XRI and at the peak of radiation sickness development."
2736,Excluded,"Crumbs homologue 1 is required for maintenance of photoreceptor cell polarization and adhesion during light exposure Loss of Crumbs homologue 1 (CRB1) function causes either the eye disease Leber congenital amaurosis or progressive retinitis pigmentosa, depending on the amount of residual CRB1 activity and the genetic background. Crb1 localizes specifically to the sub-apical region adjacent to the adherens junction complex at the outer limiting membrane in the retina. We show that it is associated here with multiple PDZ protein 1 (Mupp1), protein associated with Lin-7 (Pals1 or Mpp5) and Mpp4. We have produced Crb1(-/-) mice completely lacking any functional Crb1. Although the retinas are initially normal, by 3-9 months the Crb1(-/-) retinas develop localized lesions where the integrity of the outer limiting membrane is lost and giant half rosettes are formed. After delamination of the photoreceptor layer, neuronal cell death occurs in the inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina. On moderate exposure to light for 3 days at 3 months of age, the number of severe focal retinal lesions significantly increases in the Crb1(-/-) retina. Crb2, Crb3 and Crb1 interacting proteins remain localized to the sub-apical region and therefore are not sufficient to maintain cell adhesion during light exposure in Crb1(-/-) retinas. Thus we propose that during light exposure Crb1 is essential to maintain, but not assemble, adherens junctions between photoreceptors and Muller glia cells and prevents retinal disorganization and dystrophy. Hence, light may be an influential factor in the development of the corresponding human diseases."

The underlying hypothesis was that TRT will improve outcomes in this favorable patient population.METHODS: 305 patients were included in an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, of which 105 received TRT after chemotherapy (ChT) and 200 received ChT alone. The survival outcomes were compared between ChT+TRT group and ChT-alone group in patients with oligometastasis without brain or liver involved and patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, respectively.RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients were 60.3%, 23.9% and 1.6%, respectively. The addition of TRT significantly improved PFS in total patients than ChT alone (14.5 months vs. 10.1 months, p = 0.006), but the OS benefit was not significant (17.8 months vs. 16.5 months, p = 0.061). For patients with oligometastasis (n = 118), TRT offered significant progression free survival (PFS) (16.5 months vs. 9.1 months, p = 0.005) and OS (19.2 months vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.039) benefits. However, for patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, the PFS and OS were not improved with TRT (p = 0.49, p = 0.811).CONCLUSIONS: TRT provided significant PFS and OS benefits in patients with oligometastatic ES-SCLC without brain or liver involved. The consolidative TRT is a reasonable treatment option for this favorable patient population."

Phase 2 trials in BRCA pts as monotherapy or in unselected pts in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy have demonstrated evidence of efficacy. V plus radiation has shown promising efficacy in preclinical models and clinically in combination with WBRT. Method(s): Pts were randomized 1:1:1 to WBRT plus V 50 mg BID (V50), V 200 mg BID (V200), or P BID. Treatment began within 28 days (d) of diagnosis. Pts received 30 Gray WBRT in 10 fractions. V50, V200, or P BID was self-administered starting on d 1 of WBRT and continuing until 1 d after completion. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Survival was assessed at 2 month (m) intervals for 6 m then every 3 m (>=36 m). Pts who received >=1 dose were included in the safety analyses; AEs were compared across arms using Fisher's exact test. Result(s): 307 pts were randomized. OS, intracranial response rate, and time to clinical or radiographic progression were not statistically significantly different between any of the V arms and the P arm. There were no differences in all grade adverse drug reactions (ADRs) across arms and a modest improvement in grade 3/4 AEs in the V arms. Conclusion(s): Although preclinical and early clinical data suggested that V might synergize with radiotherapy, there was no difference in multiple study endpoints between V50 or V200 and P in this setting. Safety parameters observed in the V arms were generally similar to the P arm; no new safety signals of V were identified. (Table Presented)."
657,Excluded,"Skilled motor learning does not enhance long-term depression in the motor cortex in vivo Learning of motor skills may occur as a consequence of changes in the efficacy of synaptic connections in the primary motor cortex. We investigated if learning in a reaching task affects the excitability, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity of horizontal connections in layers II-III of the motor cortex. Because training in this task requires animals to be food-deprived, we compared the trained animals with similarly food-deprived untrained animals and normal controls. The results show that the excitability, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity of the studied horizontal connections were unaffected by motor learning. However, stress-related effects produced by food deprivation and handling significantly enhanced the expression of long-term depression in these pathways. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the acquisition of a complex motor skill produces bi-directional changes in synaptic strength that are distributed throughout the complex neural networks of motor cortex, which remains synaptically balanced during learning. The results are incompatible with the idea that learning causes large unidirectional changes in the population response of these neural networks, which may occur instead during certain behavioral states, such as stress."

The number of D1 receptors (labelled by [3H]SCH 23390) declined monoexponentially with increasing radiation intensity, yielding a molecular weight (mol.wt.) of 80 kDa. Also the activity of the catalytic unit (C) of the adenylate cyclase (as measured by forskolin stimulation), decreased monoexponentially, however with a mol.wt. of 145 kDa. Both basal, DA- and fluoride (F-)-stimulated activity declined in a concave-downward fashion with a limiting mol.wt. of 134, 138 and 228 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that the basal and DA-stimulated activity originated from an enzyme complex with a mol.wt. of 325 kDa, a value close to the combined size of RGs and C. These data suggest that F- stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, which occurs by a Gs activation, does not cause dissociation of Gs into the alpha s and beta gamma subunits. Further, the DA-regulated adenylate cyclase apparently exists as a complex consisting of RGs and C; the mechanism of hormonal activation is a dissociation of C from this complex."

In humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most studied prion disease. In animals, the most frequent prion diseases are scrapie in sheep and goat, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and the emerging chronic wasting disease in wild and captive deer in North America. The hallmark of prion diseases is the deposition in the brain of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, an abnormal beta-sheet-rich form of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) (Prusiner 1982). According to the prion hypothesis, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can trigger the autocatalytic conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, presumably in the presence of cofactors (lipids and small RNAs) that have been recently identified. In this review, we will come back to the original works that led to the discovery of prions and to the protein-only hypothesis proposed by Dr. Prusiner. We will then describe the recent reports on mammalian synthetic prions and recombinant prions that strongly support the protein-only hypothesis. The new concept of ""deformed templating"" regarding a new mechanism of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and replication will be exposed. The review will end with a chapter on the prion-like propagation of other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and tauopathies.

We based the exposure assessment on measurements from 1,015 different workplaces. On the basis of the job held longest during the 10-year period before diagnosis, we found an association between the average, daily, mean level of EMF and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The risk increased with increasing level of exposure. The odds ratios (OR) and the 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for three consecutive levels of exposure were: 1.1 (CI = 0.5-2.3); 2.2 (CI = 1.1-4.3); 3.0 (CI = 1.6-5.8), respectively. No association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.0, CI = 0.5-1.8; OR = 0.8, CI = 0.4-1.6; OR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.9). For brain tumors, the corresponding risk estimates were 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.6); 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2); 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1). Different EMF indices were tested. Tasks with frequent or large variations between high and low field-densities (high standard deviation) were more common among CLL subjects. For brain tumors, a prolonged high level (high median values) showed the strongest association. Confounding by place of residence, smoking, benzene, ionizing radiation, pesticides, and solvents was evaluated, and these factors did not seem to have a decisive influence on the associations. We also analyzed other potential sources of bias. For CLL, there were indications of an excess number of low-exposure subjects among non-responders, which, to some extent, may have enhanced but not caused the risk estimates obtained. Our conclusion is that the study supports the hypothesis that occupational EMF exposure is a hazard in the development of certain cancers."
2076,Excluded,"Radiation and Immunotherapy in High-grade Gliomas: Where Do We Stand? High-grade glioma is the most common primary brain tumor, with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) accounting for 52% of all brain tumors. The current standard of care (SOC) of GBM involves surgery followed by adjuvant fractionated radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, little progress has been made in extending overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life. Attempts to characterize and customize treatment of GBM have led to mitigating the deleterious effects of radiotherapy using hypofractionated radiotherapy, as well as various immunotherapies as a promising strategy for the incurable disease. A combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy may prove to be even more effective than either alone, and preclinical evidence suggests that hypofractionated radiotherapy can actually prime the immune system to make immunotherapy more effective. This review addresses the complications of the current radiotherapy regimen, various methods of immunotherapy, and preclinical and clinical data from combined radioimmunotherapy trials."

METHODS The records of 270 patients with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. Pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. The cumulative incidences of first DBF and salvage WBRT were calculated. Significant factors were used to create a score for stratifying early (6-month) DBF risk. RESULTS No prior WBRT, a total lesion volume < 1.3 cm<sup>3</sup>, primary breast cancer or malignant melanoma histology, and multiple metastases (>=2) were found to be significant predictors of early DBF. Each factor was ascribed 1 point because of similar hazard ratios. Scores of 0 to 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were considered to indicate low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. This correlated with 6-month cumulative incidences of DBF of 16.6%, 28.8%, and 54.4%, respectively (P < .001). For patients without prior WBRT, the 6-month cumulative incidence of salvage WBRT was 2%, 17.7%, and 25.7%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Early DBF after SRS requiring salvage WBRT remains a significant clinical problem. Patient stratification for early DBF can better inform the decision for the initial treatment strategy for brain metastases. The provided risk score may help to predict early DBF and subsequent salvage WBRT if SRS is initially used. External validation is needed before clinical implementation. Cancer 2015;121:3836-3843.

The most probable practice changing data came from the presentation of the PROFILE 1014 trial dealing with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients treated with crizotinib or chemotherapy in the first-line setting, which confirmed a comparable degree of benefit from crizotinib treatment as reported in second-line treatment. After 10 years of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy, there were for the first time reports on phase I data on new agents showing efficacy in tyrosine-kinase inhibitor pre-treated patients with secondary resistance (i.e. T790M mutation). Monoclonal antibodies directed against EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor given in addition to conventional chemotherapy (SQUIRE and REVEL, respectively) resulted in significant but less impressive results. Notable improvements in overall survival in these two studies were not restricted to patients with adenocarcinoma but proved beneficial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma as well.

2388,Excluded,"The ketone body s-hydroxybutyrate radiosensitizes glioblastoma multiforme stem cells Glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) is amalignant brain tumor that typically recurs following standard treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A rare population of radio-chemoresistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) is implicated in tumor repopulation and progression following treatment. Improvement in the prognosis of these patients requires the development of new therapeutic approaches. One emerging strategy is to target aberrant cell metabolism, a trait shared by virtually all tumor cells. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, low carbohydrate and protein metabolic therapy has demonstrated anti-tumor effects alone, and in combination with radiation. The KD prolongs survival in animal glioma models, and when used in conjunction with radiation 9 of 11micewere cured of their implanted tumors. We are now extending this work to determine if the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) radiosensitizes human GSCs in vitro. The effects of betaHB on growth were examined at various betaHB concentrations in two GSC lines, L0andL1. Both 5mM and 10 mM betaHB significantly reduced GSC growth. When coupled with 4Gy of radiation, 5mM betaHB treatment significantly reduced L1 neurosphere formation and frequency, more than either betaHB treatment or radiation alone. In L0, combination treatment significantly reduced neurosphere formation and frequency, more than radiation alone. To explore underlying mechanisms we are investigating the effect of betaHB on DNA damage and repair in GSCs. Additionally, we are determining the effect of betaHB on hypoxia within GSC neurospheres by analyzing expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase 9. We previously showed that the KD reduced the expression of these genes in a mouse glioma model. Taken altogether, these data suggest that betaHB may sensitize GBMs to radiation by inhibiting growth of both glioma cells and GSCs, which may have implications for its use to treat tumor recurrence."
3069,Excluded,"Nonlinear modeling of auditory-nerve rate responses to wideband stimuli The spectral selectivity of auditory nerve fibers was characterized by a method based on responses to random-spectrum-shape stimuli. The method models the average discharge rate of fibers for steady stimuli and is based on responses to approximately 100 noise-like stimuli with pseudorandom spectral levels in 1/8- or 1/16-octave frequency bins. The model assumes that rate is determined by a linear weighting of the spectrum plus a second-order weighting of all pairs of spectrum values within a certain frequency range of best frequency. The method allows prediction of rate responses to stimuli with arbitrary wideband spectral shapes, thus providing a direct test of the degree of linearity of spectral processing Auditory-nerve fibers are shown to rely mainly on linear weighting of the stimulus spectrum; however, significant second-order terms are present and are important in predicting responses to random-spectrum shape stimuli, although not for predicting responses to noise filtered with cat head-related transfer functions. The second-order terms weight the products of levels at identical frequencies positively and the products of different frequencies negatively. As such, they model both curvature in the rate versus level function and suppressive interactions between different frequency components. The first- and second-order characterizations derived in this method provide a measure of higher-order nonlinearities in neurons, albeit without providing information about temporal characteristics."

We assessed relationships between BMI, physician's preference of functional test, test positivity, and results of invasive coronary angiography (Cath) using logistic regression models.RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of the patients had BMI>=30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 20% had BMI>=35. Providers were more likely to prefer nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over other functional tests as BMI increased. The rate of test positivity with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was not different (10% vs. 12%) in patients with BMI >=35 vs. < 35. The same was true for stress echocardiogram and stress electrocardiogram (positivity 8-13%, P>0.8 for both). In contrast, MPI was significantly more likely to be positive in those with BMI >=35 vs. <35 (18% vs. 13%; P=0.001). The likelihood of obstructive CAD at Cath did not differ with BMI >=35 vs. <35 in patients having CTA (52% vs. 59%, P=0.22), but among MPI patients, Cath positivity was only 29% with BMI >=35 vs. 48% with BMI <35 (P=0.005).

Both AT and FA cell lines, and patients, are characterized by abnormally high levels of oxidative stress markers. The key FA protein FANCD2 is phosphorylated on Ser 222 by ATM after ionizing radiation (IR), thus allowing normal activation of the S-phase checkpoint, and ATM cells are known to be hypersensitive to oxidative damage. In this work we show that FANCD2 deficient cells have a defective S-phase checkpoint after Hydrogen Peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced oxidative damage. ATM dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 at the S222 residue is necessary for normal S-phase checkpoint activation after oxidative stress, while FANCD2 monoubiquitination at K561 is dispensable. We also show that FANCD2 is not required for base excision repair of 8-oxoG and other DNA lesions (abasic sites, uracils), while treatments that exclusively induce 8-oxoG, but not DNA double strand breaks, fail to activate FANCD2 monoubiquitination, thus indicating that the known accumulation of 8-oxoG in FA cells reflects an overproduction of ROS rather than defective processing of oxidized bases. We conclude that the handling of DNA damage after H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress requires the coordinated action of FANCD2 and ATM."

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of this new anesthetic protocol during HDR-ICRT for cervical cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All the patients who were diagnosed with cervical cancer between December 2008 and February 2011, treated with three-channel brachytherapy and subjected to the new sedation protocol, were evaluated. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain during brachytherapy, and we collected VAS score at the next HDR-ICRT. Toxicities were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.RESULTS: A total of 178 sessions of HDR-ICRT were delivered to 57 patients. The patients' median VAS pain score was 0 (range, 0-10). The most frequent side effect was Grade 1-2 nausea, which occurred in 33 sessions (34%). However, 13 of 14 patients received concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy. None of the patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that our new intravenous anesthetic protocol produces appropriate effects and can be performed by radiation oncologists who were required to finish training in basic life support and the cooperative system of emergency according to in-house guideline."
111,Excluded,"Timing and characteristics of perceptual attenuation by transcranial stimulation: a study using magnetic cortical stimulation and somatosensory-evoked potentials Transcranial cortical magnetic stimulation (CMS) is a noninvasive, non-noxious procedure to induce perceptual attenuation when applied concomitant to sensory stimuli. To investigate the perceptual timing of simple stimulus features in the somatosensory modality, we applied right hemisphere CMS at different intervals following a stimulus delivered to the left hand. Different intervals between peripheral stimuli and CMS were defined according to the components of the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP), previously obtained in response to the same stimulus. Perceptual attenuation was maximal when CMS coincided with the primary cortical response (parietal N20 potential); conversely, perception of stimulus intensity was not modified when CMS was concomitant with the N200 and P300 potentials. Using small CMS intensities, a ""perceptual dip"" was observed when CMS arrived in coincidence with the N120 potential, a SEP response thought to be originated in part in the second somatic area. Our results support the view that both N200 and P300 are post-perceptual responses. The results also suggest that the cortical processes active during the N20 and N120 potentials may be essential for the conscious perception of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the hand."

The transdermal route of administration is worthy of investigation for patients who suffer from dysphagia due to severe oral mucositis. In this phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl (TDF) for mucositis pain caused by chemoradiotherapy in ESCC patients.METHODS: Forty-six ESCC patients who experienced moderate to severe oral mucosal pain during chemoradiotherapy received TDF for pain relief. The assessment of pain was made according to the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Efficacy and safety of TDF was collected and conducted in an open-label fashion. The analgesic effect, quality of life, and side effects were evaluated after the administration of transdermal fentanyl using the paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank test.RESULTS: The mucositis-induced pain disappeared in 31 (67.4 %) patients during the treatment with transdermal fentanyl with the median time of onset at day 6.6 (range 3-14). The median Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score was reduced from 6 (range 3-9) before treatment to 4.5 (range 2-9), 3 (range 2-8), 2.5 (range 1-8), 2 (range 0-6), and 0 (range 0-4) on days 3, 6, 9, 11, and 15, respectively, after treatment (P < 0.001). The patients' quality of life also improved significantly (P < 0.01).

We have studied the formation of actin structures in growing neurites by microinjecting fluorescent phalloidin or actin into PC12 neuron-like cells to label endogenous actin filaments. Upon stimulation of neurite growth in cells microinjected with fluorescent phalloidin, little or no fluorescence was detected in nascent growth cones and adjacent neurites despite the presence of actin filaments in these regions, suggesting that actin filaments were primarily formed by de novo assembly rather than the transport and reorganization of pre-existing, phalloidin-labeled actin filaments. Time-lapse observations of the distribution of phalloidin-labeled actin filaments during neurite elongation confirmed that fluorescence associated with pre-existing neurite cortex spread out more slowly than the elongation of neurites. Furthermore, when a dark spot was photobleached with a laser microbeam along neurites of cells microinjected with either fluorescent phalloidin or actin, the spot showed no appreciable translocation during active neurite elongation. Taken together, these results suggest that de novo assembly of actin filaments plays a crucial role in the formation of growth cones and adjacent cortex in the distal region of neurites, but does not appear to require the anterograde or retrograde transport of cortical filaments, or the passive stretching of the proximal segment of the neurite cortex."
1971,Excluded,"Nuclear double-fluorescent reporter for in vivo and ex vivo analyses of biological transitions in mouse nuclei Cre-responsive dual-fluorescent alleles allow in situ marking of cell lineages or genetically modified cells. Here we report a dual-fluorescent allele, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> , which directs nuclear accumulation of tdTomato in Cre-naive lineages. Cre converts the allele to ROSA <sup>nG</sup> , which drives nuclear EGFP accumulation. Conditions were established for analyzing marked nuclei by flow cytometry on the basis of red-green fluorescence and ploidy, with a particular focus on liver nuclei. Hydrodynamic delivery of a Cre-expression plasmid was used to time-stamp arbitrary hepatocytes for lineage tracing. The distinct green fluorescence of nuclei from Cre-exposed lineages facilitated analyses of ploidy transitions within clones. To assess developmental transitions in liver nuclei, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> was combined with the hepatocyte-specific AlbCre transgene, facilitating discrimination between hepatocyte and nonhepatocyte nuclei. Nuclei extracted from postnatal day 2 (P2) livers were 41 % green and 59 % red and reached a stable level of 84 % green by P22. Until P20, green nuclei were >98 % diploid (2N); at P40 they were ~56 % 2N, 43 % 4N, and <1 % 8N; and by P70 they reached a stable distribution of ~46 % 2N, 45 % 4N, and 9 % 8N. In conclusion, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> will facilitate in vivo and ex vivo studies on liver and will likely be valuable for studies on tissues like muscle, kidney, or brain in which cells are refractory to whole-cell flow cytometry, or like trophectoderm derivatives or cancers in which cells undergo ploidy transitions."
2360,Included,"Gamma irradiation inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in rats after arterial injury BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restenosis complicates a significant proportion of endovascular and open vascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy. In contrast to the primary atheroma, restenosis is characterized by intimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that gamma radiation would reduce restenosis by limiting intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.METHODS: To demonstrate the effect of gamma radiation on smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo, a standardized bilateral carotid balloon catheter arterial injury was produced in 37 rats. A single dose of 750, 1500, or 2250 cGy (1cGy = 1 rad) gamma radiation was delivered to the right carotid artery at either 1 or 2 days after injury; the shielded contralateral carotid artery served as matched control. At 21 days after injury, vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ, and cross-sectional area of neointima was determined from axial sections using image analysis.RESULTS: Marked reductions in neointimal cross-sectional area were demonstrated in vessels subjected to 1500- and 2250-cGy radiation at both 1 and 2 days after injury. A less prominent effect was noted for 750 cGy, reaching statistical significance only at 2 days after injury. By two-way ANOVA, radiation dose (P = .0002), timing of radiation delivery (P = .003), and an interaction between timing and dose (P = .0278) were significantly associated with reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. At 1500 cGy, delivery of radiation 1 day after injury inhibited neointimal hyperplasia more prominently than the same dose 2 days after injury; a dose-response relation was evident at 1 day.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation may be an important adjunctive therapy for reducing the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty or endarterectomy."
195,Excluded,"Neurovestibular symptoms following space flight Neurovestibular symptoms experienced by astronauts in the post-flight period were examined using data from medical debriefs contained in the NASA Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health database. Ten symptoms were identified (clumsiness, difficulty concentrating, persisting sensation aftereffects, nausea, vomiting, vertigo while walking, vertigo while standing, difficulty walking a straight line, blurred vision, and dry heaves), of which eight were crossed with twelve demographic parameters (mission duration, astronaut gender, age, one-g piloting experience, previous space flight experience, g-suit inflation, g-suit deflation, in-flight space motion sickness, in-flight exercise, post-flight exercise, mission role, fluid loading). Three symptoms were experienced by a majority of subjects, and another two by more than a quarter of the subjects. Intensity of the symptoms was mild, suggesting that they are unlikely to pose a risk to the crew during landing and the post-flight period. Seven of the symptoms and eight of the parameters under study were found to be significantly associated with each other."
672,Excluded,"Dose-dependent white matter damage after brain radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain radiotherapy is limited in part by damage to white matter, contributing to neurocognitive decline. We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy. Greater changes were observed at low b-values, suggesting prominent extracellular changes possibly due to vascular permeability and neuroinflammation."

Materials/Methods: A total of 10 patients were entered into this phase II study of mNGF for the treatment of symptomatic temporal lobe radiation necrosis. All patients had undergone definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) years before, and were required to have radiographic or biopsy proved temporal lobe radiation necrosis and progressive neurologic symptoms or signs. mNGF was dissolved in 2ml normal saline, and then injected intramuscularly at 18mg/time, once a day for 2 months. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at 3 - 4 weeks after the use of mNGF and clinical signs and symptoms defined the response or progression. Result(s): The only side effect observed was mild pain at the injection site in 2 patients. The volumes of necrosis estimated on T1- weighted gadolinium- enhanced MRI scans demonstrated that 2 patients achieved complete response, 5patients achieved partial response, and 3 patients did not respond. The neurologic symptoms or signs disappeared completely in 4 patients, improved in 4 patients, and had no change in 2 patients. Conclusion(s): This phase II trial demonstrated that the mNGF is effective for the treatment of temporal lobe radiation necrosis with minimal side effects. Prospective placebo controlled randomized study is justified to test further its routine use for people with radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis."
1281,Excluded,"Bremsstrahlung dose of 165Dy in radiosynovectomy There has been an increased interest in 165Dy radiossynovectomy, which emits relatively high-energy (> 1 MeV) beta rays. The production of in vivo bremsstrachlung radiation hazards warrants evaluation. The bremsstrahlung component of the decay scheme of 165Dy has been traditionally ignored in internal dosimetry calculations. We have estimated the bremsstrahlung dose of 165Dy distributed in muscle and bone to body by various internal organs (adrenals, brain, breasts, gallbladder wall, LLI wall, small intestine, stomach, ULI wall, heart wall, kidneys, liver, lungs, muscle, ovaries, pancreas, red marrow, bone surfaces, skin, spleen, testes, thymus, thyroid, urine bladder wall, uterus, fetus, placenta, and total body) during radiosynovictomy. In the present study, muscle and bone are considered to be source organs. These estimated values show that the bremsstrahlung radiation absorbed dose contribution from an organ to itself is very small compared to that originating from the beta source. However, contribution to other organs is not always negligible, especially when large amounts of 165Dy may be involved, such as in therapy applications. Hence the component of the total dose due to bremsstrahlung dose should be considered in radiosynovictomy or other therapy applications."
189,Excluded,"Blink reflexes in patients with atypical odontalgia and matched healthy controls Atypical odontalgia (AO) is an orofacial pain condition which has been suggested to involve neuropathic pain mechanisms. The aim of this study was to use a brain stem reflex to investigate craniofacial nociceptive mechanisms in AO. In 38 AO patients and 27 matched healthy controls, the R2 component of the blink reflex (BR) was elicited using a ""nociceptive-specific"" electrode and recorded with surface electromyography electrodes on both orbicularis oculi muscles. The BR was tested by stimulation of both sides of the face of the participants before, during, and after an intraoral pain provocation test with capsaicin. The data were analyzed with three- and four-way mixed-model analyses of variance. The root mean square value of the ipsilateral R2 (R2i) was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls (P=0.046). No differences in R2 between stimulation sides were detected in either group (P>0.757). In all participants, R2 responses and the intensity of the pain evoked by the electrical stimulus were decreased during and after application of capsaicin compared with baseline (P<0.001). In patients, R2i onset latencies were significantly prolonged compared with controls (P=0.031). The present data show disturbances in the central processing of craniofacial information and that endogenous pain inhibitory systems in AO patients and healthy controls were activated to a similar degree by an acute intraoral nociceptive input. Additional clinical research with AO patients will be needed to determine to what extent neuropathic pain mechanisms are involved in this pain condition."
603,Excluded,"An institutional review of hospital resource utilization and patient radiation exposure in shunted idiopathic intracranial hypertension Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) frequently utilize healthcare services and undergo radiological studies to assess refractory headache symptoms despite cerebrospinal fluid diversion. To delineate the clinical utility of different imaging modalities and to estimate cumulative patient radiation exposure in shunted patients with IIH, we retrospectively reviewed 100 randomly selected patients with IIH and a prior cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure treated at our institution between July 2010 and August 2018. Patients had an average of 16.3 office (SD +/- 13.8), 12.4 emergency department (+/- 21.0), and 4.6 inpatient (+/- 5.1) encounters over an average 4.8 years of follow-up. Patients underwent an average of 9.0 head CTs (+/- 8.1), 10.3 shunt series x-rays (+/- 11.2), and 4.3 MRIs (+/- 3.7). Approximated radiation exposure per patient was 21.4 mSv (+/- 18.7). Radiological studies performed for acute symptoms usually demonstrated no actionable findings (82.5% CTs, 97.5% shunt series x-rays, and 79.6% MRIs). Shunted IIH patients undergo numerous radiological studies and are subject to considerable levels of radiation, yet imaging shows actionable findings in less than 10% percent of radiographic studies.

291,Excluded,"Dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide in rat striatal slices The present study explored the mechanisms underlying the dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide, a compound commonly used as a 5-HT3 receptor agonist. Phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, enhanced the outflow of radioactivity from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [3H]dopamine. The presence of the dopamine uptake blocker nomifensin prevented the increase in outflow. The effect of phenylbiguanide was not antagonized by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, did not require the presence of Ca2+ in the superfusion buffer, and also occurred in reserpinized preparations with depleted dopamine stores. Phenylbiguanide caused a greater shift in the distribution of superfusate radioactivity from DOPAC to dopamine than did nomifensin. All these results are in agreement with an exchange mechanism by which phenylbiguanide promotes the efflux of dopamine by operation of the uptake carrier in the reversed direction. In consonance, phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, inhibited the binding of [3H]CFT to dopamine uptake sites, although the rank order for promoting outflow, serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide greater than 2-methyl-serotonin, differed from that for inhibiting [3H]CFT binding to dopamine uptake sites, 2-methylserotonin approximately serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide. The present results raised the possibility that phenylbiguanide has an additional activity in releasing vesicular dopamine into the cytoplasmic pool."
2361,Excluded,"Analysis of treatment outcome after stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus meningiomas OBJECT: The long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus (CS) meningiomas is not fully understood. The authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with 40 CS meningiomas treated with gamma knife radiosurgery.METHODS: Follow-up periods for the 40 patients ranged from 12 to 123 months (median 42 months), and the overall tumor control rates were 86.4% at 3 years and 82.3% at 10 years. Factors associated with tumor recurrence in univariate analysis were histological malignancy (p < 0.0001), partial treatment (p < 0.0001), suprasellar tumor extension (p = 0.0201), or extension in more than three directions outside the CS (p = 0.0345). When the tumor was completely covered with a dose to the margin that was higher than 14 Gy (Group A, 22 patients), no patient showed recurrence within the median follow-up period of 37 months. On the other hand, when a part of the tumor was treated with 10 to 12 Gy (Group B, 15 patients) or did not receive radiation therapy (Group C, three patients), the recurrence rates were 20% and 100%, respectively. Neurological deterioration was seen in nine patients, but all symptoms were transient or very mild.CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that stereotactic radiosurgery can control tumor growth if the whole mass can be irradiated by dosages of more than 14 Gy. When optimal radiosurgical planning is not feasible because of a tumor's large size, irregular shape, or proximity to visual pathways, use of limited surgical resection before radiosurgery is the best option and should provide sufficient long-term tumor control with minimal complications."
588,Excluded,"Skin denervation, neuropathology, and neuropathic pain in a laser-induced focal neuropathy Small-diameter sensory nerves innervating the skin are responsive to noxious stimuli, and an injury to these nerves is presumably related to neuropathic pain. Injury-induced neuropathic pain in animals can be produced by laser irradiation, which usually requires concomitant use of photosensitive dyes, known as the photochemical approach. It is not clear whether laser irradiation alone can induce neuropathic pain. In addition, two issues are important to apply these approaches: the relationship between the extent of laser irradiation and the occurrence of neuropathic pain, and the susceptibility of small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin to laser-induced neuropathic pain. To address these issues, we designed a new model of focal neuropathy by applying a diode laser of 532 nm (100 mW) to the sciatic nerve and evaluated small-diameter nerves by quantifying skin innervation and large-diameter nerves by measuring amplitudes of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP). Immediately after laser irradiation, epineurial vessels were occluded due to the formation of thrombi, and the blood flow through these vessels was markedly reduced. On postoperative day (POD) 2, animals developed characteristic manifestations of neuropathic pain, including spontaneous pain behaviors, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia. These phenomena peaked during PODs 7-21, and lasted for 3-6 weeks. The neuropathology at the irradiated site of the sciatic nerve included a focal area of axonal degeneration surrounded by demyelination and endoneurial edema. The extent of damage to large-diameter motor and sensory nerves after laser irradiation was evaluated by nerve conduction studies. On the irradiated sides, amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were reduced to 65.0% (P < 0.0001) and 42.5% (P < 0.01) of those on the control sides, respectively. Motor innervation of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) on plantar muscles was examined by combined cholinesterase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. The ratio of innervated NMJs on the operated sides decreased to 76.3% of that on the control side. Skin innervation in the territory of the irradiated sciatic nerves was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with neuronal markers. Among these markers, epidermal nerve densities for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP) were significantly lower on the irradiated sides than the control sides with a different degree of loss for each marker (42.1-53.1%, P < 0.05). Results suggest that laser-induced focal neuropathy provides a new system for studying neuropathic pain. With this approach, the extent of nerve injury can be quantified. Both small-diameter epidermal nerves and large-diameter sensory and motor nerves are susceptible to laser-induced injury of different degrees."

OBJECTIVE(S): We assessed the relationship between patient and tumor characteristics, treatment, and overall survival (OS). METHOD(S):We conducted a retrospective review of 196 patients who received brain radiation for BCBMbetween 2009-2013 at Mayo Clinic. Primary tumor characteristics were collected, including simplified molecular subtype. Other characteristics included patient's ECOG, number of brain lesions at BCBM diagnosis, and treatment received, including neurosurgery, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The primary endpoint was OS from time of BCBM diagnosis. RESULT(S): Single-variable analysis revealed patients with HER2+ breast cancer had improved OS (HR = 0:6, p = 0:008). Compared to patients with 1-3 brain lesions, the risk of death in patients with leptomeningeal disease was 2.5-fold higher (p = 0:003). Worsening ECOG status was associated with worsening OS. Patients who received SRS and WBRT had improved OS (HR = 0:37, p < 0:001) compared to patients receiving WBRT alone. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with the best OS had an ECOG of 0, HER2<sup>+</sup> disease, and 1-3 brain lesions. The best OS was associated with the combination of neurosurgery and radiation therapy. A comprehensive treatment plan including neurosurgical evaluation and radiation therapy should be considered for patients with BCBM. Copyright Â© 2016 - IOS Press and the authors."

Tumor size was >10 cm in 74% of patients and grade was high in 77%. Preoperative IMRT was given to 7 patients (50 Gy) and postoperative IMRT (median dose, 63 Gy) was given to 24 patients. Complete gross resection including periosteal stripping or bone resection was required in 10, and neurolysis or nerve resection in 20. The margins were positive or within 1 mm in 17. Complications from surgery and radiation therapy (RT) were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 23 months. Grade 1 RT dermatitis developed in 71% of patients, Grade 2 in 16%, and Grade 3 in 10%. Infectious wound complications developed in 13% and noninfectious complications in 10%. Two patients (6.4%) developed fractures. Grade 1 neuropathy developed in 28% of patients and Grade 2 in 5%. The rates of Grade 1 and 2 joint stiffness were each 19%. Grade 1 edema was observed in 19% of patients and Grade 2 in 13%. The 2-year local control, distant control, and overall survival were 95%, 65%, and 81%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Intensity modulated RT appears to provide excellent local control in a difficult group of high-risk patients.

1767,Excluded,"Adaptive spatio-temporal filtering of multichannel surface EMG signals A motor unit (MU) is defined as an anterior horn cell, its axon, and the muscle fibres innervated by the motor neuron. A surface electromyogram (EMG) is a superposition of many different MU action potentials (MUAPs) generated by active MUs. The objectives of this study were to introduce a new adaptive spatio-temporal filter, here called maximum kurtosis filter (MKF), and to compare it with existing filters, on its performance to detect a single MUAP train from multichannel surface EMG signals. The MKF adaptively chooses the filter coefficients by maximising the kurtosis of the output. The proposed method was compared with five commonly used spatial filters, the weighted low-pass differential filter (WLPD) and the marginal distribution of a continuous wavelet transform. The performance was evaluated using simulated EMG signals. In addition, results from a multichannel surface EMG measurement fro from a subject who had been previously exposed to radiation due to cancer were used to demonstrate an application of the method. With five time lags of the MKF, the sensitivity was 98.7% and the highest sensitivity of the traditional filters was 86.8%, which was obtained with the WLPD. The positive predictivities of these filters were 87.4 and 80.4%, respectively. Results from simulations showed that the proposed spatio-temporal filtration technique significantly improved performance as compared with existing filters, and the sensitivity and the positive predictivity increased with an increase in number of time lags in the filter.

Anti-inflammation treatment may provide therapeutic benefits. Corilagin (beta-1-O-galloyl-3, 6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-glucose, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>18</sub>) was a novel member of the tannin family with anti-inflammatory properties and is isolated from some medicinal plants, such as Phyllanthus amarus and Caesalpinia coriaria. In this study, the effect of Corilagin on RIBI was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were explored. Spatial learning and memory ability of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy were used to assess the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, were measured by using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activation of microglial cells and expression of TNF-alpha were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and IkappaBalpha, and the translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus were detected by using Western blotting. Morris water maze test showed that Corilagin ameliorated the neurocognitive deficits in RIBI mice. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy exhibited that Corilagin partially protected the BBB integrity from cranial irradiation-caused damage; immunofluorescence staining showed that Corilagin could inhibit microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression. Real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that Corilagin downregulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and inhibited the irradiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB pathways by upregulating p-STAT3 expression. In conclusion, Corilagin could attenuate RIBI through inhibiting microglial activation and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines. Corilagin might inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB pathway in a STAT3-associated manner, thereby downregulating the inflammatory cytokine expressions."

The esophageal primary control rate was 34% and the 5-year survival rate was 24.1%. We believe that external irradiation therapy followed by additional intracavitary radium irradiation produces good results. Also, from 1982, 30 patients with small residual or unresectable tumors received interstitial irradiation using an after-loading technique and iridium-192 seeds. Eighteen of these 30 patients treated with iridium-192 were recurrent cases, and 20 had outer tubes intra-operatively inserted into the tumor following iridium-192 irradiation.

663,Excluded,"A role for oligodendrocytes in the stabilization of optic axon numbers Differentiated oligodendrocytes express neurite growth inhibitory proteins at a time when these cells are involved in the myelination of recently formed fiber pathways. As the process of myelination follows the completion of neurite outgrowth and is concurrent with the stabilization of fiber numbers in a pathway, we set out to determine whether myelination and fiber tract stability could be causally related. Myelin formation was prevented in the rat retinofugal pathway by x-irradiating the optic nerves during oligodendrocyte proliferation. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis of irradiated optic nerves at P15 showed that oligodendrocytes and myelin were virtually absent. Optic fiber numbers were determined at 2 weeks of age throughout the length of normal and x-irradiated nerves. In some cases, normal or irradiation-treated pups were intraocularly injected with FGF 5 d prior to the fiber count in order to promote neurite outgrowth. Axon counts showed that the total fiber number in a myelin-free optic nerve was 10-30% higher than that of a myelinated nerve. Further, fiber numbers fluctuated by as much as 20% along the length of a myelin-free nerve but were relatively constant throughout the length of a myelinated nerve. Treatment of myelinated nerves with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) had no effect on either total fiber numbers or fiber number fluctuation. Conversely, fiber numbers in myelin-free/FGF-treated optic nerves were as much as 40% higher than in normals. Furthermore, total fiber numbers along the length of these nerves fluctuated by up to 34%. These results indicate that, in the absence of myelination, optic fibers are able to form sprouts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Overall mean levels of breast and arm symptoms were low, but with large individual variations. At all six time points, the mean levels of breast symptoms were significantly higher than those of arm symptoms. Overall, the mean level of both types of symptoms decreased during follow-up. A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater and breast symptoms at eight months were associated with having breast symptoms at two years. Arm symptoms at baseline and at eight months, and radiation therapy and a BMI of 25 or greater were associated with having arm symptoms at two years.CONCLUSIONS: Breast symptoms show different patterns of change and are not associated with the same factors as arm symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: For nurses monitoring women treated for breast cancer, the results of this study provide knowledge regarding the importance of early symptom identification and long-term symptoms after treatment."

Cases with distant disease findings were assessed, investigating changes in the modality or intent of treatment and change in stage IV. One thousand four hundred seventy six studies were derived from the Radiotherapy department between April/09 and December/13. Three hundred and seventy three (25,3%) were performed for radiotherapy planning (267 males and 106 females, mean age 68.2 years). The intention of radiotherapy was for radical treatment planning. Result(s): In 45 of these studies (12%) there were previously not suspected findings that suggested an upstage of the patients to a clinical stage IV. The unexpected disease was located more frequently in bone (12 patients), followed by lung (9 patients), liver (10), distant adenopathy (6 patients), brain (4 patients), adrenal glands (4 patients), spleen (1 patient) and multiple progression (1 patient).In twenty-six (26/45, 7%) of these patients the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed as true positive for distant metastasis with complementary examinations. In sixteen (16/26) of them the modality of treatment was changed. In ten of them (10/26) the intent of treatment was changed from curative to palliative. In three patients a second primary tumour was confirmed.In remaining sixteen (16/45) patients the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT could not be initially confirmed. The confirmation was made by monitoring progression in eleven patients, one patient remained with stable disease and four patients died without being able to confirm the findings. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET/CT studies in radiotherapy planning improve the staging of patients, leading to an upstage in a significant number of patients. Based upon the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the modality or the intent of treatment may radically change, (making unnecessary radiation) or changing the intent to palliative."
1938,Excluded,"The Mayo Clinic gamma knife experience: indications and initial results OBJECTIVE: To review the results and expectations of contemporary stereotactic radiosurgery.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,033 consecutive patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 1990 and January 1998.RESULTS: The number of patients undergoing radiosurgery increased from 57 in 1990 to 216 in 1997. Of 97 patients with arteriovenous malformations who underwent follow-up angiography 2 years or more after a single radiosurgical procedure, 72 (74%) had complete obliteration of the vascular malformation. Of 209 patients who underwent radiosurgery for benign tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, or pituitary adenomas) and had radiologic studies after 2 years or more of follow-up, tumor growth control was noted in 200 (96%). Tumor growth was also controlled in 90% of brain metastatic lesions at a median of 7 months after radiosurgery. Of 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia and follow-up for more than 2 months, 14 (70%) were free of pain after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective management strategy for a wide variety of intracranial disorders. Use of radiosurgical treatment should continue to increase as more data become available on the long-term results of this procedure."

Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice."
2652,Included,"Olfactory testing in staff working in the cardiac catheterization laboratory Background: In the absence of specific protection, invasive cardiologists receive a high lifetime head exposure, with organ doses in the 1 to 3 Sievert range (equivalent to the risk of 50,000 to 150,000 chest x-rays). Radiation exposure in this dose range can reduce neurogenesis in adult brain and negatively impact on olfactory function, whose impairment is a recognized early biomarker of neurode-generative disease. Aim(s): To assess psychological testing results in exposed subjects (ES) working as staff in the Cath Lab compared with non-exposed matched controls (NES). Method(s): A complete olfactory test battery (Sniffin' Sticks Extended test) was performed in 130 Cath Lab ES (60 males; age=44.9+/-8.7 years; 58 interventional cardiologists, 60 nurses, 12 technicians). A control group of age- and gendermatched non-exposed subjects (NES) was also studied. Result(s): ES showed lower scores in the Odor Threshold test (p=.006), Discrimination test (p=.039), Identification test (p=.005) and TDI (the sum of the previous 3 tests, p<.001), as reported in Figure. Subnormal scores of at least 1 of 3 odor subtests were present in 18/130 ES and 7/130 NES (13.8 vs 5.4%, p<.001). Significant correlations were found between Identification Score and years at Cath Lab (r=-.18, p=.012), this last parameter being also correlated with the overall TDI Score (r=-.16, p=.048). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): In ES, olfactory testing showed mild impairment of identification (cortical), discrimination (bulb) and threshold (peripheral) function, somewhat correlated with radiation exposure in the Cath Lab. While further evidence is needed at this point, in the meantime head protection should be a mandatory good practice of safety in every Cath Lab."
1448,Included,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research."

Material(s) and Method(s): Seven patients with malignant glioma, comprising 3 cases with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 3 cases with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 1 case with malignant ependymoma (ME) were included in the study. All patients were pathologically diagnosed and initially treated with adjuvant therapy (radiation and/or ranimustine and/or systemic TNF-SAM2 infusion) following surgical resection. TNF-SAM2 was administrated into the post-operative tumor cavity through a reservoir at a concentration of 1x10<sup>4</sup> U/body when recurrence was detected, or as initial induction therapy concomitant with radiotherapy. Result(s): Partial response to this regional immunotherapy was seen in 4 out of 7 patients, and 1 patient with GBM has remained clinically stable for >184 weeks without tumor progression. With AA, 2 cases appeared to display slowed advance and longer times to tumor recurrence or regrowth. No serious adverse effects, such as brain edema, hemorrhage or seizure were observed, nor systemic toxicities. Conclusion(s): Local immunotherapy with TNF-SAM2 may safely contribute to therapeutic efficacy in some patients with malignant glioma."
303,Excluded,"Radiotherapy for oligometastatic lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically presents at an advanced stage, which is often felt to be incurable, and such patients are usually treated with a palliative approach. Accumulating retrospective and prospective clinical evidence, including a recently completed randomized trial, support the existence of an oligometastatic disease state wherein select individuals with advanced NSCLC may experience historically unprecedented prolonged survival with aggressive local treatments, consisting of radiotherapy and/or surgery, to limited sites of metastatic disease. This is reflected in the most recent AJCC staging subcategorizing metastatic disease into intra-thoracic (M1a), a single extra thoracic site (M1b), and more diffuse metastases (M1c). In the field of radiation oncology, recent technological advances have allowed for the delivery of very high, potentially ablative, doses of radiotherapy to both intra- and extra-cranial disease sites, referred to as stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy (or SABR), in much shorter time periods compared to conventional radiation and with minimal associated toxicity. At the same time, significant improvements in systemic therapy, including platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, molecular agents targeting oncogene-addicted NSCLC, and immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibitors, have led to improved control of micro-metastatic disease and extended survival sparking newfound interest in combining these agents with ablative local therapies to provide additive, and in the case of radiation and immunotherapy, potentially synergistic, effects in order to further improve progression-free and overall survival. Currently, despite the tantalizing potential associated with aggressive local therapy in the setting of oligometastatic NSCLC, well-designed prospective randomized controlled trials sufficiently powered to detect and measure the possible added benefit afforded by this approach are desperately needed.

723,Excluded,"Radiation therapy for glomus tumors of the temporal bone The treatment of glomic tumors has been controversial since its first description. It can be done with surgery, radiotherapy or just expectation. Aim(s): The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of radiotherapy. Study design: clinical with transversal cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): It was made a retrospective review in the charts of the patients with glomus jugulare tumors treated with radiotherapy. Disease control was determined by (1) no progression of symptoms or cranial nerve dysfunction or (2) no progression of the lesion in radiological follow-up. It was also evaluated the follow-up period and the sequelae of the treatment. Result(s): Twelve patients were included, 8 of then women. The follow-up period was from 3 to 35 years, with a media of 11,6 years. The main symptoms were: hearing loss, pulsate tinnitus, dizziness and vertigo. The signs were pulsate retrotympanic mass, facial palsy and cofosis. The tumors were staged using Fisch's classification. The radiotherapy was performed with linear accelerator with dose ranging from 4500-5500 in 4-6 weeks. In the follow-up period were possible to identify sequelaes like dermatitis, meatal stenosis, cofosis and facial palsy. Discussion(s): The signs and symptoms were the same found in the medical literature. The type and dosages of the radiotherapy were also the same of others reports. All patients had improvement of the symptoms and only one was not considered as having disease controlled. Complications were, in general, minor complications, with exception of the cofosis and facial palsy. Conclusion(s): Radiotherapy is a viable alternative to treatment of these tumors because their good response and low level of complications. It should be considered specially in advanced tumors where a surgical procedure could bring a high level of morbidity."
321,Included,"Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) improves learning after radiation stress Brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high utilization of oxygen and rather poorly developed antioxidative defense mechanism. Free radicals formation is greatly augmented during ionizing radiation exposure, which causes damage in cerebellum responsible for locomotor activity. Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) having high content of beta-carotene (about 15 mg/100g), ascorbic acid, Vitamin C and folate, may prove efficient antioxidants. To evaluate its antioxidative efficacy, healthy Swiss albino mice from an inbred colony were selected and divided into three groups having equal number of male and female in each group. All of these animals were initially trained in Hebb William's Maze, model D(1). After initial training of 10 days, two groups were supplemented with methanolic extract of A. paniculatus (Linn.) at a dose of 600 and 800 mg/kg bw per day, respectively for 15 days. One group without any treatment served as normal. It has been observed that mice, supplemented with extract took lesser time to reach goal than normal (without any treatment). Furthermore after supplementation of Amaranthus, followed by exposure to 9 Gy of gamma radiation by 60Co beam therapy unit, the survived mice took lesser time to reach to their goals than those without plant extract. Control mice (not supplemented with AE extract) showed continuous decline in their learning performance. Mice of Control group died within 12 days after exposure. Irradiated males try to recover from 10th day onwards but they died up to day 12. But in Experimental mice (AE treated), after initial decline in learning ability after exposure, recovery was noticed and not only this 70% of them survived beyond the observation period. Besides male mice showed faster learning ability as compared to females in all groups. After irradiation too, males took lesser time to reach to goals. Learning in all the groups before exposure has been much faster in between 9 and 15 days. After radiation, however it was followed by a sudden spurt and delayed learning response up to 12 days. Recovery was greater in males than females in treated groups. Recovery was greater in males of 600 mg/kg bw per day than other groups. Learning has been almost at the same level from 14th day onward, which indicates that both the dose levels have been found equally effective."
1572,Excluded,"Conformational behavior and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in organic solvents: modeling the effects of membranes Intracellular proteinaceous inclusions (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) of alpha-synuclein are pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple systemic atrophy. The molecular mechanisms underlying the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into such filamentous inclusions remain unknown, although many factors have been implicated, including interactions with lipid membranes. To model the effects of membrane fields on alpha-synuclein, we analyzed the structural and fibrillation properties of this protein in mixtures of water with simple and fluorinated alcohols. All solvents that were studied induced folding of alpha-synuclein, with the common first stage being formation of a partially folded intermediate with an enhanced propensity to fibrillate. Protein fibrillation was completely inhibited due to formation of beta-structure-enriched oligomers with high concentrations of methanol, ethanol, and propanol and moderate concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE), or because of the appearance of a highly alpha-helical conformation at high TFE and hexafluoro-2-propanol concentrations. At least to some extent, these conformational effects mimic those observed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, and can explain some of the observed effects of membranes on alpha-synuclein fibrillation."

Little is known regarding prognostic features, clinical characteristics or the impact of treatment on patient (pt) outcomes. Method(s): In this IRB approved retrospective study, our neuro-oncology longitudinal database was screened for pts with GG from 1992-2012. 67 adult pts (age>18) were identified. Result(s): 60 pts presented with low grade GG and 7 with anaplastic GG. The median age at diagnosis was 27 years (18-59). 22 pts developed recurrent disease (18 low grade and 4 high grade) with a median time to recurrence of 87 weeks from surgery. 7 of the pts with low grade GG had malignant transformation to a malignant tumor (anaplastic GG or GBM). 22 pts received radiation therapy, 16 at diagnosis. 14 pts received chemotherapy at recurrence. Pts with incomplete resections or higher grade tumors were more likely to receive chemotherapy or radiation. The median overall survival (OS) time for these pts was not reached with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years. The 2-, 5- and 10-year OS were 98%, 87%, and 76%. Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with OS were KPS at presentation (HR 10.1; 95% CI 2.6, 39.1; p = 0.0008), extent of resection (EOR) (biopsy vs gross total; HR 12.1; 95% CI 2.3, 63.6; p = 0.003), histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs Grade 3-4; HR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01, 0.3; p = 0.0002), and seizure control following surgery (Engel I vs Engel 2-3; HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.01, 0.9; p = 0.02). Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS) were EOR (biopsy vs gross total; HR 4.0; 95% CI 1.4, 11.9; p = 0.01) and histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs .Grade 3-4; HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.08, 0.8; p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, EOR is most significant for PFS (p = 0.01), while tumor grade is most significant for OS (p = 0.004). Conclusion(s): While GG have an excellent prognosis, malignant histological grade, diagnosis with a biopsy only, poor initial KPS, and presence of seizures following surgery could indicate a worse prognosis. The role of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for incompletely resected or inaccessible low grade GG is unclear."
2034,Excluded,"Morphologic comparisons between rhodopsin-mediated and short-wavelength classes of retinal light damage The histologic manifestations of rhodopsin-mediated versus short-wavelength classes of retinal phototoxicity were compared after spectral exposures of the albino rat retina. Animals were exposed to wave-bands of light centered at the peak of rhodopsin absorbance (green, 500 nm) or in the ultraviolet A (UVA; 360 nm). Intensity-damage curves generated for each wave-band indicated that UVA light was 50-80 times more effective than green light at causing photoreceptor cell losses. Examination of early ultrastructural changes in rod inner segments, outer segments, and retinal pigment epithelium revealed a remarkable degree of similarity between UVA and green light-induced damage. Furthermore, the two classes of damage were indistinguishable in terms of post-exposure recovery from threshold damage and regional distribution of photoreceptor cell loss along the vertical meridian. The finding of essentially identical histologic manifestations for the two classes of damage raises the possibility that they share a common biochemical etiology or pathway of cell destruction."

Inhibiting Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in cancers with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has been shown to be a promising approach either as a single agent or in combination therapy with chemotherapeutics or ionizing radiation. To systematically compare the radiosensitizing efficacy of various PARP inhibitors we have evaluated the long-term cytotoxicity of ABT-888, AZD2281, MK4827, and BSI-201 in clonogenic survival assays in combination with ionizing radiation. For these studies we used the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB 231 BR, a subline of MDA-MB-231 selected for its tendency to metastasize to brain (BRCA1+/-) and MX-1 (BRCA1 deletion and BRCA2 mutation). Furthermore, we have evaluated PARP inhibitors under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (21% O2 versus 0.1% O2). In MDA-MB 231 BR cells, at a clinically relevant and achievable concentration for ABT-888 (J Clin Oncol. 2009; 27(16)) and AZD2281(N Engl J Med. 2009; 361(2)), and at 1 uM MK4827 showed radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. BSI-201 at a clinically achievable concentration (ASCO 2010, Abstract 2012) did not exhibit radiosensitizing effects under the same conditions. When MX-1 cells were treated with BSI-201 under hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2) the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was evident. Taken together, the results show that ABT-888, AZD2281 and MK4827 show promising radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions whereas the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was observed only under hypoxic conditions in BRCA1/2 mutant carrier MX-1cells."

Patients received postoperative hypo-IMRT to the surgical cavity and residual tumor seen on T1-weighted brain MRI with a 5-mm margin to a total dose of 60 Gy in 10 fractions (6 Gy/fraction) and to the T2 abnormality on T2-weighted MRI with 5-mm margin to 30 Gy in 10 fractions (3 Gy/fraction). Concurrent TMZ was given at 75 mg/m(2)/day for 28 consecutive days. Adjuvant TMZ was given at 150 to 200 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days every 28 days. Toxicities were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were treated, consisting of 14 men, 10 women; a median age of 60.5 years old (range, 27-77 years); and a median Karnofsky performance score of 80 (range, 60-90). All patients received hypo-IMRT and concurrent TMZ according to protocol, except for 2 patients who received only 14 days of concurrent TMZ. The median number of adjuvant TMZ cycles was 6.5 (range, 0-14). With a median follow-up of 14.8 months (range, 2.7-34.2 months) for all patients and a minimum follow-up of 20.6 months for living patients, no instances of grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity were observed. The median OS was 16.6 months (range, 4.1-35.9 months). Six patients underwent repeated surgery for suspected tumor recurrence; necrosis was found in 50% to 100% of the resected specimens.CONCLUSION: In selected GBM patients, 60 Gy hypo-IMRT delivered in 6-Gy fractions over 2 weeks with concurrent and adjuvant TMZ is safe.

The dose range of X-irradiation was from 1,300 to 2,500 rads, i.e., 1,300, 1,500, 1,750, 2,000, and 2,500 rads. Eighty-six mice were used for histological examination. For microscopic examination, the mice were killed at regular postirradiation intervals between 15 and 20, 31 and 40, 41 and 50, 51 and 60, 61 and 70, 71 and 80, 81 and 90, 139 and 177 weeks. The brains were removed immediately thereafter, fixed in Bouin's solution, and embedded in paraffin. A histological examination was performed by a morphometric estimation of vascular lesions, in which the degree of the damage to the arterial system was scored in whole serial brain sections. Necrosis (encephalomalacia), atrophy, cell infiltration, and telangiectatic vascular change of the brain, caused as a result of the fibrinoid necrosis of the large arteries, were observed. Dose-dependent incidence of the fibrinoid necrosis increased between 41 and 87 weeks after irradiation. Mean score of fibrinoid necrosis increased dose dependently approximately 60 weeks after irradiation. It is suggested that scores of large vessel damage do relate to dose at 41 to 87 weeks, and can be used to quantify the vessel injury, and that fibrinoid necrosis of the large vessels may relate to the incidence of radionecrosis."

These include the sun and, in insects, the polarization pattern of the sky, which depends on the position of the sun. The central complex in the insect brain plays a key role in spatial orientation. In desert locusts, the angle of polarized light in the zenith above the animal and the direction of a simulated sun are represented in a compass-like fashion in the central complex, but how both compasses fit together for a unified representation of external space remained unclear. To address this question, we analyzed the sensitivity of intracellularly recorded central-complex neurons to the angle of polarized light presented from up to 33 positions in the animal's dorsal visual field and injected Neurobiotin tracer for cell identification. Neurons were polarization sensitive in large parts of the virtual sky that in some cells extended to the horizon in all directions. Neurons, moreover, were tuned to spatial patterns of polarization angles that matched the sky polarization pattern of particular sun positions. The horizontal components of these calculated solar positions were topographically encoded in the protocerebral bridge of the central complex covering 360degree of space. This whole-sky polarization compass does not support the earlier reported polarization compass based on stimulation from a small spot above the animal but coincides well with the previously demonstrated direct sun compass based on unpolarized light stimulation. Therefore, direct sunlight and whole-sky polarization complement each other for robust head direction coding in the locust central complex."
1965,Excluded,"Disorder in Pixel-Level Edge Directions on T1WI Is Associated with the Degree of Radiation Necrosis in Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: Preliminary Findings BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (COLLAGE) is a recently developed radiomic (computer extracted) feature that captures entropy (measures the degree of disorder) in pixel-level edge directions and was previously shown to distinguish predominant cerebral radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor on gadolinium-contrast T1WI. In this work, we sought to investigate whether COLLAGE measurements from posttreatment gadolinium-contrast T1WI could distinguish varying extents of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor classes in a lesion across primary and metastatic brain tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: On a total of 75 gadolinium-contrast T1WI studies obtained from patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the extent of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor in every brain lesion was histopathologically defined by an expert neuropathologist as the following: 1) ""pure"" cerebral radiation necrosis; 2) ""mixed"" pathology with coexistence of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumors; 3) ""predominant"" (>80%) cerebral radiation necrosis; 4) predominant (>80%) recurrent tumor; and 5) pure tumor. COLLAGE features were extracted from the expert-annotated ROIs on MR imaging. Statistical comparisons of COLLAGE measurements using first-order statistics were performed across pure, mixed, and predominant pathologies of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: COLLAGE features exhibited decreased skewness for patients with pure (0.15 +/- 0.12) and predominant cerebral radiation necrosis (0.25 +/- 0.09) and were statistically significantly different (P < .05) from those in patients with predominant recurrent tumors, which had highly skewed (0.42 +/- 0.21) COLLAGE values. COLLAGE values for the mixed pathology studies were found to lie between predominant cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor categories.CONCLUSIONS: With additional independent multisite validation, COLLAGE measurements might enable noninvasive characterization of the degree of recurrent tumor or cerebral radiation necrosis in gadolinium-contrast T1WI of posttreatment lesions."

In mice, the hyperdiploid (H2C) P. cells are even more rare. The occurrence of H2C-P. cells in rats and probably also in mice has not been substantially changed in animals exposed to factors interfering with chromatin structure and/or its template activity; the H2C-P. cells seem to be slightly more frequent after injecting mice with corticoids (Urbason) or in animals suffering from ectromelia or hereditary Purkinje cell degeneration. The incidence of H2C-P. cells has neither been substantially affected by experimental conditions which are known to lead to functional and/or metabolic stimulation of the cerebellum. Functional changes in the number of H2C-P. cell nuclei may, however, be short-term or transient in character and therefore might have excaped detection in our models. The findings rule out an impact of some reasons suspected for the artefactual origin of Feulgen H2C DNA values as e.g. compactness of the chromatin."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of PCI in this population.METHODS: We retrospectively identified completely resected SCLC at the Shanghai Chest Hospital between January 2006 and January 2014.RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (115 patients who received PCI [the PCI-treated cohort] and 234 patients who did not [the non-PCI-treated cohort]) were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the PCI-treated cohort had longer overall survival than the non-PCI-treated cohort among patients with pathologic stage (p-stage) II (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.99, p = 0.047) and p-stage III (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86, p = 0.009) disease. Among patients with p-stage III disease, there was a significantly higher risk for cerebral recurrence from the time of diagnosis in the non-PCI-treated cohort (p = 0.018). With regard to patients with p-stage I disease, neither overall survival benefit (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.68-3.83, p = 0.282) nor risk for cerebral recurrence (p = 0.389) was significant between the PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in the current study support using PCI in patients with p-stage II/III disease but not in patients with p-stage I disease. A relatively lower risk for brain metastases in p-stage I patients might explain the inferior efficacy of PCI in this population."

Conversely, these rays were found to have no significant effect on the hepatic prostaglandin F2alpha and to induce, depending on the radiation dose, a reversible or an irreversible decrease in the content of cerebral prostaglandin F2alpha. These results are believed to provide some evidence for a schematic formulation of a mechanism of the radiation induced latent circulatory insufficiency and to elucidate some aspects of the functional interrelations between these prostaglandins, catecholamines, acetylcholine and cyclic AMP after gamma irradiation."

The general living condition and the number and shape of the fungiform papillae and taste buds of the tongues were observed after the radiation in rats.RESULTS: In the group of 60Co radiation, the animals had wilting, decreasing appetite, losing weight. The heads, faces and necks of animals appeared redness, peeling of hair, increasing of secretions in 5 days after the 60Co radiation. The changes reached the summit in 10 days and the general living condition of the animals recovered in 60 days. The fungiform papillae and taste buds of the animals appeared degeneration, atrophy and collapsing in 5 days after the 60Co radiation. The injuries reached the summit in 10-20 days and the fungiform papillae and taste buds regenerated partially, and the some atrophied fungiform papillae and taste buds were not regenerated in 60 days.CONCLUSION: The damage to fungiform papillae and taste buds of tongue following the 60Co radiation with the clinical doses was very serious.

While preclinical research has demonstrated the utility of FUS for efficacious drug deliver to the brain, there remain gaps in our knowledge regarding the long-term response of brain vasculature to this intervention. Previous work has demonstrated transcriptional changes in hippocampal microvessels following sonication that are indicative of the initiation of angiogenic processes. Moreover, blood vessel growth has been reported in skeletal muscle following application of FUS and microbubbles. The current study demonstrates that blood vessel density in the rat hippocampus is modestly elevated at 7 and 14 d post-FUS compared to the contralateral hemisphere (7 d: 10.9 +/- 6.0%, p = 0.02; 14 d: 12.1 +/- 3.2%, p < 0.01), but returns to baseline by 21 d (5.9 +/- 2.6%, p = 0.12). Concurrently, relative newborn endothelial cell density and frequency of small blood vessel segments were both elevated in the sonicated hippocampus. While further work is required to determine the mechanisms driving these changes, the findings presented here may have relevance to the optimal frequency of repeated treatments."
1050,Excluded,"Co-aggregation of ganglioside-containing membranes and alpha-synuclein Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by the formation of Lewy bodies, whose main components are fibrils of the protein alpha-synuclein. These aggregates include membrane lipids, while little is known about the process of lipid/alpha- synuclein co-aggregation and its implications for fibril and Lewy body formation. Ganglioside lipids are abundant in neuronal membranes and have been found to accelerate fibril formation [1] and to accumulate in PD brains. We address the effects of ganglioside-phospholipid (GM3-POPC) model membranes on the dynamics (regarding the order parameter and the correlation time of C-H bond reorientation) and structure of co-aggregates with alpha-synuclein using polarization-transfer 13C solid-state NMR [2], wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and cryogenic electron microscopy. 31P NMR powder patterns were recorded to monitor the lipid phase behavior and the spinning sidebands at 1250 Hz MAS were used to fit the chemical shift anisotropy before and after coaggregation. It was found that both lipids are co-assembled with alpha-synuclein with reduced headgroup and acyl chain mobility, and that the mobility of alpha-synuclein is modulated by the lipid-to-protein ratio and membrane composition. As the ganglioside content of membranes was increased the mobility of alanine residues is affected, implying a modulation of the fibril core which could impact the fibrillation propensity. These effects of co-aggregation on alpha-synuclein fibril mobility are currently being further investigated by us and raises questions on the specific lipid-protein interactions and the organization of lipids inside coaggregates."

762,Excluded,"Extracorporeal bubbles: a word of caution OBJECTIVES: Gaseous microemboli (GME) are a cause of neurocognitive deficit postcardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, the measurement of microbubbles during cardiopulmonary bypass is not easy, because blood is an opaque fluid and contains microparticles. Recently, two new microbubble counters, the Gampt BC200 and the emboli detection and classification (EDAC) quantifier, were developed for use during cardiac surgery. The accuracy of both devices was validated against industrial standards.METHODS: A clear blood analogue (30%/70% glycerol-water) was pumped, by means of a rollerpump out of a partially filled arterial line screen filter with a nominal pore size of 20 microm. Downstream the pump, all test sensors and an optical cuvette, were inserted in a vertically mounted 3/8 inch tubing. Measurements were taken at flows of 405, 1080, 3000 and 6000 ml/min. Backlight shadowgraphy and optical counting were used as industrial reference techniques for measuring size and counts.RESULTS: On average the EDAC quantifier underestimates average bubble diameter by 35+/-1%, 13+/-8%, 71+/-7% and 33+/-4% at 405, 1080, 3000 and 6000 ml/min, respectively. The Gampt BC200 has good sizing agreement at 1080 ml/min (+5+/-17%) and 3000 ml/min (+33+/-6%) but overestimates average diameter by 220+/-40% and 295+/-49% at 405 and 6000 ml/min, respectively. Both devices only partially count the number of microbubbles at higher flows. At 3 l/min the EDAC counts 38%, the Gampt 18% of total counts and at 6 l/min both the EDAC and Gampt only count 3% of total counts.CONCLUSIONS: Both the EDAC and Gampt can be used in a clinical setting for monitoring basal GME production. However, both devices have some major limitations when used for studying 'worst case' scenarios. One should take great caution when correlating measured data with neurocognitive outcome. Finally, results obtained by one device in a first study cannot be compared nor exchanged with results from the other device in a second study."

Neurological examination was normal. Endocrinological examination showed galactorrhea. The patient had a past history of premature menopause. Plain skull films revealed enlargement of sella turcica and CT scan showed sellar tumor with suprasellar expansion which was enhanced by contrast medium. The serum prolactin (PRL) level was 3,290 ng/ml. Diagnosis of PRL secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma) was made. Though surgical removal of the tumor was recommended, it was refused by the patient. Therefore, careful observation was continued as an out-patient until May 1979 when she noticed a temporal hemianopsia of her left eye. She was admitted and had partial removal of the tumor via frontal route and subsequent irradiation (total dose of 5,000 rad by Lineac). The tumor was verified to be a prolactinoma by the immunohistochemical staining. Postoperative course was uneventful and she lead a normal life. In Oct. 1981, severe faceache began and she was readmitted. Sella was destructed extensively and CT scan revealed a hugh sellar tumor with multi-directional extrasellar extension which was less enhanced than that of the first study. The serum PRL level was 588 ng/ml and the regrowth of prolactinoma was suspected. High dose bromocriptine (40 mg/day) therapy was started. The serum PRL level rapidly fell to the negligible value, however, shrinkage of the tumor was not observed. On Jan. 20, 1982, suddenly she developed a left hemiparesis and her level of consciousness gradually deteriorated. On Mar. 11, 1982, the second operation was performed and a solid firm tumor in the base of the skull was partially removed. The tumor was histologically verified to be a fibrosarcoma. After the second operation bromocriptine therapy was discontinued, however expected elevation of the serum PRL level was not recognized. She died on Apr. 4, 1982."
1221,Excluded,"Stochastic growth pattern of untreated human glioblastomas predicts the survival time for patients Glioblastomas are highly malignant brain tumors. Knowledge of growth rates and growth patterns is useful for understanding tumor biology and planning treatment logistics. Based on untreated human glioblastoma data collected in Trondheim, Norway, we first fit the average growth to a Gompertz curve, then find a best fitted white noise term for the growth rate variance. Combining these two fits, we obtain a new type of Gompertz diffusion dynamics, which is a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Newly collected untreated human glioblastoma data in Seattle, US, re-verify our model. Instead of growth curves predicted by deterministic models, our SDE model predicts a band with a center curve as the tumor size average and its width as the tumor size variance over time. Given the glioblastoma size in a patient, our model can predict the patient survival time with a prescribed probability. The survival time is approximately a normal random variable with simple formulas for its mean and variance in terms of tumor sizes. Our model can be applied to studies of tumor treatments. As a demonstration, we numerically investigate different protocols of surgical resection using our model and provide possible theoretical strategies."

We previously have reported that hyperosmotic mannitol-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-D), followed by intracarotid (i.c.) administration of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, significantly enhanced tumor boron delivery and the efficacy of BNCT in F98 glioma bearing rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine the short-term neuropathologic consequences of this treatment and the long-term effects on motor and cognitive function, as well as the neuropathologic sequelae 1 year following neutron capture irradiation. BBB-D was carried out in non-tumor bearing Fischer rats by infusing a 25% solution of mannitol i.c. followed by i.c. injection of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, immediately thereafter. Animals were euthanized 2 days after compound administration, and their brains were processed for neuropathologic examination, which revealed sporadic, mild, focal neuronal degeneration, hemorrhage, and necrosis. To assess the long-term effects of such treatment followed by neutron capture irradiation, non-tumor bearing rats were subjected to BBB-D after which they were injected i.c. with BPA (25 mg B/kg body weight (b.w)) or BSH (30 mg B/kg b.w.) either individually or in combination (BPA 12.5 mg and BSH 14 mg B/kg b.w.). Two and a half hours later they were irradiated at the Medical Research Reactor, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, with the same physical radiation doses (5.79, 8.10 or 10.06 Gy), delivered to the brain, as those that previously had been used for our therapy experiments. The animals tolerated this procedure well, after which they were returned to Columbus, Ohio where their clinical status was monitored weekly. After 1 year, motor function was assessed using a sensitive and reliable locomotor rating scale for open field testing in rats and cognitive function was evaluated by their performance in the Morris water maze, the results of which were similar to those obtained with age matched controls. After functional evaluation, the rats were euthanized, their brains were removed, and then processed for neuropathologic examination. Subtle histopathologic changes were seen in the choroid plexuses of irradiated animals that had received BPA, BSH or saline. Radiation related ocular changes consisting of keratitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and cataract formation were seen with similar frequency in most rats in each treatment group. Based on these observations, and the previously reported significant therapeutic gain associated with BBB-D and i.c. injection of BSH and BPA, the present observations establish its safety in rats and suggest that further studies in large animals and humans are warranted."
765,Excluded,"Cell type-specific hypersensitivity to oxidative damage in CSB and XPA mice Mutations in the CSB gene cause Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare inherited disorder, characterized by UV-sensitivity, severe neurodevelopmental and progeroid symptoms. CSB functions in the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), responsible for the removal of UV-induced and other helix-distorting lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Several lines of evidence support the notion that the CSB TCR defect extends to other non-NER type transcription-blocking lesions, notably various kinds of oxidative damage, which may provide an explanation for part of the severe CS phenotype. We used genetically defined mouse models to examine the relationship between the CSB defect and sensitivity to oxidative damage in different cell types and at the level of the intact organism. The main conclusions are: (1) CSB(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a clear hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, extending the findings in genetically heterogeneous human CSB fibroblasts to another species. (2) CSB(-/-) MEFs are highly sensitive to paraquat, strongly indicating that the increased cytotoxicity is due to oxidative damage. (3) The hypersenstivity is independent of genetic background and directly related to the CSB defect and is not observed in totally NER-deficient XPA MEFs. (4) Wild type embryonic stem (ES) cells display an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation compared to fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the CSB deficiency has only a very minor additional effect on ES cell sensitivity to oxidative damage and is comparable to that of an XPA defect, indicating cell type-specific differences in the contribution of TCR and NER to cellular survival. (5) Similar to ES cells, CSB and XPA mice both display a minor sensitivity to whole-body X-ray exposure. This suggests that the response of an intact organism to radiation is largely determined by the sensitivity of stem cells, rather than differentiated cells. These findings establish the role of transcription-coupled repair in resistance to oxidative damage and reveal a cell- and organ-specific impact of this repair pathway to the clinical phenotype of CS and XP."

The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain."
154,Included,"Postoperative radiation for lung cancer metastatic to the brain PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied."

The mechanisms underlying impairments in cognition are not clear but might involve alterations in the percentage of neurons in the dentate gyrus expressing the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Previously, we showed effects of cranial <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation on hippocampus-dependent contextual freezing and on the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed, but not free, blade. Because it is unclear whether whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation causes similar effects on these markers of hippocampal function, in the present study we quantified the effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation (600MeV, 0.5 or 1Gy) on hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent cognitive performance and determined whether these effects were associated with changes in Arc expression in the enclosed and free blades of the dentate gyrus. Whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation impacted contextual but not cued fear freezing and the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In addition, in mice irradiated with 0.5Gy, contextual freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed blade. In mice tested for cued freezing, there was no correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In contrast, cued freezing in the presence or absence of aversive stimuli correlated with Arc-positive cells in the free blade. In addition, in mice irradiated with 1Gy cued freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive neurons in the free blade. These data indicate that while whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation affects contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, the enclosed blade might be more important for contextual freezing while the free blade might be more important for cued freezing.

1875,Included,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence? Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence."

The pathophysiology of these neurological changes is complex and includes radiation-induced apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We have recently found that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) resulted in significant protection from radiation-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanisms of this cytoprotection include abrogation of radiation-induced accumulation of p53. Here we show that pretreatment of irradiated HT-22 hippocampal-derived neurons with small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3beta SB216763 or SB415286, or with GSK-3beta-specific shRNA resulted in accumulation of the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Knockdown of MDM2 using specific shRNA or chemical inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction prevented the protective changes triggered by GSK-3beta inhibition in irradiated HT-22 neurons and restored radiation cytotoxicity. We found that this could be due to regulation of apoptosis by subcellular localization and interaction of GSK-3beta, p53 and MDM2. These data suggest that the mechanisms of radioprotection by GSK-3beta inhibitors in hippocampal neurons involve regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 accumulation and interactions between GSK-3beta, MDM2 and p53."

Procedure details and time (including duration, radiation exposure, and fluoroscopy) and procedure-related complications were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 155 PED deployment procedures were performed under CS. Treatment was successfully completed in all cases. Anesthesia was converted from CS to general anesthesia during 5 procedures. Mean interval from patient entry at the endovascular suite to procedure initiation was 18 minutes (range, 5 minutes-1 hour 10 minutes). Mean procedure length was 1 hour 25 minutes (range, 30 minutes-3 hours 51 minutes). Mean +/- SD values for fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were 36.17 +/- 18.4 minutes and 1367 +/- 897 mGy, respectively. The mean amount of contrast material administered was 211.37 +/- 83.5 mL. Permanent neurological complications were seen in 4 patients (3%).CONCLUSION: In our experience, CS for PED placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment is feasible and safe.

Healthy right-handed subjects performed finger and hand tapping and a reach-to-grasp movement prior to (baseline) and after 1 Hz rTMS applied over (1) M1 of either the right or the left hemisphere, and (2) the vertex (control stimulation). 1 Hz rTMS applied over the left M1, but not over the vertex, improved movement kinematics of finger and hand tapping as well as grasping with the left hand. 1 Hz rTMS applied over the right M1, but not over the vertex, improved only the kinematics of hand tapping performed with the right hand. These data suggest that 1 Hz rTMS induced inhibition of ipsilateral M1 reduces transcallosal inhibition of contralateral M1 and thereby improves motor performance at the ipsilateral hand. The impact on motor performance of the ipsilateral hand is most pronounced after 1 Hz rTMS over the left M1."
2967,Excluded,"Analyzing the response to metabolic therapy in a mouse model of malignant glioma using multimodality imaging The ketogenic diet (KD) is a therapeutic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that alters metabolism by increasing the level of ketone bodies in the blood. We have used a bioluminescent intracranial mouse model of malignant glioma and the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, a PerkinElmer Co, Hopkinton, MA) to demonstrate that a rodent ketogenic diet given ad libitum increases blood ketones without altering animal weight or overall blood glucose levels. Animals maintained on a KD have extended survival following tumor implantation, and the KD potentiates the therapeutic effects of radiation and chemotherapy. We previously demonstrated in vivo that these tumors cause a local increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the KD reduced ROS in the tumor when quantitatively analyzed ex vivo. We now hypothesize that ketosis, which is known to have a neuroprotective effect in various diseases, may also reduce peritumoral edema and/or inflammation. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is a known mediator of inflammation, and expression profiling analysis showed that animals maintained on a SD have a significant increase in expression of the gene encoding COX-2 in their tumor, while animals maintained on KD showed no such increase. MRI analyses using a Bruker Biospec 70/30 MRI (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Freemont, CA) showed that animals fed KD also have a significant reduction in peritumoral edema. We previously demonstrated that commercially available fluorescent probes such as AngioSense 680 EX (PerkinElmer, Inc.) can be used in concert with in vivo imaging of tumor bioluminescence to demonstrate vascular permeability that can lead to increased peritumoral edema. We are now using the XenoLight RediJect COX-2 fluorescent probe (PerkinElmer, Inc) and the AngioSense 680 EX fluorescent probe in combination with the bioluminescent indication of tumor size and MRI analyses of tumor size and peritumoral edema. Co-registration of these images will be done using a mouse imaging shuttle and multi-modality software module (Caliper Life Sciences), thus facilitating in vivo analysis of the mechanisms of action of the KD on tumor gene expression and growth."
114,Excluded,"Prevalence, predictors, and characteristics of off-treatment fatigue in breast cancer survivors BACKGROUND: Lack of consensus regarding how to identify cancer patients with significant fatigue has hampered research regarding cancer-related fatigue (CRF).METHODS: Specific criteria were used to identify CRF cases in women with stage 0-II breast cancer (BC group, n = 304). Women completed assessments before adjuvant therapy (baseline), end of adjuvant therapy (Post-Tx), and 6 and 42 months after end of adjuvant therapy (6 and 42 Month Post-Tx). At each, women completed a clinical interview and questionnaires assessing physical and mental health. A healthy control (HC) group with no history of BC (n = 337) completed 2 similar assessments 36 months apart.RESULTS: Off-treatment CRF prevalence was 9% and 13% at the 6 and 42 Month Post-Tx assessments, respectively. Thus, 15% of the sample evidenced off-treatment CRF with 7% evidencing delayed onset CRF. CRF at the 6 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated only with CRF at baseline (OR = 3.2) and Post-Tx assessments (OR = 3.9). CRF at the 42 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated with CRF at the Post-Tx assessment (OR = 6.1), obesity at baseline, and several baseline measures of coping in response to fatigue. Off-treatment CRF cases differed markedly from CRF noncases and healthy controls on a spectrum of health status indices (mean effect size >1.0 SD).CONCLUSIONS: Results document the prevalence of off-treatment and delayed onset CRF, suggest the utility of a cognitive-behavioral model of CRF, and support NCCN guidelines recommending monitoring fatigue across the cancer trajectory."

[French] Gamma Knife treatments of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are performed for about 40 years. This article presents the results of 123 patients treated for a brain AVM at the Gamma Knife Center ULB-Hopital Erasme. Radiosurgical treatment is proposed following multidisciplinary discussion of the best therapeutic strategy based on specific parameters of the AVM. Gamma Knife irradiation was achieved for an AVM residue after endovascular embolization for 84 % of patients, after microsurgery for 7 % of patients, or after previous radiosurgical irradiation for 6 % of patients. The whole volume of the nidus was irradiated in a single session for all patients. A mean margin dose of 22.3 Gy was delivered to the nidus, which had a mean volume of 3.3 cc. The maximum dose ranged from 30 Gy to 50 Gy (mean 44.1 Gy). All patients were prospectively followed after treatment with serial angio-MR and/or conventional angiography. A retrospective analysis shows complete obliteration of the AVM for 109 patients (89 %) after 6 to 52 months (mean 32 months). For 14 patients the nidus was only partially obliterated from the radiosurgical procedure; for 9 patients a second irradiation was performed with subsequent complete occlusion of the AVM in all cases. So, 118 of 123 patients (96 %) irradiated by Gamma Knife in 1 or 2 sessions were cured. Four patients bled after irradiation and before complete occlusion of the AVM, with neurological deficit for 2 patients. Transient neurological symptoms develop after treatment for 12 patients (10 %), associated with postradic edema treated with corticoids. Permanent neurological worsening occurred in5 patients (4 %). Gamma Knife treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations is a highly efficient and low-risk therapy when used by a multidisciplinary team."
1594,Included,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes."

We examined nonvisual photoreception in mice lacking RPE65, a protein that is required for regeneration of visual chromophore in rods and cones. Although Rpe65 knockouts retain a small degree of rod function, we show here that circadian phase shifting responses in Rpe65(-/-) mice are attenuated far beyond what has been reported for rodless/coneless mice. Furthermore, the number of melanopsin-immunoreactive perikarya and the extent of dendritic arborizations were decreased in Rpe65 knockout mice compared with controls. To assess the nature of the photoreceptive defect in Rpe65 null mice, we eliminated either rods or melanopsin from Rpe65(-/-) retinas by generating (i) Rpe65(-/-) mice carrying a transgene (rdta) that results in selective elimination of rods and (ii) double knockout Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, rod loss in Rpe65 knockout mice resulted in restoration of circadian photosensitivity. Normal photoentrainment was lost in Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice, and, instead, a diurnal phenotype was observed. Our findings demonstrate that RPE65 is not required for ipRGC function but reveal the existence of a mechanism whereby rods may influence the function of ipRGCs."
75,Excluded,"Interstitial irradiation of brain metastases Randomized studies have shown that survival in patients with single brain metastases is significantly higher after the combined treatment of surgical removal and whole-brain irradiation than after whole-brain radiation therapy alone. In patients with deep-seated lesions or those located in critical sites of the brain, as well as in cases in which the patient's general condition makes general anaesthesia difficult or impossible microsurgical resection usually cannot be performed or only with an increased surgical risk. Stereotactic radiosurgery, which can be done by means of convergent beam irradiation or by the implantation of highly loaded 125I seeds, provides an alternative to open procedures. In the following we report on our results using a stereotactic radiosurgical technique. A series of 20 treatments is presented, in which biopsy was performed and 125I seeds were implanted, both under stereotactic conditions in the same session. The 125I seeds were sealed in a teflon catheter, were left indwelling temporarily, and then removed after application of the prescribed radiation dose (6,000cGy at the tumour margin). There was only one recurrence in our series, complications occurred in only one patient by temporary aggravation of a pre-existing hemiparesis. Our results indicate that interstitial irradiation of brain metastases is a valuable, less stressful alternative to both open microsurgery as well as to stereotactic radiosurgical convergent beam irradiation."
1775,Included,"Alteration of Interneuron Immunoreactivity and Autophagic Activity in Rat Hippocampus after Single High-Dose Whole-Brain Irradiation The effects of high dose gamma radiation on brain tissue are poorly understood, with both limited and major changes reported. The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation."

One technique poised to take advantage of these developments is optical spectroscopy (OS). All optical spectroscopic techniques have in common tissue interrogation with light sources ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) ranges of the spectrum, and collection of information on light reflected (reflectance spectroscopy) or light interactions with tissue and emergence at different wavelengths (fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy). OS can provide information regarding intrinsic tissue optical properties such as tissue structure, nuclear density, and the presence or absence of endogenous or exogenous fluorophores. Among other applications, this information has been used to distinguish tumor from normal brain tissues, to detect tumor margins in intrinsic, infiltrating gliomas, to identify radiation damage to tissues, and to assess tissue viability and predict the onset of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Potential applications of OS include detection of specific central nervous system (CNS) structures, such as brain nuclei, identification of cell types by the presence of specific neurotransmitters, and the detection of optically labeled cells or drugs during therapeutic interventions. All have potential utility in neuro-oncology, have been investigated in our laboratories, and will be the subject of this review. [References: 33]"
2832,Excluded,"Hyperthermia promotes c-myc turnover and reduces ODC expression in colorectal cancer cells Hyperthermia therapy is an FDA-approved procedure that is used to improve the clinical response to radiation and chemotherapy in a variety of solid malignancies. This method involves raising the temperature of tumor-bearing tissues to 41-43degreeC, which is commonly achieved by using microwave or radiofrequency (RF)-emitting devices. Despite a multitude of treatment centers that are now providing this type of therapy, the cellular and molecular processes are not fully understood. Here, we report that that the oncogenic transcription factor, c-myc has a potentially important role in the anti-cancer mechanism of hyperthermia. By treating colorectal cancer cells (RKO cell line) with heat (incubation at 42degreeC), we observe a rapid decrease in c-myc levels that is not seen with other transcription factors. We have also observed a similar effect in other cell types, including lung (A549) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y). It is already known that the turnover of c-myc protein is enhanced by phosphorylation at Thr58. Our Western blot data reveal that hyperthermia causes a significant increase in Thr58 phosphorylation, which is accompanied by a reduction in total c-myc levels. c-Myc is frequently deregulated in human cancers, where it promotes the expression of genes that drive tumor cell proliferation. To assess the role of c-myc target genes in the response to hyperthermia, we looked at one such target gene, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis. We see that the hyperthermia-induced degradation of c-myc is accompanied by a drastic reduction in ODC mRNA and protein levels. Using actinomycin D, we observe that heat has no effect on ODC mRNA stability, suggesting that the decrease in ODC is due to a reduction in gene transcription. In support of this, we find that silencing c-myc expression with siRNA inhibits ODC mRNA and protein levels by a similar amount as hyperthermia. We propose that the down-regulation of ODC caused by c-myc degradation may be an important part of the clinical response to hyperthermia, and future work will evaluate the effect of heat on cellular polyamine levels."

Seventy-two rats were used in six independent experiments, three of which were done with 900 MHz and the other three with 1800 MHz. The exposures were performed in a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic mode (GTEM) cell. The power densities of radiation were 100 and 20 microW/cm(2) at 900 and 1800 MHz frequency, respectively. The carrier frequency was modulated with 218 Hz, as in the GSM signal. The animals were exposed for 2 h between 8:00 AM and noon daily during the 14 day exposure period. The urine of rats was collected from 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM, collecting from exposed and control animal groups on alternate days. The urinary 6SM concentration was measured by (125)I radioimmunoassay and was referred to creatinine.

1941,Excluded,A comparison between the distinct inward currents activated in rat cultured dorsal root ganglion neurones by intracellular flash photolysis of two forms of caged cyclic guanosine monophosphate Whole cell inward currents activated by intracellular photorelease of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were investigated in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones. The actions of two distinct types of caged cGMP (NPE-caged cGMP and a highly water-soluble caged cGMP) were compared. Rapidly activating inward currents were evoked by cGMP in a subpopulation (12.5%) of neurones and these currents may be due to activity of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. In contrast in 52% of DRG neurones intracellular photorelease of cGMP activated a delayed Ca(2+)-dependent inward current through the generation of cyclic ADPribose and mobilisation of Ca(2+) from ryanodine sensitive intracellular stores. Similar delayed inward currents were activated by both caged compounds but only NPE-caged cGMP evoked rapidly activating currents. Cyclic GMP appears to increase excitability in some DRG neurones by diverse mechanisms.

1550,Included,"Transmission of signals between irradiated and non-irradiated organisms: Mechanisms and significance Inter-animal signaling from irradiated to non-irradiated organisms has been demonstrated for whole body irradiated mice and also for fish. Endpoints studied include clastogenic damage, and reproductive cell death. For fish, proteomic data has also been produced showing the induction of a protective proteome in both medaka and rainbow trout. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients."

Calculation of rCBF was performed using the 2-weighted integral (WI) and autoradiographic methods for the 1-compartment analysis, and the 3-WI method was followed for the 2-compartment analysis. Arterial blood radioactivity was counted continuously and corrected for delay and dispersion. The rCBF images were transformed into the Talairach space and analyzed by statistical parametric mapping to identify regional differences in the 2 methods. The values obtained from regions of interest also were compared.RESULTS: Although the difference in global CBF between the 2 models was not significant, rCBF values in the large arteries and neighbor areas were significantly greater in the 2-WI method than in the 3-WI method. However, regional differences in the activation studies were not affected when the 2 methods were compared. The images of cerebral arterial blood volume (V(0)) obtained by the 3-WI method showed a significant increase in V(0) in the visual cortex during visual stimulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the rCBF values in the 1-compartment analysis were affected by radioactivity in the vessels. The 3-WI method could provide rCBF values that are less influenced by vascular radioactivity and also show differences in V(0) in PET activation studies."

Pituitary adenoma radiosurgery (RS) is a second intention therapeutic method. It should be recommended only after failure of medical and/or surgical treatment. Two main methods can be used: linear accelerator-radiosurgery and Cobalt-60 gamma unit. Both procedures provide equivalent results in terms of dosimetry, accuracy and clinical data. Results of various series presented in recent and updated literature have been studied and analysed. They show and confirm the efficiency of radiosurgery on tumor and hormone secretion controls, with few cases of pituitary insufficiency. However, results were disappointing concerning visual disorders, particularly if visual dysfunction and impairment existed before radiosurgery. All authors agree nowadays on different points: a) indications: invasive adenomas, with an incomplete resection, or adenomatous recurrences, b) contraindications: tumoral size > 20 mm, distance to visual pathways < 5 mm, c) imperative precautionary measures: less than 8 Gray must be delivered on visual pathways, less than 40 Gray on oculomotor nerves.

Compared to preflight, Astronaut A showed reduced OCR immediately postflight, which increased over the next few days. Both Astronauts B and C had increased OCR postflight, which gradually approached but did not achieve the preflight values over 13 days postflight.

However, nonsynaptic epileptiform activity induced in vitro is known to propagate slowly from the caudal end of CA1 toward CA2/CA3. Understanding the propagation modes of epileptiform activity, and their causality is important to revealing the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and developing new treatments. In this paper, the effect of the synaptic transmission suppression on the propagation of epilepsy in vivo was investigated by using multiple-channel recording probes in CA1. Nonsynaptic epileptiform activity was induced by calcium chelator EGTA with varied concentrations of potassium. For comparison, disinhibition synaptic epileptiform activity was induced by picrotoxin (PTX) with or without partial suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission. The propagation velocity was calculated by measuring the time delay between two electrodes separated by a known distance. The results show that in vivo nonsynaptic epileptiform activity propagates with a direction and velocity comparable to those observed in in vitro preparations. The direction of propagation for nonsynaptic activity is reversed from the PTX-induced synaptic activity. A reversal in propagation direction and change in velocity were also observed dynamically during the process of synaptic transmission suppression. Even a partial suppression of synaptic transmission was sufficient to significantly change the propagation direction and velocity of epileptiform activity. These results suggest the possibility that the measurement of propagation can provide important information about the synaptic mechanism underlying epileptic activity."

High-dose whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was once the primary treatment, but eventual relapses and late neurocognitive sequelae were frequently observed. The addition of CNS-directed chemotherapy to WBRT improved duration of response, with a concomitant increase in neurocognitive problems. More recently, medical oncologists have attempted to avoid radiation altogether, with similar clinical responses as seen with WBRT alone. The addition of rituximab has yielded little improvement due to the poor efficiency (<1%) of the antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). WBRT has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB permeability to macromolecules for several hours.We hypothesized that adjuvant low-dose WBRT followed by anti-CD20-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT) may allow for specific dose escalation to areas of tumor cells while avoiding extra dose to uninvolved areas of the brain, decreasing the chance for significant neurocognitive deficits. Materials/Methods: Four patients (71F, 69M, 48F, 53M) with PCNSL (3 relapsed, 1 newly diagnosed) were treated with low-dose (18 Gy in 10 fractions) WBRT,with 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan RIT given immediately after the final WBRT fraction. None of the patients had previously received radiation therapy.Median RIT dosewas 24.5 (21.8-32) mCi. All patients were restaged with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain at 3 months, and every 3 months following. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, neurocognition was tested and family members were asked about subjective changes. Result(s): All four patients obtained a complete response to chemotherapy + low-dose WBRT + RIT. After a median follow-up of 17.5 (12-20) months, no relapses have been observed. No decline in neurocognitive function (objective or subjective) has been seen; in fact, improvement was seen in 3 patients. All patients tolerated the regimen well, with the typical transient decline and recovery of blood counts seen with RIT. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant low-dose WBRT and RIT following CNS-directed chemotherapy appears to be safe in this small sample. Complete responses were seen in all patients, and this appears to be durable compared to standard PCNSL salvage therapies. No neurocognitive deficits were seen following this novel radiation therapy regimen. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."
807,Excluded,"Volumetric modulated arc therapy for delivery of head and neck radiotherapy: Comparison between constant and variable dose rate Purpose: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a form of intensity modulated radiotherapy that allows the radiation dose to be delivered during continuous gantry rotation, using either a constant dose rate (CDR) or variable dose rate (VDR). The aim of this work was to compare these two techniques for delivery of head and neck (HN) radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): VDR and CDR plans were created for 15 patients with various types of HN cancer. For each patient, 3 PTVs were defined with prescribed doses of 66 Gy, 60 Gy and 54 Gy for 30 fractions. OARs included mandible (MA), spinal cord (SC), brain stem (BS), parotids (PA), salivary glands (SG), esophagus (ES), larynx (LA) and thyroid (TH). For both CDR and VDR two 6 MV arcs (182degree-178degree; clockwise and counterclockwise directions; final arc spacing 4degree, collimator angle 45degree) were used. All plans were performed with Pinnacle3 TPS (v 9.8) according to an internal protocol; it was required that PTVs D95% be 95% of the prescribed dose and OARs be spared as more as possible. Dose distributions were compared by evaluating PTVs' Dmean, D2%, D50%, D98% and homogeneity index (HI). For MA, SC, BS the analysis included D2%; for PA, SG, ES, LA and TH Dmean and a number of different dosevolume data in the range V20Gy-V50Gy were compared. To compare CDR and VDR, monitor unit (MU) and treatment delivery time (TDT) were also evaluated. Result(s): About PTV coverage, no statistically significant differences were found. For OARs, VDR showed a reduction in LA and ES Dmean, V20Gy and V30Gy, in TH Dmean, V45Gy and V50Gy and Dmean for PA and SG, but differences were always within 1.5 Gy and all constraints were respected. No significant differences were found in D2% for MA, SC and BS. TDT and MU were lower for CDR, on average 20 sec and 50 MU respectively. Conclusion(s): Our study showed that CDR offers levels of quality comparable to VDR and a valid option of rotational arc radiotherapy for linacs without variable dose rate."

The prognostic value of radiographic ENE (rENE) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV + OPX) is uncertain. Method(s): Patients with HPV + OPX with adequate pretreatment radiographic nodal evaluation from a single institution were analyzed. rENE status was determined by neuroradiologists' at time of diagnosis. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess the impact of rENE on survival endpoints. Result(s): Hundred sixty-eight patients with OPX + squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed between April 2008 and December 2014 were included for analysis with median follow-up of 3.3 years. Eighty-eight percent of patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. rENE was not prognostic; its presence in patients with HPV + OPX did not significantly impact OS, LRFS, or DMFS.

3063,Excluded,"Light-induced hormone conversion of T4 to T3 regulates photoperiodic response of gonads in birds Reproduction of many temperate zone birds is under photoperiodic control. The Japanese quail is an excellent model for studying the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement because of its distinct and marked response to changing photoperiods. Studies on this animal have suggested that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is an important centre controlling photoperiodic time measurement. Here we report that expression in the MBH of the gene encoding type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), which catalyses the intracellular deiodination of thyroxine (T4) prohormone to the active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), is induced by light in Japanese quail. Intracerebroventricular administration of T3 mimics the photoperiodic response, whereas the Dio2 inhibitor iopanoic acid prevents gonadal growth. These findings demonstrate that light-induced Dio2 expression in the MBH may be involved in the photoperiodic response of gonads in Japanese quail."

2055,Excluded,"Impact of cellular localization of survivin on the resistance of glioblastoma cells againstthe monoalkylating anticancer drugs Question: Despite constant progress in medical care, brain tumors WHO grade IV (Glioblastoma multiforme) remain incurable. In the last decade, survivin, an inhibitor of the apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, was shown to be a promising target, as it is selectively expressed in tumors and its expression correlates with the grade of malignancy and therapy response. Besides being an anti-apoptotic factor, survivin plays a role during chromosome segregation in mitosis. It passively penetrates into the nucleus but is actively exported out of the nucleus through its C-terminal nuclear export sequence (NES). Since nuclear accumulation of survivin was observed upon exposure to ionizing radiation, where survivin seems to support DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, the question arises whether also alkylation-induced DSBs impact survivin localization and how this affects DNA repair, cell cycle, clastogenicity and cellular survival. Method(s): DNA cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, transfection and generation of stable clones, immunofluorescence, colony-forming assays, flow cytometric cell death assays, western blot analysis, Co-IP/ interactome analysis, chromosomal aberration assays. Result(s): To answer the questions, we generated glioblastoma cell clones stably expressing either a GFP-survivin or a NES-mutated GFP-survivin fusion protein (GFPNESmut-survivin). In colony-forming assays, we observed that cell clones with strong GFP-survivin expression were mostly protected against temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line monoalkylating drug, whereas clones expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin were most sensitive. We also observed that GFP-survivin was efficiently exported out of the nucleus, whereas the mutated GFP-survivin retained in the nucleus and even accumulated during the time course of TMZ exposure. Neither of GFP-survivin variants co-localized with yH2AXfoci, but interestingly, cells expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin showed significantly more TMZ-induced yH2AX foci as compared to GFP-survivin expressing cells. This correlates with the observed overall survival after exposure to the drug. Coimmunoprecipitation in nuclear extracts of TMZ-exposed cells using survivin as bait revealed its potential specific interactors. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that only survivin localized in the nucleus renders glioblastoma cells hypersensitive to TMZ, which stresses nuclear survivin to be a beneficial prognostic marker and supports the use of nuclear export inhibitors as adjuvant drugs."
2226,Excluded,"Pseudoprogression following chemoradiotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme PURPOSE: Pseudoprogression (psPD) is now recognised following radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of psPD following RT/TMZ and the effect of psPD on prognosis.MATERIALS/METHODS: All patients receiving RT/TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a prospective database. Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis. Maintenance TMZ should not be abandoned on the basis of seemingly discouraging imaging features identified within the first three months after RT/TMZ."

225,Included,"Distinct response of adult neural stem cells to low versus high dose ionising radiation Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50-500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation."
1809,Excluded,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report) Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC."
2001,Included,"Molecular events associated with increased regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells following X-irradiation: decreased level of axonal growth inhibitors In our previous work we established conditions to study the contribution of non-neuronal cells to the process of goldfish optic nerve regeneration. This issue has been studied successfully by adapting the use of X-irradiation to manipulate division of non-neuronal cells associated with the injured nerve. The regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells was determined subsequent to the X-ray treatment. In this work we present an analysis of the molecular events associated with regeneration and enhanced regenerative capacity which follows X-irradiation. Under normal conditions the non-neuronal cells surrounding an intact nerve released axonal growth inhibitors, the level of which was only slightly sensitive to X-irradiation. In contrast, regenerating nerves showed a marked decrease in substances having an inhibitory effect on sprouting in vitro. Moreover, their level was significantly reduced following X-irradiation which was accompanied by increased accumulation of fibrous collagen adjacent to astrocytes. The alteration in the reciprocal relationship between the axon and the surrounding non-neuronal cells was also manifested by changes in the profile of labeled proteins released by the non-neuronal cells. The results of this work, therefore, indicate the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the environment provided by the cells surrounding the regenerating fibers and thus may open a new perspective relating to the capacity of neurons to regenerate."
2982,Excluded,"Radiation exposure during transmission measurements: comparison between CT- and germanium-based techniques with a current PET scanner In positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning, transmission measurements for attenuation correction are commonly performed by using external germanium-68 rod sources. Recently, combined PET and computed tomographic (CT) scanners have been developed in which the CT data can be used for both anatomical-metabolic image formation and attenuation correction of the PET data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference between germanium- and CT-based transmission scanning in terms of their radiation doses by using the same measurement technique and to compare the doses that patients receive during brain, cardiac and whole-body scans. Measurement of absorbed doses to organs was conducted by using a Rando Alderson phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Effective doses were calculated according to the guidelines in the International Commission on Radiation Protection Publication Number 60. Compared with radionuclide doses used in routine 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET imaging, doses absorbed during germanium-based transmission scans were almost negligible. On the other hand, absorbed doses from CT-based transmission scans were significantly higher, particularly with a whole-body scanning protocol. Effective doses were 8.81 mSv in the high-speed mode and 18.97 mSv in the high-quality mode for whole-body CT-based transmission scans. These measurements revealed that the doses received by a patient during CT-based transmission scanning are more than those received in a typical PET examination. Therefore, the radiation doses represent a limitation to the generalised use of CT-based transmission measurements with current PET/CT scanner systems."
573,Excluded,"Phase 1/2 study of dianhydrogalactitol (VAL-083) with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, mgmt-unmethylated glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer. Current standard-of-care includes surgery followed by chemoradiation and temozolomide. An unmethylated promoter for O6-methylguanine- DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is a validated biomarker for temozolomide-resistance and is strongly correlated with poor outcomes. Unmethylated MGMT represents the majority of newly diagnosed GBM tumors. VAL-083 is a first-in-class bi-functional DNA-targeting agent that has shown activity against GBM in NCI-sponsored clinical trials both as single agent and in combination with radiotherapy. VAL-083 induces interstrand cross-links at N7-guanine, leading to DNA double-strand breaks and cell-death. VAL-083s unique mechanism-of-action circumvents MGMT-mediated chemoresistance, and it has demonstrated cytotoxicity in MGMT-unmethylated GBM cell-lines, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in vivo models. Furthermore, VAL-083 acts as a radiosensitizer in GBM CSCs and non-CSCs. We completed a dose-escalation trial of VAL-083 in recurrent GBM, and a generally well-tolerated dosing regimen was selected for further clinical development. The present trial is an ongoing open-label, biomarker-driven, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed MGMTunmethylated GBM patients. A treatment regimen, consisting of a 6-week induction period of VAL-083 and concurrent radiation (2 Gy daily, 5 days/ week) followed by up to 24 weeks of maintenance therapy with singleagent VAL-083, is being evaluated. The study is being conducted in two parts: 1) a dose-escalation part (20, 30, and 40mg/m2/day IV infusion on days 1,2,3 of a 21-day cycle) in up to 10 patients; 2) an expansion part in up to 20 additional patients at the determined well-tolerated dose.

Interpret the different laboratory studies for diagnosing syphilis. CASE: A 28-year old woman presented with one week of a deep aching pain in her right eye with radiation to the back of her head. The pain was exacerbated with eye movements. She also described blurred vision in the right eye over the same time period. She had a history of migraine headaches, traumatic C4 fracture three years ago and hypertension. Physical examination demonstrated visual acuity of 20/100 in the right and 20/ 20 in the left eye. Extra-ocular movements were intact but painful. Slit lamp examination revealed mild periorbital edema and 2+ conjunctiva and scleral injection on the right. Dilated fundus exam noted mild blurring of the disk margin nasally. Initial laboratory studies noted normal electrolytes, a negative rapidHIV, and a normal uric acid level. B scan ultrasonographywas notable for posterior scleral thickening, lateral greater than medial, which was confirmed by CT scan of the orbits. She was sent home with a one-week course of prednisone and ibuprofen with a presumptive diagnosis of scleritis. Further serologieswere pending. Initially, she had relief frompain and improved vision while treated with prednisone and ibuprofen. However, two weeks later these symptoms had returned. Her RPR was 1:16; treponomal pallidum partial agglutination was reactive. Her ANA was 1:80 with a speckled pattern. She was admitted for lumbar puncture and treatment of neurosyphilis with Penicillin G Benzathine. CSF revealed VDRL was non-reactive and a lymphocytic pleocytosis was noted on the cell count. DISCUSSION: Despite a minor decrease in syphilis rates in the United States, syphilis continues to be a disease encountered by the general internist. Recognizing the uncommon manifestations of syphilis not only improves the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis, but also other sexually transmitted infections. Syphilitic-related eye disease can occur at any stage and presents in a variety of ways. Ocular manifestations include chancres of the eyelid and conjunctiva, blepharitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, Argyll Robinson pupil, madarosis, neuroretinitis, and uveitis. Though data is limited, uveitis may be the most common ocular presentation in patients infected with HIV. In patients with HIV, the presentation is often bilateral, more severe, and frequently involves the posterior segment of the eye. There does not appear to be a correlation between CD4 count and the presence of ocular involvement. Ocular syphilis is treated as neurosyphilis and therefore must be treated with intravenous penicillin G. A diagnosis of ocular syphilis is made with non-treponemal tests such as an RPR or VRDL, measuring IgM and IgG to anticardiolipin cholesterol lecithin antigens. This is confirmed with a direct treponemal test such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody test (FTABS) or the microhemagglutination assay that measures antibodies to treponemal cellular components. A positive CSF VDRL or a lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF fluid is also confirmatory. The need for CSF analysis is debated as treatment does not change, but should probably be done, especially in patients with HIV."

In addition, the probable effects of radiotherapy on the activities of antioxidant enzymes and levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the plasma were investigated as well. The effects of melatonin treatment on radiotherapy-based central nervous system (CNS) damage were also studied. For this purpose, the rats were randomized into four groups. The first group was the control group (sham-exposed group), the second group received only melatonin, the third group was irradiated and the fourth group received both melatonin and irradiation. Plasma samples of rats were collected for measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the levels of NO. 24 h after the interventions, tissue samples were obtained from the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex for the light microscopic investigations. These tissues were mostly affected by radiation. The results indicated that the application of radiation significantly enhanced the levels of plasma SOD and NO. On the other hand, melatonin pretreatment prevented the decrease in plasma CAT activity induced by irradiation. It was found that the application of melatonin could significantly prevent the irradiation-induced damages. Light microscopic results revealed that the damage of the CNS by radiation was prevented by the application of melatonin."
1113,Excluded,"Circulating tumor cells with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition are associated with distant metastatic failures in lung cancer patients treated with definitive chemoradiation Purpose/Objective(s): Preclinical studies suggest that radiation can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance matrix invasion in several tumor types. To assess if this occurs clinically, we analyzed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for EMT markers (EMT-CTC) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiation. Materials/Methods: This prospective study enrolled 22 patients between April 2011 and May 2012. The primary endpoint was distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. None had induction chemotherapy. One patient had hypofractionated protons without chemotherapy. Serial blood samples (20 mL) were drawn at baseline (pretreatment), twice during treatment, and once at first follow-up. One tube of blood (10 mL) was sent to enumerate cytokeratin (CK)-positive/CD45-negative cells (HD-CTCs) using an automated microscopic image analysis system. A second tube was analyzed using the StemDx assay, a quantitative PCR-based assay to detect transcripts of EMT markers (SNAIL, TWIST, TG2, and CMET) on CTC in peripheral blood samples depleted of CD326/EpCAM+ CTC and CD45+ leukocytes by antibody coated magnetic beads. DMFS time was counted from date of first blood draw to the DM or death or last contact. Deaths without DM on the date of last contact were counted as events. Due to the small sample size, all times to event were subjected to univariable analysis using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the comparisons of distributions between groups were made using the log-rank test. Result(s): Patients had either stage 3A/B (n = 16), oligometastatic stage 4 (bone or brain) (n=2), or localized recurrent or positive margin disease after surgery that was amendable for definitive treatment (n = 4). The median follow-up for all patients from the time of first blood draw to the last contact date or death was 9.5 months, and for living patients was 11.1 months. At last follow-up, 8 had died, 8 progressed with DM, and 2 had in-field local relapse. Using the Epic Sciences assay,DMFSwas significantly associated with>=10 HD-CTCs/mL of blood (p = 0.036). The presence of CMET or SNAIL transcripts on CTC by StemDx also significantly predicted for both DMFS (p= 0.036) and recurrence of any type (p =0.02). Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we found an association between DMFS and either >= 10 HD-CTC/mL of blood or EMT markers CMET or SNAIL in NSCLC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation. While these data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients, EMT-CTCs may reflect metastatic burden as seen in some of the patients with elevated HD-CTC counts, and may be valuable biomarkers to risk stratify patients after definitive chemoradiation."

A 12-mm section of the cervical spinal cord (T2-C2) of 5-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats was locally irradiated with a single dose of 22 Gy of (60)Co gamma rays. This dose is known to produce myelopathy in all animals within 6 months of irradiation. After irradiation, the animals were subdivided into three groups, and at 90 days after irradiation, neural stem cells or saline (for controls) were injected into the spinal cord, intramedullary, at two sites positioned 6 mm apart on either side of the center of the irradiated length of spinal cord. The injection volume was 2 microl. Group I received a suspension of MHP36 cells, Group II MHP15 cells, and Group III (controls) two injections of 2 microl saline. All rats received 10 mg/kg cyclosporin (10 mg/ml) daily i.p. to produce immunosuppression. All animals that received saline (Group III) developed paralysis within 167 days of irradiation. The paralysis-free survival rates of rats that received transplanted MHP36 and MHP15 cells (Groups I and II) were 36.4% and 32% at 183 days, respectively. It was concluded that transplantation of neural stem cells 90 days after irradiation significantly (P = 0.03) ameliorated the expression of radiation-induced myelopathy in the spinal cords of rats."
924,Excluded,"Effects of pulsed versus conventional radiofrequency current on rabbit dorsal root ganglion morphology Lesioning using radiofrequency (RF) current has been increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pain syndromes. Although formation of heat causing ""thermocoagulation"" of the nervous tissues is thought to be responsible of the clinical outcome, a more recent modality of RF application named pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) delivers the RF current without producing destructive levels of heat. In our study, we compared the effects of conventional RF (CRF) and PRF on rabbit dorsal root ganglion (DRG) morphology, including also control and sham operated groups. The setting of the experiment and the RF parameters used were similar to those used in current clinical practice. The specimens were analyzed both with light microscopy and electron microscopy, two weeks after the procedure. At the light microscopic level, all groups had preserved the normal DRG morphology and no differences were observed between them. In the electron microscopic analysis there were no pathological findings in the control and sham operated groups. But the ganglion cells in the RF groups had enlarged endoplasmic reticulum cisterns and increased number of cytoplasmic vacuoles which were more evident in the CRF group. Some of the ganglion cells in the CRF group had mitochondrial degeneration, nuclear membrane disorders or loss of nuclear membrane and neurolemma integrity. The myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers were of normal morphology in all groups. Our results suggest that PRF application is less destructive of cellular morphology than CRF at clinically used ""doses"". Before making certain judgements, more experimental and clinical studies should be planned."

The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers."

To experimentally induce photoreceptor degeneration, the light damage paradigm is frequently used. In this study we show that the exposure to high amounts of cool white light (10,000 lux, 1 h) resulted in a more than 11-fold higher apoptotic rate in the retina compared to light exposure with 5000 lux for 30 min. Consequently, exposure to intense light resulted in a significant downregulation of retinal mRNA expression levels of the reference genes Gapdh, Gnb2l, Rpl32, Rps9, Actb, Ubc or Tbp compared to untreated controls. Investigators performing light-induced photoreceptor degeneration should be aware of the fact that higher light intensities will result in a dysregulation of reference genes."

However, relevant real-world data in patients with baseline brain metastasis (BM) as well as the clinical value of upfront cranial local therapy (CLT) remain scarce. Method(s): Untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with BMs receiving first-line Osimertinib or first-generation EGFR-TKIs at our cancer center were retrospectively enrolled. Progression-free survival (PFS), intracranial PFS (iPFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated in the entire cohort and patient groups created by propensity score matching (PSM). Survival outcomes and pattern of treatment failure were also investigated in patient subgroups stratified by the status of BMs, which was classified as oligo-BM (number<=3 and size<=3cm) and multiple-BM (number>=4 or size>3cm). Result(s): Among the 362 patients enrolled, 265 received first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib=196, Erlotinib=69) and the rest 97 received Osimertinib. Patients receiving first-line Osimertinib had more (p<0.001) and larger BMs (p=0.011) than those receiving first-generation EGFR-TKIs. With a median follow-up of 17.1 months (range, 2.6-73 months), median PFS and OS was 14.6 months and 31 months, respectively. Patient groups (Osimertinib=97, first-generation group=97) were created by PSM with balanced clinic-pathological parameters, and iPFS (32.5 vs 8.4 months, p<0.001), PFS (34.7 vs 11.5months,p<0.001) and OS (40.6 vs 23.8 months, p=0.041) were significantly longer in the Osimertinib group (Figure a-c). Upfront CLT, including surgery, whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS), was performed in 129 patients before disease progression and it prolonged iPFS and PFS, but not OS, in the entire cohort. Among patients with baseline oligo-BMs (n=195), upfront CLT (dominated by SRS) improved iPFS (HR=0.443, p=0.001), PFS (HR=0.373, p<0.001) and OS (HR=0.795, p=0.035) (Figure d-f), which was not the case among patients with baseline multiple-BMs. Pattern of failure analyses indicated that more patients with baseline multiple-BMs turned into the status of oligo-BMs at the maximal response to EGFR-TKIs (p=0.023) and less patients developed progressive disease in the central nervous system (p=0.019) among patients receiving upfront CTL than those didn't. Of note, 8 patients with oligo-BMs but didn't receive upfront CLT developed multiple progressive disease in the brain. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study with considerable sample size verifying the superior efficacy of first-line Osimertinib treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC with BMs. Additionally, upfront brain SRS was recommended for those with oligo-BMs. Keywords: Brain metastasis, osimertinib, cranial radiotherapy Copyright Â© 2021"

We evaluated the impact of adding cediranib to standard chemoradiation (CRT) on peritumoral edema in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma(GBM) during the initial 6 weeks of CRT. Method(s): Two cohorts of patients were enrolled in two clinical trials. The control group (N=13) received radiation for 6 weeks plus temozolomide. The cediranib (CED) group received standard CRT plus daily cediranib (N=34). MRIs were performed at baseline and weekly during CRT. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn outlining the enhancing tumor on T1-weighted post contrast images and the abnormal FLAIR hyperintensity. ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps were calculated from diffusion-weighted images and histograms of the distribution of ADC values created for each visit using the baseline FLAIR VOI to characterize the peritumoraledema. Patients were on stable or decreasing doses of steroids. Result(s): In the CED group, T1 and FLAIR VOI decreased during CRT vs controls where T1 VOI did not change and FLAIR VOI increased. By the end of CRT, the mode of the ADC histogram in the CED group shifted to the left while the mode of the controls shifted to the right. The skewness, a measure of asymmetry of the distribution, increased in the CED group and decreased in controls. Conclusion(s): In patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with CRT and cediranib, tumor volume decreased on T1 and FLAIR images whereas the FLAIR volume significantly increased in the control group suggesting increased edema. The shift of mode to the right and decreasing skewness in controls (indicating an increase in the proportion of very high ADC values) suggests that adding cediranibprevented the development of edema and contributed to the resolution of existing edema. Preventing the edema by adding anti-VEGF treatment may improve the tolerability of CRT for GBM patients. (Table presented) ."

In this work, we report our comprehensive quality assurance (QA) procedure for commissioning this TPS. First, the accuracy of stereotaxy established with a body frame was checked to ensure accurate determination of a target position within the planning system. Second, the CT-to-electron density conversion curve used in the TPS was fitted to our site-specific measurement data to ensure the accuracy of dose calculation and measurement verification in a QA phantom. Using the QA phantom, the radiological path lengths were verified against known geometrical depths to ensure the accuracy of the ray-tracing algorithm. We also checked inter- and intraleaf leakage/transmission for adequate jaw settings. Measurements for dose verification were performed in various head/neck and prostate IMRT treatment plans using the patient-specific optimized fluence maps. Both ion chamber and film were used for point dose and isodose distribution verifications. To ensure that adjacent organs at risk receive dose within the expectation, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for these organs at risk. The dosimetric accuracy satisfied the published acceptability criteria. The Monte Carlo calculations confirmed the measured dose distributions for target volumes. For organs located on the beam boundary or outside the beam, some differences in the DVHs were noticed. However, the plans calculated by both methods met our clinical criteria. We conclude that the accuracy of the XKnifetrade mark RT2 treatment-planning system is adequate for the clinical implementation of stereotactic IMRT."

A 41-year-old woman (case 1) and a 65-year-old man (case 2), both presented with two metastatic brain lesions, one in each hemisphere. The third case was a 65-year-old woman with multiple recurrent atypical meningiomas, who underwent surgical removal in two stages. In the first surgery, only the superior sagittal sinus lesion was excised. Then in the second surgery, multiple disseminated bilateral convexity tumors were excised through a craniotomy on each side. All cases had a remarkable neurological improvement immediately after surgery. We suggest that the indications for surgical removal of multiple brain tumors with two or more craniotomies in the same surgical session are: 1) progressing neurological symptoms, 2) tumors with a maximum diameter more than 2 cm, 3) resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy, 4) ability to tolerate the scheduled surgical time, 5) vital prognosis anticipated to be more than 3 months, 6) expectation of significant neurological improvement, and 7) single-session surgery not carrying more risk than multiple surgeries."
2703,Excluded,"Preconditioning-induced protection of photoreceptors requires activation of the signal-transducing receptor gp130 in photoreceptors Retinal degenerations are a class of neurodegenerative disorders that ultimately lead to blindness due to the death of retinal photoreceptors. In most cases, death is the result of long-term exposure to environmental, inflammatory, and genetic insults. In age-related macular degeneration, significant vision loss may take up to 70-80 years to develop. The protracted time to develop blindness suggests that retinal neurons have an endogenous mechanism for protection from chronic injury. Previous studies have shown that endogenous protective mechanisms can be induced by preconditioning animals with sublethal bright cyclic light. Such preconditioning can protect photoreceptors from a subsequent damaging insult and is thought to be accomplished through induced expression of protective factors. Some of the factors shown to be associated with protection bind and activate the signal transducing receptor gp130. To determine whether stress-induced endogenous protection of photoreceptors requires gp130, we generated conditional gp130 knockout (KO) mice with the Cre/lox system and used light-preconditioning to induce neuroprotection in these mice. Functional and morphological analyses demonstrated that the retina-specific gp130 KO impaired preconditioning-induced endogenous protection. Photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO mice had reduced protection, although the Muller cell KO mice did not, thus gp130-induced protection was restricted to photoreceptors. Using an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that the photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO increased sensitivity to genetically induced photoreceptor cell death, demonstrating that gp130 activation in photoreceptors had a general protective role independent of whether stress was caused by light or genetic mutations."
621,Excluded,"Simultaneous transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation mitigates simulator sickness symptoms in healthy adults: A crossover study Background: Flight simulators have been used to train pilots to experience and recognize spatial disorientation, a condition in which pilots incorrectly perceive the position, location, and movement of their aircrafts. However, during or after simulator training, simulator sickness (SS) may develop. Spatial disorientation and SS share common symptoms and signs and may involve a similar mechanism of dys-synchronization of neural inputs from the vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive systems. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a maneuver used for pain control, was found to influence autonomic cardiovascular responses and enhance visuospatial abilities, postural control, and cognitive function. The purpose of present study was to investigate the protective effects of TENS on SS. Method(s): Fifteen healthy young men (age: 28.6 +/- 0.9 years, height: 172.5 +/- 1.4 cm, body weight: 69.3 +/- 1.3 kg, body mass index: 23.4 +/- 1.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in this within-subject crossover study. SS was induced by a flight simulator. TENS treatment involved 30 minutes simultaneous electrical stimulation of the posterior neck and the right Zusanli acupoint. Each subject completed 4 sessions (control, SS, TENS, and TENS + SS) in a randomized order. Outcome indicators included SS symptom severity and cognitive function, evaluated with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and d2 test of attention, respectively. Sleepiness was rated using the Visual Analogue Scales for Sleepiness Symptoms (VAS-SS). Autonomic and stress responses were evaluated by heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary stress biomarkers (salivary alpha-amylase activity and salivary cortisol concentration). Result(s): Simulator exposure increased SS symptoms (SSQ and VAS-SS scores) and decreased the task response speed and concentration. The heart rate, salivary stress biomarker levels, and the sympathetic parameter of HRV increased with simulator exposure, but parasympathetic parameters decreased (p < 0.05). After TENS treatment, SS symptom severity significantly decreased and the subjects were more able to concentrate and made fewer cognitive test errors (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Sympathetic activity increased and parasympathetic activity decreased after simulator exposure. TENS was effective in reducing SS symptoms and alleviating cognitive impairment.Trial registration number: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register: http://ACTRN12612001172897.

Nearly half the neurons (48.4%) showed significant (p < 0.05) negative correlations between spontaneous discharges and the power of the frontal lobe EEG delta rhythm; most of these cells could be identified as cholinergic projection neurons. Neurons of this group had predominantly excitatory responses to the conditioned stimulus during performance of the operant task, while the responses to the conditioned stimulus of presumptively non-cholinergic neurons, not projecting to the cortex, were mainly inhibitory. The activatory responses of neurons in the basal magnocellular nucleus to the conditioned stimulus were markedly stronger while the animals performed the operant response as compared with performances in which there was no response to the conditioned stimulus. These results provide evidence that the basal magnocellular nucleus supports the level of waking and attending required for performance of operant conditioned reflex activity."

Clinical Basis for Prevention and Treatment: In our department, 300 cases of malignant tumors of nasal cavity and sinuses were treated within 10 years. Age: Eighty-six cases (28.6%) were in the age group 50-59 years old, occupying first place, and 55 cases (18.3%) were in the age group 60-69 years old, occupying second place. By comparing groups A and B with malignant tumors of the nasal cavity and sinuses, the difference in age distribution of olfactory neuroblastoma is statistically significant. Of the 35 cases of olfactory neuroblastoma, 23 cases were diagnosed with nasal tumors on admission, 12 cases were initially diagnosed with nasal polyps (including 7 cases with hemorrhagic and necrotic nasal polyps), and 20 cases underwent rapid pathologic definite diagnosis during the operation. Diagnosis for Postoperative Pathologic Returns: On the basis of our analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: Of the 300 cases of malignant tumors of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, age distribution tends to be younger, the overall incidence of males is higher than that of females, but the proportion of male and female olfactory neuroblastoma is equal, and the incidence of adenoid cystic carcinoma and sarcoma. The morphology of cancer can be divided as follows: the tissue source is epithelial tissue, the cancer is harder, paler, drier, and often forms cancer nests, the parenchymal and interstitial boundaries are clear, and the fibrous tissue is hyperplastic. The incidence rate of females is higher than that of males, with the primary origin in the sinuses. Among them, the maxillary sinus is more common.

The latent period was found to be dependent on dose in the ED0 to ED100 dose range, independent of dose in the range ED100 to 1.5 times the ED100 dose and dependent on dose for doses more than 1.5 times the ED100 dose. Histologically, some vascular injury and demyelinization were observed in the irradiated cord segment of all paretic animals. In the first dose-dependent region there was a bimodal distribution of latent periods, suggesting two mechanisms for paralysis in this dose region. A hypothesis based on glial and vascular injury is presented which explains the triphasic dose-response relationship for the latent period. The 95% confidence limits for the dose location of both of the dose-dependent regions were less than 10% of the administered dose. Therefore, if used correctly, the latent period as an end point should be able to be used to detect dose-modifying parameters (i.e. RBE and OER) that are greater than 20%."

1524,Excluded,"Autofluorescence spectroscopy as a proxy for chronic white matter pathology Background: The balance of tissue injury and repair ultimately determines outcomes of chronic neurological disorders, such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the extent of pathology can be difficult to detect, particularly when it is insidious and/or offset by tissue regeneration. Objective(s): The objective of this research is to evaluate whether tissue autofluorescence-typically a source of contamination-provides a surrogate marker of white matter injury. Method(s): Tissue autofluorescence in autopsied specimens both experimental and clinical was characterized by spectral confocal microscopy and correlated to severity and chronicity as determined by standard histopathology. Result(s): Months after cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination, despite robust remyelination, autofluorescent deposits progressively accumulated in regions of prior pathology. Autofluorescent deposits (likely reflecting myelin debris remnants) were conspicuously localized to white matter, proportional to lesion severity, and displayed differential fluorescence over time. Strikingly, similar features were apparent also in autopsied MS tissue. Conclusion(s): Autofluorescence spectroscopy illuminates prior and ongoing white matter injury. The accumulation of autofluorescence in proportion to the extent of progressive atrophy, despite robust remyelination in the CPZ brain, provides important proof-of-concept of a phenomenon (insidious ongoing damage masked by mechanisms of tissue repair) that we hypothesize is highly relevant to the progressive phase of MS.

To confirm the effect of this approach, we analyzed more patients with long term follow up. Materials/Methods: From January 1992 to Dec 2003, 222 patients (74 T3 and 148 T4 NPC) were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT). HFRT was administered at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, Monday-Friday for 62 fractions for a total dose of 74.4 Gy. Concomitant chemotherapy consisting of cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum (CDDP) alone or CDDP and 5-fluorouracil were delivered simultaneously with radiotherapy during Weeks 1 and 6. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of CDDP and 5-fluorouracil for 2 to 3 cycles and was given monthly beginning 1 month after completion of radiation. Result(s):With a median follow-up of 102 months (range: 5 - 186 months), the 5-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 81.9%, 78.5%, 65.5% and 73.6%, respectively. At 10 years, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 76.7%, 75.5%, 60.5% and 64.2%, respectively. For T4 patients, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 73.0%, 70.5%, 53.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The major chronic toxicity was Grade 3/4 hearing impairment in 14% of patients. Brain necrosis rate is 2.3%. Conclusion(s): HFRT and CCT for T3 and T4 NPC were associated with good local control, survival and little treatment-related long term toxicity. But, the 10 year treatment result is suboptimal. To further improve the 10 year locoregional control rate for T4 NPC patients, we may consider using HFRT to give higher radiation dose up to 78 Gy with CCT in the IMRT era."
2904,Included,"Delayed effects of brain irradiation-part 1: Adrenocortical axis dysfunction and hippocampal damage in an adult rat model Background: Brain irradiation (BI) in humans may cause behavioral changes, cognitive impairment and neuroendocrine dysfunction. The effect of BI on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is not fully understood. Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of BI on HPA axis responses under basal and stressful conditions as well as following pretreatment with dexamethasone (Dex). Method(s): Adult male rats were exposed to whole BI. HPA axis responses were examined at 2, 4, 9 and 20 weeks after BI. Histological evaluations of the irradiated rats and matched controls were conducted at 4 and 20 weeks after BI. Result(s): In contrast to the control group, the basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels were enhanced at 9 and 20 weeks after BI and the inhibitory effect of Dex was reduced. BI also caused hyposuppression of the adrenocortical response to stress. Histological assessment of the irradiated brains revealed hippocampal atrophy at 20 weeks after BI. The neuronal counts were lower only in the CA1 region of the irradiated brains. BI caused a decrease in the binding capacity of Dex to the hippocampal cytosolic fraction. Conclusion(s): Enhanced stress-induced HPA axis responses and the reduced effect of Dex suggest that BI has delayed effects on HPA axis responses as manifested by impairment of the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids (GCs). The mechanisms underlying these effects of BI are unknown. It is possible that the marked BI-induced damage in the hippocampus, which plays an important role in the regulation of the feedback effect of GCs, may cause abnormal HPA axis responses following BI.

1569,Excluded,"Acta Oncologica Lecture. Gastrointestinal consequences of cancer treatment and the wider context: a bad gut feeling BACKGROUND: The percentage of people living with a diagnosis of cancer is rising globally. Between 20% and 25% of people treated for cancer experience a consequence of cancer which has an adverse impact on the quality of their life. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are the most common of all consequences of cancer treatment and have the greatest impact on daily activity. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF LONG-TERM BOWEL DAMAGE AFTER PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY: Long-term damage to the bowel after radiotherapy is mediated by ischaemic changes and fibrosis. Each fraction of radiotherapy causes a series of repetitive injuries to the intestinal tissue resulting in an altered healing process, which affects the integrity of the repair and changes the architecture of the bowel wall. THE NATURE OF GI SYMPTOMS THAT DEVELOP: Patient-reported outcome measures show that diarrhoea, urgency, increased bowel frequency, tenesmus and flatulence are the five most prevalent GI symptoms with a moderate or severe impact on patients' daily lives after treatment with pelvic radiotherapy. Many patients also experience fatigue, urinary problems and have sexual concerns. SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT: The complex nature of those symptoms warrants systematic assessment and management. The use of a tested algorithm can assist in achieving this. The most common contributing factors to ongoing bowel problems after pelvic radiotherapy are small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bile acid malabsorption, pancreatic insufficiency, rectal bleeding and its impact on bone health.THE WIDER CONTEXT: Symptom burden, socio-psychosocial impact, memory and cognitive function, fatigue, urinary problems and sexual concerns need to be taken into account when thinking about consequences of cancer treatment.CONCLUSION: As our understanding of consequences of cancer treatments continues to emerge and encompass a wide variety of specialties, a holistic, multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach is required to manage those consequences long-term."

After 4 weeks of treatment, we observed the changes by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: (1) The average optical density of DBH-ir fibers and the number of alpha1-adrenoreceptor- and estrogen receptor (ER)alpha-positive neurons in the main nuclei of POAH were all reduced in OVX rats compared with the SHAM group. The above changes were normalized in all nuclei of the POAH in the E2 group, while they were normalized in some nuclei in the ICR group. Coexpression of ERalpha and alpha1-adrenoreceptor was observed in the POAH. (2) The number of DBH- and ERalpha-positive neurons in the LC decreased in the OVX group compared with the SHAM group and increased after treatment with E2 and ICR. Coexpression of ERalpha and DBH was observed in the LC.CONCLUSION: Low estrogen (OVX) altered norepinephrine synthesis in the LC, the projection of norepinephrine fibers and alpha1-adrenoreceptor expression in the POAH. Both E2 and ICR normalized the norepinephrine pathway, but E2 achieved greater effects than ICR.

In one experiment, the burst-firing pattern was presented once every 4 s for 30 min and restricted to the positive polarity, negative polarity or a bipolar equivalent. The strongest analgesia occurred when the burst-firing pattern was presented with positive polarity or as the typical bipolar signal. Administrations of the burst-firing pattern once per week for four consecutive weeks produced analgesia that was clearly evident during the first, third, and fourth weeks but not during the second week of treatment. A telephone sensor coil (that can be readily obtained from local electronic shops) was then used instead of the solenoids along with an audio (.wav) file to generate the magnetic field; the analgesia was still apparent. However, when the magnetic pattern was generated from a compact disc source the analgesia was not evoked. The current results suggest that these fields can be generated through simple commercial devices controlled by available computer software."
1407,Excluded,"Whole-brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery in brain metastases: what is the evidence? The overall local treatment paradigm of brain metastases, which includes whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), continues to evolve. Local therapies play an important role in the management of brain metastases. The choice of local therapy depends on factors that involve the patient (performance status, expected survival, and age), the prior treatment history, and the tumor (type and subtype, number, size, location of metastases, and extracranial disease status). Multidisciplinary collaboration is required to facilitate an individualized plan to improve the outcome of disease in patients with this life-limiting complication. There has been concern about the neurocognitive effects of WBRT. A number of approaches that mitigate cognitive dysfunction, such as pharmacologic intervention (memantine) or a hippocampal-sparing strategy, have been studied in a prospective manner with WBRT. Although there has been an increase in the use of SRS in the management of brain metastases in recent years, WBRT retains an important therapeutic role."
2409,Excluded,"Thoracic radiotherapy of SCLC Limited stage: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 10-15% of all lung tumors and is associated with an aggressive clinical behavior. Two out of three patients presents with hematogenous metastases at diagnosis (extensive stage (ES)). For patients without hematogenous metastases (limited stage (LS)), chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment. Although radiotherapy after chemotherapy has the theoretical benefit of treating smaller target volumes with less toxicity, concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown to be superior. Moreover, earlier use of radiotherapy during chemotherapy leads to better results. The absolute benefit of early versus late radiotherapy was about 10% for patients who had received cisplatinum-based chemotherapy.1 Turrisi et al.2 demonstrated that twice daily radiotherapy starting with a first course of chemotherapy resulted in improved survival rates. Median survival was 23 months for patients who received twice-daily radiotherapy (45 Gy/30 fractions/3 weeks) versus 19 months for once daily treated patients (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). The corresponding 5 years survival rates were 26% and 16%. However, more Grade 3-4 oesophagitis was seen during twice-daily treatment (32% versus 16%). Only a minority of patients in the US and Europe receive twice daily radiotherapy. Recently the results of the CONVERT trial, in which once-daily radiotherapy (70Gy) was compared with twice daily radiotherapy (45 Gy) were presented.3 Radiotherapy was initiated at the 2nd course of 4-6 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. Overall survival at 2 years was 56% for patients treated twice-daily versus 51% for patients treated once-daily (p= 0.15).3 There was also no significant difference in time to progression. There were no differences in a acute toxicity, except for Grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred more often in the twicedaily treatment arm (74% versus 65%). There were no differences in Grade 3-5 oesophagitis (19%) and pneumonitis (2%). The authors concluded that survival in both study arms was higher than reported previously and that radiation related toxicities were lower than expected, probably related to the use of modern radiotherapy techniques. The results of the study support the use of either twice daily or once daily as standard of care for patients with limited stage disease and in good performance score. In RTOG0538 study, which also compares 70 Gy once-daily and 45 Gy twice-daily radiotherapy, radiotherapy commences with the first or second course of chemotherapy. The results of this study are eagerly awaited.4 Extensive stage: In the EORTC study on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for ES-SCLC, it was noted that the vast majority of patients still had intrathoracic disease after completion of chemotherapy. After on the positive effects of PCI which not only reduced the risk of symptomatic brain metastases (40 versus 15%) but also improved overall survival (1 year: 27 versus 13% (P= 0,003)),5 the next logical step was to investigate the use of thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC as well. Evidence for a possible role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in ESSCLC also comes from the results of a trial published by Jeremic et al. in 19996 in which patients with ES-SCLC and good prognosis with a complete response outside the thorax were randomized between TRT plus PCI during chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and PCI only. Overall survival was 17 months for the patients who received thoracic radiotherapy versus 11 months for those who did not. In the CREST trial, patients with ES-SCLC and any response after 4-6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy were randomized between PCI plus TRT (30Gy/10 fractions) or PCI only. Overall survival at one year, the primary endpoint of the study, was not statistically significant between the groups (p=0.066) but with longer follow up the survival curves diverged and at 2 years, survival was 13% in patients who received TRT versus 3% in the controls (p=0,004). There was also significant dif erence in progression free survival. In an additional analysis of patients with and without residual intrathoracic disease, which was one of the stratification factors of the study, it was demonstrated that there was no significant benefit of TRT in patients with a CR in the thorax. However, in patients with residual intrathoracic disease after chemotherapy, TRT led to a significant improvement in overall survival. 7 In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the risk of intrathoracic recurrence was reduced from 80% to 44%. In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the most recurrences occurred outside the brain and the thorax and at a later stage. The next logical step after demonstration of a beneficial effect of PCI and TRT would be the use of higher doses for TRT and possibly also treatment of extrathoracic metastatic sites. This topic was addressed in the NRG-RTOG0937 study and was presented at ASTRO 2015.8 patients with ES-SCLC and a CR or PR after chemotherapy and 1-4 metastatic lesions were randomized between PCI or PCI plus TRT plus radiotherapy of metastatic sites. The study which accrued very slowly was closed early due to observed toxicities. The study did not show a survival difference between the two groups, but included only 86 patients over a five years period and had imbalance groups with worse prognostic factors in the experimental arm. There were many, partly unrelated, Grade 4-5 toxicities in the experimental arm. To define which patients are most likely to benefit from a more aggressive approach we have performed an additional analysis for patients from the top accruing centers from the CREST trial. An evaluation of 260 patients showed significantly better outcome in patients with 0 to 2 metastases versus and without liver metastases.10 These patients are believed to be best candidates for future studies."
1692,Included,"Myelin repair by Schwann cells in the regenerating goldfish visual pathway: regional patterns revealed by X-irradiation In the regenerating goldfish optic nerves, Schwann cells of unknown origin reliably infiltrate the lesion site forming a band of peripheral-type myelinating tissue by 1-2 months, sharply demarcated from the adjacent new CNS myelin. To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue."
108,Excluded,"The physical basis of neuroimaging techniques During the past 20 years, the technology of neuroimaging has improved on all fronts. Coupled with increased human ingenuity and the greater power of digital computers, modern imaging methods are capable of providing precise measurements of brain structure and sensitive assessments of brain function. The complementary nature of different techniques adds to their value, whereas the rivalry between modalities continues to catalyze the pace of technical advances. Although there may appear to be choices to be made as to which technique should be used for certain purposes, in many instances there are clear advantages and reasons to select a particular method. Some of these advantages were mentioned in this article, but here we summarize some of the relevant issues. Nuclear medicine techniques have almost no role in anatomic imaging because they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot hi general distinguish many types of tissues to permit structural analysis. Although CT provides excellent images of the skull, sulci, and ventricles, and is capable of providing volumetric and dynamic images with recent advances such as spiral scanning, it is unlikely in the future to challenge MR imaging for structural studies. CT exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and at acceptable doses cannot provide the soft-tissue differentiation needed for must structural studies. MR imaging systems based on magnets of moderate to high field strength provide images with contrast and spatial resolution superior to those of any other imaging method. In the foreseeable future, there appears to be no other imaging technique capable of providing the quality of anatomic information rendered by MR imaging. Furthermore, it is clear that continuing advances in MR imaging technology, such as the development of new magnets and improved RF coils, will lead to further improvements in image quality beyond that obtainable today, most likely at lower costs than previous systems. In addition, the development of higher field strength systems (operating at 3-5 T) will provide information at a spatial scale not previously available except in specialized animal imaging systems, so that in vivo resolution of 100 mum will be possible in many centers. One primary challenge will be to develop computer image analysis techniques capable of handling the wealth of anatomic detail provided by MR imaging in reasonable times and at reasonable cost. Functional methods will continue to evolve. Functional MR imaging is less than 4 years old but has already progressed to the point where it can provide data in some studies to rival the best available by other means. Questions regarding the superiority of functional MR imaging or PET, however, cannot be conclusively addressed now, and in fact may not be sensible; both will remain important for the next several years. There are realistic expectations that functional MR imaging will yield semi-quantitative measures of flow and oxygenation in individual subjects in a large number of cognitive and other tasks, and using functional MR imaging we should learn a great deal about the distribution and connectedness of neural systems involved with different functions. The major challenges will be in designing interpretable studies that lend themselves to the functional MR imaging format and in improving the reliability of the functional MR imaging data. Higher field magnets, providing images with higher SNR as well as being more sensitive to microscopic susceptibility effects, should increase the sensitivity of functional MR imaging. The ability to perform multiple repeated studies on individuals and its intrinsic safety, coupled with its high spatial resolution, assures it of an evolving role in the study of brain activation. PET will also continue to be used for many such activation studies. PET facilities uniquely can perform studies of organic disorders such as tumors, receptor systems, and metabolism. PET enjoys high sensitivity to activation and, in the right hands, can provide absolute quantification of flow changes as wel as resting flow, a task currently beyond functional MR imaging BOLD methods. Some improvements in spatial resolution and sensitivity can be expected from different detector systems."

Significant histological changes and BBB disruption were observed in brain regions heated to 43 degrees C and above. In the cortex heated to 41 degrees C, the CBF doubled 20 min after hyperthermia induction, and then returned gradually to the pre-hyperthermic level. In the cortex heated to 43 degrees C, the CBF increased to 134% of the baseline level 10 min after hyperthermia induction, and then fell gradually to reach its minimum level (31% of the baseline level). In the cortex heated to 45 degrees C, the CBF decreased immediately after hyperthermia induction to reach 10% of the baseline level. The results indicate that hyperthermia-induced cellular injury in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral ischaemia and the threshold temperature for such injury is 43 degrees C. This model is useful for investigating the effects of hyperthermia on various cerebral functions and the CBF changes demonstrated in the present study may provide key information for the analysis of other cerebral functions."

Complete and partial response in both groups was comparable, and the overall survival was comparable. However, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and irradiation in comparison with the radiotherapy alone group. Disease-free survival was higher in the concomitant chemotherapy-radiotherapy patients, although survival was not significantly modified, probably because of suboptimal chemotherapy. The initial intrathoracic failure rate was 40.7% inthe concomitant chemotherapy-irradiation group, compared with 53.8% in the radiotherapy-alone patients. None of the patients receiving delayed chemotherapy following the radiotherapy recurrence showed significant tumor response to the drugs. The incidence of distant metastasis was slightly lower in the chemotherapy groups. Brain metastases were noted in 7% of the patients in both groups. Increased intrathoracic recurrences were noted in patients with lower doses of irradiation. Nine of 13 patients treated with inadequate portals developed intrathoracic recurrences in comparison to 13 of 40 treated with adequate irradiation fields.

Several large cohort studies of 80-198 patients have reported complication rates of 2.5% to 9% using particles or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA).[1-5] However, although a recent national registry of 898 patients found an association between liquid embolysate and complication rates, with an odds ratio of 3.9.[6] Endovascular technology continues to evolve and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH or Onyx Medtronic) has been available for embolization of arteriovenous malformations for over a decade. The off-label use of EVOH for pre-operative embolization of meningiomas or hemangiopericytomas has only been reported in small series. This study reviewed the safety profile and embolization duration of our experience with EVOH embolization. Methods Review of institutional records identified 72 consecutive cases of meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas that underwent pre-operative embolization with EVOH prior to surgical resection from 2007 to 2017. The imaging and medical records were reviewed to identify tumor dimensions, vascular pedicles, endovascular equipment, outcomes and complications. Embolization rate was compared with Wilcox signed-rank test and complication rates were compared using the Fisher exact test. Results The tumors measured 5 cm (IQR 4.4-6.3) or 45 cm<sup>3</sup> (23-71) and were located on the convexity (26%), tentorium (22%), falx (20%), sphenoid ridge (15%), petrous (5%), anterior cranial fossa (5%), infratemporal fossa (4%), and middle cranial fossa (3%). The most frequent pedicle embolized was a middle meningeal artery. In 83% of cases, this was the first pedicle embolized and in 24% of cases, an additional MMA catheterization was used for embolization. Additional pedicles included the internal maxillary (8), occipital artery (7), superficial temporal (4), posterior meningeal (2), posterior auricular (1), and ascending pharyngeal (1) arteries. Tumor supply from branches of the internal carotid artery were typically not embolized: anterior cerebral branches (3 embolized: 7 not embolized), middle cerebral branches (0:11), ophthalmic branches (0:11). In 7 cases, nBCA was also used, most commonly in the superior cerebellar artery (3:7). Abstract O-033 Table 1 Tumor embolization characteristics VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP There were symptomatic complications from embolization in 8% of cases. Twice, tumor necrosis and edema required earlier craniotomy and tumor evacuation, and four patients had new neurologic deficit from infarct. Two occurred from reflux and two occurred from embolysate migration across the tumor to pial vessels. The complication rate was not different from studies in meningiomas with 75 or more cases using other embolysates (p-value 0.15-1.0). In power analysis, comparison against previously published studies would distinguish a complication rate of 23% in a series of this size. Conclusion Embolization with EVOH is comparable in safety to other embolization techniques in meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Similar to what has been described in arteriovenous malformations, simultaneous dual catheter embolization may decrease procedural time and radiation exposure."

Method(s): From 1983 to 1994, 65 patients with SCLC were treated by surgery combined with postoperative chemotherapy, and 22 of them received prophylactic cranial irradiation. Result(s): In 64 evaluable patients, the overall 1-, 3- and 5- year survival rates were 87. 5%, 53. 20% and 36. 3%. Patients treated by radical operation plus chemotherapy gave 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of 92.5%, 58.5% and 43.8%. The prognostic surviving factors as analysed showed that statistical differences were observed between stage I and II, I and III A (P<0.03), N<inf>0</inf> and N<inf>1</inf> (P<0.021) in 3-year survival rate, between 2~3 and 4~6 cycle chemotherapy in 1- year survival rate (P<0.007).

2529,Excluded,Seizure modulation with applied electric fields in chronically implanted animals Low Frequency (<<100Hz) applied electric fields have been shown to modulate neuronal activity both In Vitro and in acute whole animal studies. We have been working to apply this technology for seizure control in chronically implanted animals. We have developed electronics for simultaneously recording neural activity while stimulating with low frequency fields. We have observed transient entrainment of spike and wave activity during spontaneous seizures with open loop sinusoidal stimulation with frequencies between 9-15 Hz. This is the first demonstration of low frequency field modulation of neural activity in chronically implanted mammalian brain.

Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) starts at 2 weeks after 1st infusion of bevacizumab and continues for 5 weeks. Total mesorectal excision is planned at 6-8 weeks post CRT. Immunohistochemical staining to study the functionality of blood vessels and Luminex analyses to assess the changes in circulating VEGF ligands are performed on tissues and blood samples from consenting pts. Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, safety profile and identification of biomarkers for early response prediction are the main endpoints. Result(s): Sixty five pts with median age 60 have been enrolled to date. Fifty seven pts completed the full protocol scheme, with a relative dose intensity of 97% for bevacizumab, 95% for capecitabine and 93% for oxaliplatin. Preliminary safety data from 60 evaluable pts show that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Most severe adverse events were post-operative (wound infections, leaks) in 9 pts, equally distributed between arms. During CRT, grade 3 toxicities were more frequent in Arm A: fatigue (1), diarrhea (2), infection (2), febrile neutropenia (1), sensory neuropathy (1). Two pts deceased due to disease progression and one due to lung embolism post-surgery. Fifty two pts are evaluable for response. pCR was seen in 11 pts, 30% (8/26) in Arm A and 12% (3/26) in Arm B (p = 0.08). The rate of good responders (Dworak TRG 3,4) was higher in Arm A 18/26 versus Arm B 10/26 (p = 0.05). Changes in the pericyt coverage of the blood vessels, proliferation of the tumour cells and plasma concentrations of PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB and VEGF were observed and will be further assessed. Conclusion(s): Chemoradiotherapy in combination with bevacizumab showed an acceptable safety profile in this patient population. Adding oxaliplatin determined a slight increase of toxicity but might enhance the percentage of responders. PDGF may be a predictor of response in this setting. Further analyses are ongoing.

3156,Excluded,"Environmental damage to the retina and preconditioning: contrasting effects of light and hyperoxic stress PURPOSE: Environmental stress (bright light, hypoxia) can ""condition"" retinal photoreceptors, increasing their resistance to subsequent stress. The present study tests whether another photoreceptor-lethal stress, hyperoxia, can induce similar resistance.METHODS: Vulnerability to hyperoxia was tested in young adult C57BL/6J mice exposed to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week or to 50% O2 for 1 week and then to 75% O2 for 2 weeks. Vulnerability to light was tested in Balb/cJ mice exposed to 300 lux cyclic light for 2 days or to 75% O2 for 2 weeks and then to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week. Retinas were analyzed for photoreceptor death, levels of stress-related proteins (GFAP, FGF-2, MnSOD, acrolein), and the regulation of candidate neuroprotective genes (HSP70.1, Ledgf, FGF-13, Timp2).RESULTS: Light preconditioning did not cause measurable death of photoreceptors but reduced photoreceptor death induced by subsequent hyperoxic or light stress, reduced levels of stress-related proteins, and maintained the length and organization of photoreceptor outer segments. Hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable cell death but provided no protection against subsequent hyperoxic or light stress. Of the four candidate neuroprotective proteins examined, the regulation of only one (Timp2) seemed associated with the neuroprotection observed.CONCLUSIONS: Light preconditioning, causing only minimal damage to photoreceptors, induced protection against subsequent stress from both hyperoxia and light. By contrast, hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable photoreceptor damage but induced no protection against light or hyperoxia. These data suggest a separation between stress-induced damage to photoreceptors and the upregulation of protective mechanisms, encouraging the search for ways to protect the retina without damaging it."

I was an Astronaut with two space shuttle missions already completed. I was aware of the progressive and degenerative path the disease follows but, I was not ready to quit flying into earth orbit. NASA managers responsible for crew selection and certification were fully behind my desire to continue in the cue for another space mission. With the exception of the NASA leadership I kept my condition as a secret for 17 years. I was assigned to a third space shuttle mission and I performed a space walk during the mission in March 1996. This was very rewarding. I told myself to ""Live life to the fullest extent possible"". My message to those with Parkinson Disease is you can do anything you want to do - maybe not as well as you use to perform. I still play golf. My game is not as good as it was years ago but I enjoy the game. My friends enjoy playing with me and the exercise is good therapy. The disease has progressed as expected. I no longer fly privately and I do miss the exhilaration of precise flying. I still live life's adventures to the fullest. I encourage those with Parkinson Disease to be well informed of current research and the multitude of varied therapy options. Any program that improves the quality of your life should be explored. Exploration is fun and beneficial. Stories from my space shuttle missions will be interjected at appropriate places for emphasis.

A person can imagine an event never experienced, drawing on constructs of events that have been experienced. For example, a non-astronaut can imagine being on a rocket ship traveling to the moon based on a variety of life experiences. We sought to characterize the brain activity that occurs when one imagines severe catastrophic pain beyond anything ever actually experienced. Our specific goal is to test whether past experience with or without chronic pain is reflected in the brain systems of pain imagery. We completed preliminary analysis on 14 healthy volunteers, 25 individuals with chronic low back pain, and 12 individuals who have recovered from an acute episode of low back pain. During block-design fMRI scanning, participants were instructed to imagine severe catastrophic pain involving bone-crushing injuries while their entire body is on fire. In our preliminary analysis, all groups had prefrontal activity during task performance. Comparing across all three groups, there was relatively little brain activity in individuals who had recovered from low back pain. There was a moderate amount of brain activity for healthy individuals, in a reasonably distributed pattern throughout the brain. There was a large amount of brain activity for individuals with current low back pain, including significant activity of bilateral anterior insula. These preliminary results suggest that experience with pain can be reflected in the imagery of catastrophic pain. The difference between individuals who have experienced recovery versus persistence of pain is particularly striking, and this difference may provide insight into mechanisms with additional data and analysis."

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) on picture naming in 24 probable AD patients with different degrees of cognitive decline.METHODS: High-frequency rTMS was applied to the left and right dlPFC during object and action naming in AD patients. A sham stimulation was used as a control condition.RESULTS: Whilst, as previously reported, stimulation to both the left and the right dlPFC improved action, but not object naming in the mild AD group; an improved naming accuracy for both classes of stimuli was found in the moderate to severe group.CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the dlPFC improves naming performance also in the advanced stages of AD. Moreover, in the severe group the effect is not specific for action naming, as in the case of the mild AD group. These findings suggest that rTMS can affect the intrinsic ability of the brain to restore or compensate for damaged function and may represent an useful new tool for cognitive rehabilitation."

However, little is known about the long-term effects of combined microgravity and low-dose radiation. We exposed mice to gamma radiation using a cobalt-57 plate (0.01 cGy/h for a total dose of 0.04 Gy), hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, or a combination of both for 3 weeks. Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction."

All patients underwent pretreatment evaluation at the university's Multidisciplinary Lung Cancer Center. Most patients (87%) had complete mediastinoscopy staging, and all were believed to be poor candidates for up-front operation because of bulky extent of disease. The radiotherapy program used conventional, 2-dimensionally planned treatment to 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8- to 2-Gy fraction size. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of etoposide/cisplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel. Study end points included resectability, pathologic response, local-regional control, survival, and toxicity. An exploratory comparison between pathologic response and long-term survival was performed. An exploratory comparison between older chemotherapy (etoposide/cisplatin) and third-generation chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) was also performed.RESULTS: Of 53 patients, 45 (85%) were deemed surgical candidates after induction therapy. Twenty-two (42% of the initial cohort) patients had a major pathologic response to stage 0, I, or II disease. The 5-year actuarial survival was 31%. Major pathologic response was associated with improved survival (48% vs 24%; P =.027). The overall rate of early death potentially related to therapy in this series was 9%; this mostly occurred in patients who underwent right pneumonectomy. There was no difference in efficacy or mortality between etoposide/cisplatin and radiotherapy versus carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy, although the latter regimen was associated with less grade 3 or higher acute toxicity necessitating interruption or hospitalization during neoadjuvant treatment (P =.02). In-field local control was achieved in 83% of all patients (90% of the patients who underwent resection). Brain metastases as the first site of treatment failure occurred in 23% of all patients.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation delivers high resectability, major pathologic response rate, and excellent local-regional control, with encouraging long-term survival considering the patient population studied. Major pathologic response correlates with long-term survival. Neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy is an appropriate framework on which to add new therapies."
3160,Included,"Combined effect of irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats The accidents in atomic electric stations took place in many countries. The most severe catastrophe was happened in 1986 in Ukraine. The population in Chernobyl region is suffering both from the consequences of irradiation and polyvitamine deficiency. Can it be related with the increased alcohol consumption observed in that region? To test this hypotheses we have studied the influence of the thiamine and folate deficiency and low dose irradiation and their combination on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. 80 adult male rats waiting 140-180 g. were preliminary tested in the conditions of free choice between 10% ethanol and water (triple, during 2 days). Then they were divided into 4 groups (on 20 animals) equal on the alcohol consumption and preference. 2 weeks later they were treated by hidrochythiamine (vitamin B1 antagonist, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) and metotrexate (folic acid antagonist, 200 mg/kg, s.c.) weekly, three times. 2 days following the every administration the some animals were treated by the gamma-irradiation (Co60, 0.25 gray). The groups were: 1- control (isotonic solution of NaCl); 2- irradiation alone; 3- antivitamins; 4- antivitamins + irradiations. Next day following the last irradiation half of animals from every group were sacrificed and vitamins status in their tissues was studied. Others were tested during 14 days individually in situation of free choice between 10% ethanol solution and water. In groups 2-4 the decreased transketolase activity (marker thiamine-dependent enzyme) and thiamine diphosphate level in blood, liver and brain as well as signs of folic deficiency were found. In groups 3 and 4 the alcohol preference index on the first week of post-irradiation testing period increased on 40.8 and 112.7% (p<0.05); on the second week on 19,1 and 81.4% (P <0.05) accordingly. In conclusion, the combination of low dose irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency increases the alcohol preference and consumption in rats. Those factors may be one of the reason of alcohol addiction also in population of Chernobyl region."

The pathological process develops gradually. The reactive changes in neurons and synapses, observed immediately after withdrawal of the electromagnetic action. increase during the following three months and result in coarse destructive disorders and in death of some neurons and synapses. In 6 months certain signs of restoration of the structures are observed. Under the effect of electromagnetic radiation water redistribution between the structures takes place, the sympathetic terminals loosing their fluid. Thus, certain conditions are produced for sticking together the synaptic vesicles. Possibly that deficiency of Ca++ ions contributes to it."

In this study, 483 patients were undergoing LDRT for degenerative joint disease of the fingers and thumb at the University Hospital Erlangen between 2004 and 2019. Radiotherapy was applied according to the German guidelines for LDRT. Several impact factors on therapeutic success, such as the age and gender, the number of affected fingers, the single and cumulative dose, as well as the number of series, were investigated. In summary, 70% of the patients showed an improvement of their pain following LDRT. No significant impact was found for the factors age, gender, the number of series or the cumulative dosage. Patients with an involvement of the thumb showed a significantly worse outcome compared to patients with an isolated affection of the fingers. In this cohort, patients receiving a single dose of 0.5 Gy reported a significantly better outcome than patients receiving 1.0 Gy, strongly suggesting a reduction in the total dose. In summary, LDRT is a good alternative treatment option for patients suffering from degenerative and inflammatory joint disease of the fingers."

The objects of the study were to determine: (1) whether United Kingdom ophthalmologists who used argon lasers had the elevation of colour-contrast thresholds previously discovered and (2) whether other users of argon lasers showed any unusual loss of colour vision. A total of 1072 UK ophthalmologists filled in a questionnaire about their professional use of lasers, the length of time spent operating, and their out-of-doors activities. Their colour vision was then tested by a new sensitive system, and if any abnormality was detected, a clinical eye examination was performed. The results were as follows: (1) Colour vision testing was shown to be reliable. Any self-selection bias was excluded. Test-retest variability was small. Normal results did not change during the survey. (2) A number of men with high red-green thresholds were discovered. Some were aware of their congenital insensitivity. The frequency of all such defects was less than the known incidence of congenital colour deficiency in the male population. (3) Additionally a number of high tritan (blue-yellow) thresholds were encountered, some associated with reported diabetes and hypertension. In other cases of this type, undetected or unacknowledged systemic disease may be present. (4) After making allowance for all these incidental causes of loss of colour vision, and for the effect of age on colour vision (which is very small) only four of the sample were > 2 SD above normal. (5) However, the average blue-yellow thresholds of ophthalmologists were slightly and highly significantly raised compared with normal, in the first year of the survey. During the second and third years, the mean thresholds declined to normal. Similar but less significant findings were found for protan thresholds. It is concluded that the enhanced safety precautions recently introduced are associated with a recovery of colour vision in this population, demonstrating that any changes to individuals were reversible. Colour vision screening has proved able to detect mild ocular abnormalities due to systemic and congenital disease."

Low-dose (high-dose-rate) X-irradiation inhibits FSTinduced immobility in mice due to its antioxidative function. We evaluated the effects of low-dose gamma-irradiation at a low-dose-rate on the FST-induced depletion of antioxidants in mouse organs. Mice received whole-body low-dose-rate (0.6 or 3.0 mGy/h) of low-dose gamma-irradiation for 1 week, followed by daily FSTs (5 days). The immobility rate on day 2 compared to day 1 was significantly lower in the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice than in sham irradiated mice. The FST significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) activity and total glutathione (t-GSH) content in the brain and kidney, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and t-GSH content in the liver of the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice were significantly lower than those of the non-FST-treated mice. The CAT activity in the lungs of mice exposed to 3.0 mGy/h gamma-irradiation was higher than that of non-FST treated mice and mice treated with FST. However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these antioxidant markers between the sham and irradiated groups except for the CAT activity in lungs.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 108 patients with newly-diagnosed DIPG were treated with conventionally-fractionated radiation therapy (RT) to 54Gy (median) at our institution from 2006 to 2014. The presence and severity of neurological symptoms related to cranial neuropathy (CN) and cerebellar (CB) and long tract (LT) signs prior to and weekly during RT was reviewed for each patient. The incidence and rate of change of each symptom category was evaluated to determine the impact of clinical variables and brain sub-region volumes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULT(S): Median dose to first sign of symptomatic improvement was 16.2Gy (CN), 21.6Gy (CB) and 19.8Gy (LT). Most patients showed any improvement by 20Gy. Black race was associated with improved LT signs at significantly lower cumulative RT doses (P=0.027). Larger uninvolved brainstem volume alone and normalized to total brain (TB) or posterior fossa volume (PF) was associated with a shorter time to LT sign improvement (P=0.044, P=0.033, and P=0.05, respectively). Patients with any improvement in CN experienced significantly prolonged progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.002 and P=0.008, respectively). Tumor volume, with or without normalization to TB or PF, was not significantly associated with PFS or OS. CONCLUSION(S): Low cumulative doses of RT provided neurologic improvement in the majority of patients with DIPG. Brain sub-region volumes influenced time to symptomatic improvement, while neurologic improvement was associated with superior survival outcomes."

Little is known about the impact of lymphangionesis in neuroblastoma. From a surgical point of view, lymphatic fistula is a potential complication after neuroblastoma surgery. Aim of this study was the evaluation of frequency and impact of lymphatic leakage in a center for neuroblastoma surgery. Design/Methods: Between 2003 and 2014, 210 patients (pts) were resected for neuroblastoma in our department for neuroblastoma. Out of these, 200 patients were eligible for this study. Patient charts were reviewed for INSS stage, surgical radicality, duration of abdominal or thoracic drainage and maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h. Result(s): Out of 200 patients, 73 patients (37%) had a duration of drainage of 7 or more days. Maximum amount of drainage was 4 liters per day; longest duration of intraabdominal drainage was 91 days. In case of chylous fistula, all patients were treated with a conservative approach. Duration of drainage was significantly associated with surgical radicality (p=0.000). Furthermore, the duration of drainage was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h (p=0.000). Lymphatic fistula was significantly associated with INSS stage (p=0.000). Overall Survival (OS) demonstrated a better OS for patients without LL (87% alive) than pts with LL (72% alive). OS was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 hrs (p=0.009), but not with duration of drainage. Conclusion(s): LL is a frequent complication after neuroblastoma surgery and in some cases with substantial loss of fluids and proteins. It can be treated in nearly all cases conservatively. One major problem is the delay of further chemotherapy and radiation which however does not seem to have a great impact on the prognosis."

Participants were stratified by stage (IIIA v IIIB), histology (nonsquamous v squamous), and therapy (surgery v none) and were randomly assigned to PCI or observation. PCI was delivered to 30 Gy in 15 fractions. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS), neurocognitive function (NCF), and quality of life. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used for OS and DFS. The incidence of brain metastasis (BM) was evaluated with the logistic regression model.RESULTS: Overall, 356 patients were accrued of the targeted 1,058. The study was closed early because of slow accrual; 340 of the 356 patients were eligible. The 1-year OS (P = .86; 75.6% v 76.9% for PCI v observation) and 1-year DFS (P = .11; 56.4% v 51.2% for PCI v observation) were not significantly different. The hazard ratio for observation versus PCI was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.36). The 1-year rates of BM were significantly different (P = .004; 7.7% v 18.0% for PCI v observation). Patients in the observation arm were 2.52 times more likely to develop BM than those in the PCI arm (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.80).CONCLUSION: In patients with stage III disease without progression of disease after therapy, PCI decreased the rate of BM but did not improve OS or DFS."

Understanding the mechanism of cardiac atrophy under weightlessness is important to help astronaut recover from unloading-induced cardiovascular changes after spaceflight. Unloading-induced changes of hemodynamics, metabolic demands and neurohumoral regulation contribute to cardiac atrophy and function declining. During this process, Ca(2+)-related signaling, NF-kappaB signaling, ERK signaling, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and autophagy are involved in weightlessness-induced cardiac atrophy. This article reviews the underlying mechanism of cardiac atrophy under weightlessness/simulated weightlessness."

Herein, we discuss the prevalence and etiology of three broad categories of oral complications found during the treatment of cancer patients: mucositis, dysgeusia, and infectious disease. Lastly, we present therapeutic options that may be helpful in ameliorating these uncomfortable and, sometimes, life-threatening oral complications."

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the microinflammation after radiotherapy of the neck and the incidence of carotid stenosis. This study reports on patients treated with radiotherapy as part of the treatment for laryngeal cancer in the Department of Radiation Oncology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, P.R. China. Sixty-two males and nine females were treated with radiotherapy between 2006 and 3012. The carotid diameter was determined by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common, external and internal carotid artery. Microinflammatory conditions were assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Other studied risk factors included age, treatment modalities, radiation dose and energy, the height of the radiation field, and follow-up time. Carotid stenosis was detected in all of the 71 patients. It was mainly clinically unsuspected; 19 patients had sustained a vascular event (14 TIA, 5 CVI) at a median of 3.11 years (range 2.3-5.6 years) following RT. In four of five CVI patients, CVI occurred on the side of the irradiation. Eleven patients who suffered vascular incident had severe stenosis of the carotid artery and 6 had moderate (31-49% of the lumen). Only two patients with mild stenosis on the irradiated side suffered TIAs. Serum hs-CRP levels in carotid stenosis were 9.4 (+/-SD=5.97) mg/ml, IL-6 = 12.8 (+/-SD=2.62) pg/ml and TNF-alpha = 15.4 (+/-SD=4.49) ng/ml. The clinical detection of asymptomatic carotid stenosis is challenging, and current recommendations regarding the follow-up period should be scrutinized."

The aggressiveness by isolation in mice has been often used as a means for a better understanding of disturbed behavior in human beings. We found that male ICR white Swiss mice exhibiting isolation-induced aggression became gradually calm and showed remarkably quiet behavior 7 to 10 days after whole body irradiation of very low-dose X-rays (5-15 cGy). Higher doses (25-35 cGy), however, could not induce such effects. We also obtained the data on brain biochemistry giving a further support for the above low-dose effects on the mouse behavior. Brain serotonin turnover which has been known to be related to aggressive behavior in 5 or 15 cGy irradiated mice was faster than in aggressive control animals."
975,Excluded,"Artificial Intelligence is implemented as a tool in the daily workflow on the PET/MRI scanner to create an attenuation map for the correct PET image Introduction: Artificial Intelligence is implemented as a tool in the daily workflow on the PET/MRI scanner to create an attenuation map for the correct PET image. Background(s): A PET/MRI Siemens Biograph mMRI was installed in 2011 and used in the daily routine primarily for dementia patients. The PET/MRI is challenged by lack of a direct measure of photon attenuation correction (AC), for obtaining a correct PET image. The patients previously needed to have a low-dose CT-AC. Ladefoged et al. developed an application based on deep learning model to generate artificial CT images from MR images. The model was trained on more than 1000 patients with both MRI and CT scans. The deep learning model takes images for attenuation correction in reconstructing positron emission tomography (PET/MRI). Since May 2019 Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based MRI-AC has been implemented as a part of the daily workflow. The objective of this study was to share our experiences of the use of AI MRI-AC in clinical practice. Method(s): All patients for dementia evaluation are injected with 200 MBq [18F] FDG, rest for 30 min and imaged with PET/MRI in a protocol consisting of a 10 min single-bed acquisition. The Dixon umap is centered on the brain stem and MRI sequences are focused on structural and vascular pathology. As soon as the Dixon sequence is ready it is sent to a computer node. The AI-method will generate and return a new AC map to be used during reconstruction for the correct attenuated PET image in less than 1 min. AI generated umaps are inspected before use by technologists and accuracy is followed weekly by comparing to a CT based reference. Result(s): Implementing AI in the daily routine for dementia patients on a PET/MRI scanner results in images that are ready to be viewed and described as soon as the patient leaves the scanner. The patients have no need for a CT scan, which saves the patients from extra radiation dose, and saves the staff some challenging time due to handling the immobile dementia patients. Conclusion(s): AI models, if validated for performance, offer several potential benefits to patients as well as technologists. One-stop PET/MRI for dementia patients is quick and together with the AI it is a robust and cost-effective technique for the health care system."

2517,Excluded,"Mechanical allodynia induced by optogenetic sensory nerve excitation activates dopamine signaling and metabolism in medial nucleus accumbens The mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling, such as that originating from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons in the medial part of the nucleus accumbens (mNAc), plays a role in complex sensory and affective components of pain. To date, we have demonstrated that optogenetic sensory nerve stimulation rapidly alters the dopamine (DA) content within the mNAc. However, the physiological role and biochemical processes underlying such rapid and regional dynamics of DA remain unclear. In this study, using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), we observed that sensitized pain stimulation by optogenetic sensory nerve activation increased DA and 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT; a post-synaptic metabolite obtained following DA degradation) in the mNAc of the experimental mice. To delineate the mechanism associated with elevation of DA and 3-MT, the de novo synthesized DA in the VTA/substantia nigra terminal areas was evaluated using IMS by visualizing the metabolic conversion of stable isotope-labeled tyrosine (<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-Tyr) to DA. Our approach revealed that at steady state, the de novo synthesized DA occupied >10% of the non-labeled DA pool in the NAc within 1.5h of isotope-labeled Tyr administration, despite no significant increase following pain stimulation. These results suggested that sensitized pain triggered an increase in the release and postsynaptic intake of DA in the mNAc, followed by its degradation, and likely delayed de novo DA synthesis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that short, peripheral nerve excitation with mechanical stimulation accelerates the mNAc-specific DA signaling and metabolism which might be associated with the development of mechanical allodynia."

The pineal gland of Sprague-Dawley rats housed under a LD regime (n=42) for four weeks and of a regime (n=42) for eight weeks were sampled at six different times, every 4 h (n=7 animals per time point), during a 24 h period. Total RNA was extracted from each sample, and the semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine temporal changes in mRNA levels of Clock and NAT genes during different circadian or zeitgeber times. The data and parameters were analyzed by the cosine function software, Clock Lab software, and the amplitude F test was used to reveal the circadian rhythm. In the DD or LD condition, both the Clock and NAT mRNA levels in the pineal gland showed robust circadian oscillation (p<0.05) with the peak at the subjective night or at nighttime. In comparison with the DD regime, the amplitudes and mRNA levels at the peaks of Clock and NAT expressions in LD in the pineal gland were significantly reduced (p<0.05). In the DD or LD condition, the circadian expressions of NAT were similar in pattern to those of Clock in the pineal gland (p>0.05). These findings indicate that the transcriptions of Clock and NAT genes in the pineal gland not only show remarkably synchronous endogenous circadian rhythmic changes, but also respond to the ambient light signal in a reduced manner."

2799,Included,"Passive avoidance learning and memory of 56Fe sham-irradiated and irradiated human apoE transgenic mice Cranial irradiation is associated with long-term cognitive impairments, including deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4). Compared with epsilon3, epsilon4 increases the risk of cognitive impairments following various challenges while epsilon2 provides relative protection. Women are at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, particularly those carrying epsilon4. In previous experiments using male and female mice expressing human apoE-isoforms E2, E3 or E4 under the mouse apoE promoter, we showed that cranial irradiation with 137Cs (10 Gy) results in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments that are sex- and apoE-isoform dependent. 137Cs is a form of irradiation often used in the clinical setting. To investigate whether 56Fe irradiation also has sex- and apoE-isoform dependent effects on hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in human apoE mice, we sham-irradiated and irradiated 2-month old male and female human apoE mice at 3 Gy and assessed their performance in a passive avoidance learning and memory test three to five months later."

The radiation response was evaluated in terms of regrowth delay; estimates of in situ cell survival were made by back-extrapolation of regrowth curves. These studies showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of single as compared to split dose irradiation i.e. no sparing effect of fractionation.

The application of radiation timing, doses, fraction schedules in this modality and the indication of prophylactic cranial irradiation is recently controversial. In this retrospective study, these subjects were evaluated by considering our patients results. Seventy patients having adequate data for examination with limited-stage SCLC were referred to our clinic in the period between December 1995 and December 2002. The patients were classified according to their response to CT, the dose and timing of RT applications. The effects of obtained variables on overall survival were analyzed. Male/ female ratio was 5/1; and the mean age was 55 years (range 31-80 years). The mean follow-up of all patients was 10 months and the mean survival time was 16 months. An objective (complete and partial) response to CT administered before RT was seen in 47 (67%) patients. The survival time was better in the CT responding patients (median 11 months versus 6 months, p= 0.002). The application of more than 50 Gy radiation dose was found to be ineffective on survival. An improvement in survival was observed in RT application beginning before fourth cycle CT (median 14 months versus 8 months p= 0.01). In despite of the ineffectiveness of prophylactic cranial irradiation on survival is observed in survival analysis, it was found to be a parameter affecting survival in Cox-regression analysis. However the most frequently complication during RT was oesophagitis. Grade III was seen in 1 (3%) patient. The response to CT can be accepted as an indicator for survival. We concluded that the administering of RT in the beginning of CT, not administering radiation doses of more than 50 Gy and the necessity of applying prophylactic cranial irradiation to all patients showing complete response are points to be considered according to our retrospective analysis."
1870,Included,"Gamma radiation (5-10 Gy) impairs neuronal function in the guinea pig hippocampus Guinea pigs were exposed to 5 and 10 Gy gamma radiation. Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner. These persistent changes in neuronal function are likely to be a consequence of the actions of ionizing radiation on the physiological processes that influence the neuronal environment."

Measurement were performed under extreme case scenarios wherein maximum secondary neutrons and photons were produced around CV, BTS and GTR3 by stopping 230MeV proton of 300nA on beam degrader, end of BTS and isocenter of GTR3. Weekly time average dose rate (TADR) were calculated from H*(10) value measured at selective hot spots by irradiating actual treatment plans of mix clinical sites.RESULTS: The maximum total H*(10) were within 2 microSv/hr around CV, 5 microSv/hr around outer wall of BTS which increases up to 62 microSv/hr at the end of inside BTS corridor. Maximum H*(10) of 20.8 microSv/hr in treatment control console (P125), 23.4 microSv/hr behind the common wall between GTR3 and GTR2 (P132) and 25.7 microSv/hr above isocenter (P99) were observed around GTR3. Reduction of beam current from 6 to 3 nA and 1 nA at nozzle exit lead to decrease in total H*(10) at P125 from 20.8 to 11.35 and 4.62 microSv/hr. In comparison to extreme case scenario, H*(10) value at P125, P132 and P99 from clinically relevant irradiation parameters were reduce by a factor ranging from 8.6 for high range cube to 46.4 for brain clinical plan. The maximum weekly TADR per fraction was highest for large volume, sacral chordoma patient at 8.5 microSv/hr compare to 0.3 microSv/hr for brain patient. The calculated weekly TADR for 30 mix clinical cases and 15 fractions of 1 L cube resulted total weekly TADR of 83-84 microSv/hr at P125, P132 and P99. The maximum annual dose level at these hot spots were estimated at 4.37 mSv/Yr.CONCLUSION: We have carried out an extensive measurement of H*(10) under different conditions. The shielding thickness of our PT facility is adequate to limit the dose to occupational worker and general public within the permissible stipulated limit. The data reported here can bridge the knowledge gap in ambient dose around PT facility and can also be used as a reference for any new and existing proton facility for intercomparison and validation.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: First extensive investigation of neutron and photon H*(10) around PT facility and can bridge the knowledge gap on ambient dose."

Material(s) and Method(s): On the basis of advantages of high-energy laser radiation, we developed a method for treating trigeminal neuralgia by means of puncture laser destruction (neurotomy) of peripheral trigeminal branches on different levels. At first, a peripheral branch was blocked; if there was a positive clinical effect in the form of disappearance or significant reduction of a colicky pain, an optical quartz fibre 200-400 nm in diameter was inserted through an internal lumen of an intraneurally placed injection needle. The above quartz optical fibre serves for laser radiation influence with wavelength of 980 nm in a continuous mode using fractional portions by 2-4 seconds with an interval of 8-10 seconds and radiation power from 2 to 7 W until deep or total anaesthesia was achieved in the innervation area of a relevant nerve. Depending upon the diameter of a nerve, from 200 to 600 J were required. If necessary, the position of a needle with an optical fibre was changed, thereby causing a new focus of laser destruction until the required degree of innervation was achieved. During one operation it was possible to carry out laser destruction (neurotomy) of several nerve trunks. Result(s): From April 2011 to May 2012, 30 patients received treatment with use of a method of laser neurotomy of peripheral trigeminal branches. A positive effect was achieved in 27 cases.

2463,Excluded,"Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition delays recurrence of glioblastoma after radiation by altering myeloid cell recruitment and polarization BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) may initially respond to treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), but the prognosis remains extremely poor because the tumors invariably recur. Using animal models, we previously showed that inhibiting stromal cell-derived factor 1 signaling can prevent or delay GBM recurrence by blocking IR-induced recruitment of myeloid cells, specifically monocytes that give rise to tumor-associated macrophages. The present study was aimed at determining if inhibiting colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) signaling could be used as an alternative strategy to target pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells recruited to irradiated GBM.METHODS: To inhibit CSF-1 signaling in myeloid cells, we used PLX3397, a small molecule that potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Combined IR and PLX3397 therapy was compared with IR alone using 2 different human GBM intracranial xenograft models.RESULTS: GBM xenografts treated with IR upregulated CSF-1R ligand expression and increased the number of CD11b+ myeloid-derived cells in the tumors. Treatment with PLX3397 both depleted CD11b+ cells and potentiated the response of the intracranial tumors to IR. Median survival was significantly longer for mice receiving combined therapy versus IR alone. Analysis of myeloid cell differentiation markers indicated that CSF-1R inhibition prevented IR-recruited monocyte cells from differentiating into immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages.CONCLUSION: CSF-1R inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve GBM response to radiotherapy."

Their fibroblasts were cultured and their radiation sensitivity tested to determine the SF2 for each patient. Results. - Patients who developed a neurological complication from radionecrosis, secondary to radiosurgery had an SF2 different than the two control patients with AVM and no complications and also from a group of five cancer patients without late radiation complications (P = 0.005). Conclusion. - Radiosurgery is an elective procedure. The identification of a subgroup of patients who are radiosensitive and at a higher risk of radiation induced complications can allow the treatment team to reduce the risk of such complications.

201,Excluded,"MMP-2 siRNA inhibits radiation-enhanced invasiveness in glioma cells BACKGROUND: Our previous work and that of others strongly suggests a relationship between the infiltrative phenotype of gliomas and the expression of MMP-2. Radiation therapy, which represents one of the mainstays of glioma treatment, is known to increase cell invasion by inducing MMP-2. Thus, inhibition of MMP-2 provides a potential means for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy for malignant glioma.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have tested the ability of a plasmid vector-mediated MMP-2 siRNA (p-MMP-2) to modulate ionizing radiation-induced invasive phenotype in the human glioma cell lines U251 and U87. Cells that were transfected with p-MMP-2 with and without radiation showed a marked reduction of MMP-2 compared to controls and pSV-transfected cells. A significant reduction of proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of cells transfected with p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation was observed compared to controls. Western blot analysis revealed that radiation-enhanced levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, pVEGFR-2, p-FAK, and p-p38 were inhibited with p-MMP-2-transfected cells. TUNEL staining showed that radiation did not induce apoptosis in U87 and U251 cells while a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells was observed when irradiated cells were simultaneously transfected with p-MMP-2 as compared to controls. Intracranial tumor growth was predominantly inhibited in the animals treated with p-MMP-2 alone or in combination with radiation compared to controls.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: MMP-2 inhibition, mediated by p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation, significantly reduced tumor cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating several important downstream signaling molecules and directing cells towards apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate the efficacy of p-MMP-2 in inhibiting radiation-enhanced tumor invasion and progression and suggest that it may act as a potent adjuvant for radiotherapy in glioma patients."
1623,Excluded,"Focal brain lesions induced with ultraviolet irradiation Lesion and inactivation methods have played important roles in neuroscience studies. However, traditional techniques for creating a brain lesion are highly invasive, and control of lesion size and shape using these techniques is not easy. Here, we developed a novel method for creating a lesion on the cortical surface via 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation without breaking the dura mater. We demonstrated that 2.0 mWh UV irradiation, but not the same amount of non-UV light irradiation, induced an inverted bell-shaped lesion with neuronal loss and accumulation of glial cells. Moreover, the volume of the UV irradiation-induced lesion depended on the UV light exposure amount. We further succeeded in visualizing the lesioned site in a living animal using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Importantly, we also observed using an optical imaging technique that the spread of neural activation evoked by adjacent cortical stimulation disappeared only at the UV-irradiated site. In summary, UV irradiation can induce a focal brain lesion with a stable shape and size in a less invasive manner than traditional lesioning methods. This method is applicable to not only neuroscientific lesion experiments but also studies of the focal brain injury recovery process."

A case-control study in long-term survivors from cancer in the head and neck region BACKGROUND: Adult patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders have compromised quality of life (QoL). Whether this is due to their endocrine consequences (hypopituitarism), their underlying hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or both is still under debate. The aim of this trial was to measure quality of life (QoL) in long-term cancer survivors who have received a radiation dose to the basal part of the brain and the pituitary.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=101) treated for oropharyngeal or epipharyngeal cancer with radiotherapy followed free of cancer for a period of 4 to10 years were identified. Fifteen patients (median age 56 years) with no concomitant illness and no hypopituitarism after careful endocrine evaluation were included in a case-control study with matched healthy controls. Doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary region were calculated. QoL was assessed using the Symptom check list (SCL)-90, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and Psychological Well Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Level of physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire.RESULTS: The median accumulated dose was 1.9 Gy (1.5-2.2 Gy) to the hypothalamus and 2.4 Gy (1.8-3.3 Gy) to the pituitary gland in patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 6.0-9.3 Gy and 33.5-46.1 Gy, respectively in patients with epipharyngeal cancer (n=2). The patients showed significantly more anxiety and depressiveness, and lower vitality, than their matched controls.CONCLUSION: In a group of long time survivors of head and neck cancer who hade received a low radiation dose to the hypothalamic-pituitary region and who had no endocrine consequences of disease or its treatment QoL was compromised as compared with well matched healthy controls."
414,Included,"Impaired Attentional Set-Shifting Performance after Exposure to 5 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si Particles Astronauts on deep space missions will be required to work more autonomously than on previous missions, and thus their ability to perform executive functions could be critical to mission success. One of the most common measures of executive function in humans is the ability to perform attentional set shifting, which requires contributions from working memory, discrimination, reversal learning, attentional set shifting and attention. Rodent attentional set shifting assays require rats to form an association between the presence of the food reward and an associative cue, which is either the digging media or the scent that is placed in the bowl; by altering the combination of scent and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. In this study, we have determined the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si particles has on the ability of male retired breeder Wistar rats to perform attentional set shifting at three months postirradiation. All doses of Si resulted in a significant impairment in the ability of the rats to perform the first and most simple step of the ATSET assay, the simple discrimination (SD) task. If astronauts were to experience HZE-induced SD impairments, they would be unable to identify key factors to successfully resolve a situation. Performance in at least one other component of the ATSET test was impaired at all doses studied, however, these varied according to the dose. Compared with our previous studies using 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>48</sup>Ti particles, 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si ions impaired attentional set-shifting performance at lower doses than the heavier ions. However, when the effect of isofluences of the three HZE ions were compared, there were no significant differences in the severity of the impaired performance; there were, however, ion-specific decrements in the ability of rats to perform within the various stages of the test. This study further supports the notion that ""mission-relevant"" doses of HZE particles (<20 cGy) can impair certain aspects of attentional set-shifting performance in retired breeder rats, but there may be some ion-specific changes in the specific cognitive domains impaired."
2130,Excluded,"Effects of escitalopram challenge on white matter integrity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and healthy controls Background: Involvement of the serotonergic system in OCD is well-known, with OCD responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Chronic use of SSRIs changes brain connectivity in OCD, and a single dose of an SSRI dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the brain in healthy subjects. The question is raised whether acute administration of an SSRI can also significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of patients with OCD. Method(s): OCD patients (n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=24) received a single dose of escitalopram 20mg on one day, and a single dose of placebo on another day, in randomized order, under double-blind conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to compare white matter integrity of the whole brain between the groups. The impact of the SSRI challenge on white matter in these two study groups were subsequently investigated, controlling for age. Result(s): There were no significant interaction effects (diagnostic group x pharmacological challenge) or effects in the OCD group separately. In controls, the escitalopram challenge had a significant impact on white matter diffusivity of the left post thalamic radiation (PTR-L) (F=7.84; p=0.01), the superior corona radiata bilaterally (SCR: F=7.99; p=0.01) and the sagittal stratum bilaterally (SS: F=6.64; p=0.02). In these tracts, FA was significantly higher and RD significantly lower after the pharmacological challenge compared to placebo. Discussion(s): Acute administration of an SSRI did not significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of OCD patients. It did however improve white matter integrity in tracts that connect regions that may be affected in OCD, in controls. DTI-derived parameters are differently affected in OCD and healthy controls, respectively, in structures within the fronto-striatothalamo-cortical loop after chronic SSRI treatment. Alteration of white matter integrity may occur in OCD with longer treatment duration or at a different dosage with plasticity potentially playing a role."
2333,Included,"Mitochondrial Degeneration and Autophagy Associated With Delayed Effects of Radiation in the Mouse Brain Mitochondria are linked with various radiation responses, including mitophagy, genomic instability, apoptosis, and the bystander effect. Mitochondria play an important role in preserving cellular homeostasis during stress responses, and dysfunction in mitochondrial contributes to aging, carcinogenesis and neurologic diseases. In this study, we have investigated the mitochondrial degeneration and autophagy in the hippocampal region of brains from mice administered with BBT-059, a long-acting interleukin-11 analog, or its formulation buffer 24 h prior to irradiation at different radiation doses collected at 6 and 12 months post-irradiation. The results demonstrated a higher number of degenerating mitochondria in 12 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 6 months and 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 12 months as compared to the age-matched naive (non-irradiated control animals). Apg5l, Lc3b and Sqstm1 markers were used to analyze the autophagy in the brain, however only the Sqstm1 marker exhibited significantly reduced expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to naive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of Bcl2 also demonstrated a decrease in expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to other groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure."
1182,Excluded,"Combination of TMS and fMRI reveals a specific pattern of reorganization in M1 in patients after complete spinal cord injury PURPOSE: After a spinal cord injury (SCI), which was complete, deafferentation of the body representation caudal to the lesion height results in drastic changes in the cortical representation. The underlaying processes are poorly understood.METHODS: We investigated cortical representation sites of upper limb muscles using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in five patients suffering from thoracic complete SCI and one with an incomplete SCI in the height of L1.RESULTS: In comparison to healthy controls fMRI demonstrated a displacement of elbow movement representations in the precentral gyrus in patients with complete SCI into the direction of the deafferented cortical thoracic representation. Changes increased with time after the incidence of SCI. TMS revealed reduced excitability and prolonged silent periods for muscles more distant to the deafferented area.CONCLUSIONS: Whereas fMRI demonstrated changes in representation sites adjacent to the deafferented area, TMS excitability changes were also observed more distant to the deafferented area and silent periods were prolonged in comparison to healthy controls. TMS changes might depend on both: the distance to the deafferented area and the time of persistence of deafferentation."
2823,Excluded,"Evidence that tRNA synthetase-directed proton transfer stops mistranslation To prevent mistranslation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) discriminate against noncognate amino acids and cellular metabolites. Defects in specificity produce statistical proteins which, in mammalian cells, lead to activation of the unfolded protein response and cell death. Because of inherent limitations in amino acid discrimination by a single active site, AARSs evolved a separate domain to clear mischarged amino acids. Although the structure of a widely distributed editing domain for ThrRS and AlaRS is known, the mechanism of amino acid clearance remains elusive. This domain has two motifs that together have four conserved residues in the pocket used to clear serine from mischarged tRNAs. Here, using ThrRS as an example, rapid single-turnover kinetics, mutagenesis, and solvent isotope analysis show that a strictly conserved histidine (between ThrRS and AlaRS) extracts a proton in the chemical step of the editing reaction. Three other conserved residues, and two additional residues in the editing pocket, are not directly implicated in the chemical step. These results are relevant to the previously reported mutagenesis of the homologous editing pocket of alanyl-tRNA synthetase, where even a mild defect in editing causes neurodegeneration in the mouse. Thus, a single proton-transfer event needed to prevent mistranslation can have profound implications for disease."
1263,Excluded,"Mechanisms of action for an anti-radiation vaccine in reducing the biological impact of high dose and dose-rate, low-linear energy transfer radiation exposure The development of an anti-radiation vaccine could be very useful in reducing acute radiation syndromes. Existing principles for the treatment of acute radiation syndromes are based on the amelioration of progressive pathophysiological changes, using the concept of replacement therapy. Active immunization by small quantities of the essential radiation-induced systemic toxins of what we call the Specific Radiation Determinant (SRD) before irradiation increased duration of life among animals that were irradiated by lethal or sub-lethal doses of gamma-radiation. The SRD toxins possess antigenic properties that are specific to different forms of acute radiation sickness. Intramuscular injection of larger quantities of the SRD toxins induce signs and symptoms in irradiated naive animals similar to those observed in acute radiation syndromes, including death. Providing passive immunization, at variable periods of time following radiation, with preparations of immune-globulins directed at the SRD molecules, can confer some protection in the development of clinical sequelae in irradiated animals. Improved survival rates and times were observed in animals that received lower, sublethal doses of the same SRDs prior to irradiation. Therefore, active immunization can be induced by SRD molecules as a prophylaxis. The protective effects of the immunization begin to manifest 15-35 days after an injection of a biologically active SDR preparation. The SRD molecules are a group of radiation toxins with antigenic properties that correlate specifically with different forms of radiation disease. The SRD molecules are composed of glycoproteins and lipoproteins that accumulate in the lymphatic system of mammals in the first hours after irradiation, and preliminary analysis suggests that they may originate from cellular membrane components. The molecular weight of the SRD group ranges from 200-250 kDa. The SRD molecules were isolated from the lymphatic systems of laboratory animals that were irradiated with doses known to induce the development of cerebral (SRD-1), non-specific toxic effects (SRD-2), gastrointestinal (SRD-3) and hematological (bone marrow) (SRD-4) syndromes. Our results suggest that an anti-radiation vaccine can be developed for prophylactic use against radiation damage induced by acute exposure to significant doses of low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation for humans, including nuclear power workers, commercial and military pilots, cosmonauts/astronauts, nuclear-powered engine vessel operators and possibly even the civilian population in the case of a nuclear terrorism event."

The exposure to microwaves of high intensity stimulated basal LPO but suppressed activity of LPO-inducing systems. This suggests disturbances in the activity of different sources of active oxygen forms. Microwaves of low intensity activated systems of induced LPO. This is accompanied with synchronous activity of the antioxidant defense system maintaining a normal oxidation-reduction balance of the cell. The conclusion is that, depending on their intensity, microwaves can be either beneficial to health or be a factor of oxidative stress."
525,Excluded,"Neural circuits underlying circadian behavior in Drosophila melanogaster Circadian clocks include control systems for organizing daily behavior. Such a system consists of a time-keeping mechanism (the clock or pacemaker), input pathways for entraining the clock, and output pathways for producing overt rhythms in behavior and physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in mammals, neural circuits play vital roles in all three functional subdivisions of the circadian system. Regarding the pacemaker, multiple clock neurons, each with cell-autonomous pacemaker capability, are coupled to each other in a network. The outputs of different sets of clock neurons in this network combine to produce the normal bimodal pattern of locomotor activity observed in Drosophila. Regarding input, multiple sensory modalities (including light, temperature, and pheromones) use their own circuitry to entrain the clock. Regarding output, distinct circuits are likely involved for controlling the timing of eclosion and for generating the locomotor activity rhythms. This review summarizes work on all of these circadian circuits, and discusses the broader utility of studying the fly's circadian system. [References: 118]"

The physician's role may include informing the patient of the diagnosis, helping with decisions about treatment, providing psychological support, treating intercurrent disease, continuing patient-appropriate preventive care, and recognizing and managing or comanaging complications of cancer and cancer therapies. Adverse effects of therapy and cancer-related symptoms include nausea, febrile neutropenia, pain, fatigue, depression, and emotional distress. 5-Hydroxytryptamine antagonists are effective in controlling acute nausea associated with chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia requires systematic evaluation and early empiric antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Cancer-related pain, depression, and fatigue often are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Use of brief screening tools for assessing fatigue and emotional distress can improve management of these symptoms. Exercise prescription, activity management, and psychosocial interventions are useful in treating cancer-related fatigue.

During treatment, the patient's head is immobilized independently of the radiotherapy couch and is precisely positioned without reference to room lasers or light field. A precise verification of alignment precedes each treatment. Extensive performance tests have shown that a target, localized by CT, can be irradiated with a positional accuracy of 2.4 mm in any direction with 95% confidence.

Twelve of the patients were also enrolled in the RTOG 0614 trial, which randomized patients to the use of placebo or memantine. After the unblinding of the treatments received by RTOG 0614 patients, DCE-MRI measures of tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) vascular permeability (Initial Area Under the Curve (AUC) Blood Adjusted) was analyzed. Cognitive, quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and blood samples were collected according to the patient's ability to tolerate the exams. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Following WBRT, there was an increasing trend in the vascular permeability of tumors (p=0.09) and NAWM (p=0.06) with time. Memantine significantly (p=0.01) reduced NAWM AUC changes following radiotherapy. Patients on memantine retained (COWA p= 0.03) better cognitive functions than those on placebo. No association was observed between the level of CEC and DCE-MRI changes, time from radiotherapy or memantine use.CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI can detect vascular damage secondary to WBRT. Our data suggests that memantine reduces WBRT-induced brain vasculature damages."

Long-term oncologic control outcomes have been previously reported. This study represents the largest series reporting long-term toxicity profiles after SSRS. Materials/Methods: From December 2002 to June 2011, 228 patients with 261 segments were treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic disease. A subset cohort of 53 patients with 59 segments survived a minimum of 4 years after treatment and was analyzed for radiation associated toxicity. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 were used to grade myelopathy, myelitis, radiculopathy, and fracture. Toxicity endpoints occurring in the setting of tumor progression were not attributed to treatment effect. Toxicity development was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Patients were followed clinically and radiographically for a median of 5.6 years (range 49-110 months). SSRS fractionation schemes were 24 Gy in 1 fraction (25%), 18 Gy in 1 fraction (19%), 27 Gy in 3 fractions (32%), 30 Gy in 5 fractions (11%), 16 Gy in 1 fraction (11%), or 22 Gy in 1 fraction (2%). There were 6 sites treated which received prior conventional radiation (10.2%). Three patients (5%) required additional surgery due to tumor progression while 8 (13.6%) received additional palliative radiation. Long-term treatment related toxicity events included one case of Grade 4 myelopathy resulting in hemi-cord syndrome (1.7%), which occurred 13 months after therapy. Sensory radiculopathy occurred in 5 cases (8.5%) at a median of 12.8 months (range 2.5-25.4), of which, 2 required intrathecal pain pumps for symptom management. Eight treated segments (13.6%) involving 7 patients developed vertebral body collapse and/or endplate fracture at a median 7.5 months (range 0.6-49.2) with 6 (10.2%) requiring either percutaneous vertebroplasty or surgery. Overall, in this subset cohort of long-term survivors, a toxicity event was observed in 15 cases (25%) of which 9 (15%) were at least grade 3. The majority of events (53%) were vertebral fracture. Forty percent of toxicity occurred beyond 12 months of therapy (median 10 months) with events being observed beyond 2 years (radiculopathy) and even 4 years (vertebral fracture) later. Combined grade 3+ neurological toxicity occurred in 5.6% of long-term survivors at a median of 12.7 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Spine stereotactic radiosurgery appears to have a favorable late toxicity profile even amongst a selected cohort of long-term survivors. The overwhelming majority of events occur within 2 years of treatment. Very late toxicity beyond 4 years occurred in 1/59 treated sites and consisted of a vertebral body fracture. There were no very late neurological toxicities beyond 4 years. Overall, these data support the durable safety of the technique."
1194,Excluded,"Role of the Toll Like receptor (TLR) radical cycle in chronic inflammation: possible treatments targeting the TLR4 pathway Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex, a receptor of the innate immune system, may underpin the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including asthma, cardiovascular disorder, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disorders, neuroinflammatory disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, clinical depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, alcohol abuse, and toluene inhalation. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. Here we focus on the environmental factors, which are known to trigger TLR4, e.g., ozone, atmosphere particulate matter, long-lived reactive oxygen intermediate, pentachlorophenol, ionizing radiation, and toluene. Activation of the TLR4 pathways may cause chronic inflammation and increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and oxidative and nitrosative stress and therefore TLR-related diseases. This implies that drugs or substances that modify these pathways may prevent or improve the abovementioned diseases. Here we review some of the most promising drugs and agents that have the potential to attenuate TLR-mediated inflammation, e.g., anti-LPS strategies that aim to neutralize LPS (synthetic anti-LPS peptides and recombinant factor C) and TLR4/MyD88 antagonists, including eritoran, CyP, EM-163, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 6-shogaol, cinnamon extract, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, and molecular hydrogen.

Patients were treated with pituitary surgery and/or irradiation, with and without the addition of drugs. Patients treated with drugs alone were not included. Following combined surgery, radiotherapy and bromocriptine therapy only two acromegalic patients had persistently raised growth hormone levels and five continued to be hyperprolactinaemic. Pituitary irradiation alone was associated with the development of hypothyroidism in three of eight patients. A delayed but significant fall in free thyroxine index (p less than 0.01) was noted in patients receiving 4500 cGy radiotherapy and surgery. Four patients also developed delayed ACTH deficiency at times varying from one to six years after treatment.

Among many other singular advantages, this nonlinear optical approach to measuring membrane potential does not activate light sensitive cells or cell suspensions and cellular networks surrounded with photolyzable molecules. To demonstrate this capability we show that the technique can be applied to living photoreceptor cells that are very sensitive to visible light.

Materials: In this prospective study, 9 patients with CT or MR imaging of the aorta underwent diagnostic neuroangiography with AR guidance from June to August 2017. Before each procedure, segmentation software was used to create a 3D model of the patient's aortic arch including carotid and vertebral arteries. The model was deployed to HoloLens (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), a stereoscopic optical see-Through AR head-worn display. Using the AR user interface we developed, physicians manipulated a virtual 3D model intraoperatively via voice commands, gaze, and gestures while maintaining sterility. In total, 6 physicians completed 14 postoperative questionnaires assessing the system. 18 casematched retrospective controls were identified by screening for age, aorta imaging, cone-beam CT, indication, physician, and OR.

Although many compounds have been reported to affect the formation of amyloid fibrils and/or other types of protein aggregates, the mechanisms by which they act are not well understood. A large number of compounds appear to act in a nonspecific way affecting several different amyloidogenic proteins. We describe here a detailed study of the mechanism of action of one representative compound, lacmoid, in the context of the inhibition of the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show that lacmoid binds Abeta(1-40) in a surfactant-like manner and counteracts the formation of all types of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates. On the basis of these and previous findings, we are able to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of action of nonspecific modulators of protein self-assembly in terms of hydrophobic attraction and the conformational preferences of the polypeptide."
1014,Excluded,"Evaluation of Lower-Dose Spiral Head CT for Detection of Intracranial Findings Causing Neurologic Deficits BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the frequent use of unenhanced head CT for the detection of acute neurologic deficit, the radiation dose for this exam varies widely. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of lower-dose head CT for detection of intracranial findings resulting in acute neurologic deficit.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Projection data from 83 patients undergoing unenhanced spiral head CT for suspected neurologic deficits were collected. Cases positive for infarction, intra-axial hemorrhage, mass, or extra-axial hemorrhage required confirmation by histopathology, surgery, progression of findings, or corresponding neurologic deficit; cases negative for these target diagnoses required negative assessments by two neuroradiologists and a clinical neurologist. A routine dose head CT was obtained using 250 effective mAs and iterative reconstruction. Lower-dose configurations were reconstructed (25-effective mAs iterative reconstruction, 50-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection). Three neuroradiologists circled findings, indicating diagnosis, confidence (0-100), and image quality. The difference between the jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit at routine and lower-dose configurations was estimated. A lower 95% CI estimate of the difference greater than -0.10 indicated noninferiority.RESULTS: Forty-two of 83 patients had 70 intracranial findings (29 infarcts, 25 masses, 10 extra- and 6 intra-axial hemorrhages) at routine head CT (CT dose index = 38.3 mGy). The routine-dose jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.93). Noninferiority was shown for 100-effective mAs iterative reconstruction (figure of merit difference, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.004) and 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.02; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02) but not for 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02) or lower-dose levels. Image quality was better at higher-dose levels and with iterative reconstruction (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Observer performance for dose levels using 100-200 eff mAs was noninferior to that observed at 250 effective mAs with iterative reconstruction, with iterative reconstruction preserving noninferiority at a mean CT dose index of 15.2 mGy."
165,Excluded,"Differential target dependence in the developing brain: implications for mental retardation During development of the brain, many neurons exhibit a dependence on other neuronal populations for their survival and differentiation (target dependence). Evidence suggests that some neural pathways are much more dependent on single target neuronal populations for their survival than are others (differential target dependence). This phenomenon has important implications both for animal models of congenital human brain damage and for ideas concerning the aetiology of behavioural abnormalities associated with human mental retardation. Predictions of the neuronal deficits likely to arise from exposure to cytotoxic agents (e.g. ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, viral infection) at a particular time must take differential target dependence into account. It is known that target dependence affects corticopetal pathways involved with the discriminative senses (e.g. vision), more than monoaminergic and cholinergic corticopetal pathways which are believed to be involved with arousal, selective sensory attention, sleep, memory and cortical vasomotor function. Following prenatal damage to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, this effect of differential target dependence leads not only to a relative hyperinnervation of the cortex with monoaminergic and cholinergic projections, but a specific deficit in visual pathways. The implications of this combined deficit for the behaviour and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded are considered."
12,Excluded,"High levels of enhanced reactivation of herpes simplex virus in skin fibroblasts from various hereditary cancer-prone syndromes The dose response of the enhanced reactivation (ER) of herpes simplex virus type 1 has been studied in UV-irradiated normal human skin fibroblasts and fibroblasts from the following hereditary cancer-prone syndromes: retinoblastoma, aniridia, polyposis coli, neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2, dysplastic nevus syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and Bloom's syndrome. Surprisingly, much higher levels of ER were observed in all these genetically heterogeneous hereditary disorders than in normal human skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that loss of one allele of putative tumor suppressor genes may activate cellular processes that result in the induction of the ER response, and they support our previous observation suggesting that ER may somehow be related to the process of carcinogenesis (P. J. Abrahams et al., Cancer Res., 48: 6054-6057, 1988)."

SMF effects were evaluated in two sets of control and SMF-exposed rats. One set of animals was used for evaluation of SMF potential effects on emotional behaviors in the elevated plus maze and in the open field. The other set of animals was tested for learning and memory abilities in different procedures of the Morris water maze task. We found no significant difference between control and SMF-exposed rats in anxiety tests. However, the ratio of open arms time in the plus maze was reduced by half in SMF-exposed rats. In the Morris water maze, SMF-exposed rats were partially impaired during the initial learning task as well as in the retention task at one week. We conclude that static magnetic field exposure altered emotional behaviors in the plus maze and led to cognitive impairments, or at least to substantial attention disorders, in the Morris water maze."
2136,Excluded,"Melatonin secretion following brain midline irradiation is diminished, but not correlated with subjective sleep disturbances Objective: Cranial irradiation for brain tumours or leukaemias has been related to cognitive, endocrine and psychosocial late effects as well as sleep disturbances and increased daytime sleepiness. Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Thirty-eight adults. Measurements: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. Result(s): Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.

The Elekta Synergy S with dissociated simultaneous multiple port (dose islands) within a single field. This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique."
258,Excluded,"Microstructural white matter correlates of motor fatigue in multiple sclerosis-a diffusion weighted imaging study Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). It contributes significantly to reduced quality of life. Some studies suggest that fatigue is a consequence of microstructural disease alterations in specific white matter (WM) tracts - e.g., right anterior thalamic radiation (rATR) (Bester 2013, Gobbi 2014). However, others have not been able to find any associations between WM changes and fatigue. Consequently, the role of microstructural WM changes in the pathophysiology of fatigue remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between WM microstructural brain pathology and motor fatigue in MS. Method(s): We included 50 mildly disabled relapsing remitting MS patients from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Centre and 25 age -and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Fatigue was evaluated with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Additionally, all participants underwent a standard MS test-battery and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination including conventional scans and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). i) The local microstructural brain structures were assessed with fractional anisotropy (FA) for detecting the voxelwise indicating indices of WM abnormalities compared to HC. ii) The disruption of neural fibres connecting specific brain areas was assessed with anatomical connectivity mapping (ACM), which reflects the strength of connectedness of each WM voxel to the entire brain (Lyksborg 2014). iii) We also assessed the correlation between fatigue scores and MS-related WM pathology. Result(s): Relative to HC, MS patients showed reduced FA and ACM in the body of the corpus callosum (CC) containing motor fibres (p< 0.001 and p=0.022 respectively, FWE corrected at the cluster level). We did not find statistically significant correlations between motor fatigue and microstructural disease alterations in rATR (p>0.900) (extracted with the JHU White-Matter Tractography Atlas) or using a whole brain white-matter mask (p>0.706). Conclusion(s): The microstructure in the body of CC, including the transcallosal motor fibres, was significantly altered in the MS group relative to HC. This suggests that individuals with MS have a changed interhemispheric connectivity in the commissural motor fibres. Since we found no association between regional WM microstructure and fatigue, our data do not support the notion that a local structural WM change may be critical for the emergence of fatigue in MS."

Despite this, incurable distant metastases develop within 5 years in 15% of men with very high-risk features. Darolutamide is a structurally distinct oral androgen receptor antagonist with low blood-brain-barrier penetration, a demonstrated favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of adding darolutamide to ADT and RT in the setting of either primary definitive therapy, or adjuvant therapy for very high-risk PC. Method(s): This study is a randomized (1:1) phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for men planned for RT who have very high-risk localized PC; or very high-risk features with PSA persistence or rise within one year following RP. The trial will be stratified by: RP; use of adjuvant docetaxel; pelvic nodal involvement. 1100 participants will be randomized to darolutamide 600 mg or placebo twice daily for 96 weeks. Participants will receive LHRHA for 96 weeks, plus RT starting week 8-24 from randomisation. Participants are allowed nonsteroidal antiandrogen (up to 90 days) in addition to LHRHA up until randomisation. Early treatment with up to 6 cycles of docetaxel completed at least 4 weeks prior to RT is permitted. The primary endpoint is metastasis-free survival (ICECaP-validated), with secondary endpoints overall survival, PC-specific survival, PSA-progression free survival, time to subsequent hormonal therapy, time to castrationresistance, frequency and severity of adverse events, health related quality of life, fear of recurrence. Tertiary endpoints include incremental cost-effectiveness, and identification of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of treatment response, safety and resistance to study treatment."
249,Excluded,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutant protein activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase in response to ionizing radiation Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder with pleiotropic phenotypes, including neuronal degeneration, immune dysfunction, premature ageing and increased cancer risk. The gene mutated in AT, ATM, encodes a putative lipid or protein kinase. Most of the human AT patient phenotypes are recapitulated in Atm-deficient mice. Cells derived from Atm-/- mice, like those from AT patients, exhibit abnormal response to ionizing radiation. One of the known responses to ionizing radiation is the activation of a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene. Ionizing radiation does not activate c-Abl in cells from AT patients or in thymocytes or fibroblasts from the Atm-deficient mice. Ectopic expression of a functional ATM kinase domain corrects this defect, as it phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro at Ser 465, leading to the activation of c-Abl. A mutant c-Abl with Ser 465 changed to Ala 465 is not activated by ionizing radiation or ATM kinase in vivo. These findings identify the c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a downstream target of phosphorylation and activation by the ATM kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation."

Material(s) and Method(s): From July 2012 to October 2013, this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant prospective study included 51 patients with breast cancer (50 women; mean age, 56 years; range, 32-76 years; one man; aged 70 years) who completed PET/MR imaging with diffusion-weighted and contrast material-enhanced sequences after unenhanced PET/CT. Written informed consent for study participation was obtained. Two independent readers for each modality recorded site and number of lesions. Imaging and clinical follow-up, with consensus in two cases, served as the reference standard. Result(s): There were 242 distant metastatic lesions in 30 patients, 18 breast cancers in 17 patients, and 19 positive axillary nodes in eight patients. On a per-patient basis, PET/MR imaging with diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced sequences depicted distant (30 of 30 [100%] for readers 1 and 2) and axillary (eight of eight [100%] for reader 1, seven of eight [88%] for reader 2) metastatic disease at rates similar to those of unenhanced PET/CT (distant metastatic disease: 28 of 29 [96%] for readers 3 and 4, P = .50; axillary metastatic disease: seven of eight [88%] for readers 3 and 4, P. .99) and outperformed PET/CT in the detection of breast cancer (17 of 17 [100%] for readers 1 and 2 vs 11 of 17 [65%] for reader 3 and 10 of 17 [59%] for reader 4; P<.001).

2898,Excluded,"Surgical management of recurrent Rathke's cleft cysts Objective: Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs) are benign epithelial lesions of the sellar region, frequently treated with cyst fenestration and drainage, via a transsphenoidal craniotomy (TSC) approach. While these lesions are benign, they have an appreciable recurrence rate. At present, the literature contains limited data regarding factors contributing to recurrence in patients treated for recurrent cysts. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective analysis of pathology-confirmed RCCs from 1995 to 2016 in our institutional database. TSC for cyst fenestration and drainage was our first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with open craniotomy or radiation as a salvage therapy. Result(s): We identified 112 surgeries for RCC in 101 patients. The mean age of patients presenting for reoperation was significantly higher than for patients presenting for their first operation (42.4 +/- 17 years vs. 58.6 +/- 17 years, p < 0.001). Ninety-one surgeries (80.5%) were primary operations and 21 surgeries in 18 patients (19.5%) were reoperations. Of the 91 patients who underwent their first operation at our institution, eight (8.7%) required reoperation for recurrence. Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak repair was performed in 53% of cases and was more common in reoperation cases (71 vs. 48%, p < 0.04). There were no new neurological deficits or perioperative deaths; however, one patient developed an internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm requiring endovascular treatment. Two patients (9.5%) in the reoperation group developed a postoperative CSF leak, one of which resolved with lumbar drain and one of which required a reoperation. Of the 16 reoperation patients for whom data were available, 11/16 (68.6%) were on pituitary hormone supplementation prior to their reoperations, and 6/16 (37.5%) had diabetes insipidus (DI) requiring desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) at home. Of the 10 reoperation patients without DI prior to revision, the rates of transient hyponatremia (3/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.04) and transient DI (5/10 vs. 17/91, p=0.04) were significantly higher in the reoperation group. The rate of new permanent DI was not higher for reoperation patients (2/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.001). At the last clinical follow-up, 15% of patients reported worsened headaches, 52% reported unchanged headaches, and 33% reported improvement. Of the patients with visual deficits prior to surgery, 61.5% of patients reported improved vision, 30.8% of patients reported stable vision, and 7.7% of patients reported worsening of vision. RCC recurrence developed in 7/45 patients (15.6%) <40 years of age, compared with 22/64 patients (34.4%) =40 years of age (p < 0.04). Recurrence was observed in 4/10 RCCs (40%) with squamous metaplasia compared with 25/99 (25.2%) patients without squamous metaplasia (p=0.45). Recurrence was observed in 4/12 RCCs (33.3%) with inflammation which was not statistically different from the rates of recurrence in patients without inflammation 25/97 (25.7%, p=0.73). Conclusion(s): Reoperation for recurrent RCC is a safe and effective intervention for patients with recurrent visual symptoms or headaches. Many patients present with hypopituitarism, thus care should be taken to ensure adequate hormonal supplementation in the perioperative period. Additionally, patients should be counseled that hormonal recovery is unlikely and additional hormonal supplementation may be required following reoperation. RCCs show an appreciable recurrence rate and require fastidious long-term follow-up."
144,Excluded,"Radiation-Induced Optic Neuropathy: Clinical and Imaging Profile of Twelve Patients BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RON) is a form of delayed radionecrosis of the anterior visual pathways, which develops within months to years after external cranial irradiation and causes severe and irreversible vision loss. Small series reports have adequately documented its clinical features, but imaging characteristics have been less completely described.METHODS: We accrued cases from the University of Michigan Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic files and from cases coded as ""radiation optic neuropathy"" at the University of Michigan Medical Center between 1994 and 2017. All patients had undergone 3D-conformal linear accelerator (photon) external beam radiation. We collected clinical details of vision loss, including the temporal relationship to radiation. A single neuroradiologist (E.A.L.) evaluated all available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, noting the presence of enhancement, expansion, or volume loss of the optic nerves or chiasm, corresponding T2 signal abnormalities, and the absence of demyelination or confounding compressive lesions.RESULTS: Twelve patients (15 eyes) met inclusion criteria. Vision loss was usually monocular at outset, but both optic nerves were eventually involved in 3 (25%) patients. Although usually sudden in onset, vision loss often declined slowly over many months, frequently to finger counting, or worse without recovery. An afferent pupillary defect was always present at the time of presentation. Most affected optic discs were pale at the time of first visual symptoms, indicating that subclinical optic nerve damage had been present for several weeks. The latency from completion of radiation to onset of vision loss ranged from 7 to 48 months (average: 18 months). In 2 patients, radiation was delivered to the whole brain, rather than being limited to the anterior visual pathway. MRI typically displayed a discrete region of enhancement of the affected prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with expansion and high T2 signal in the enhancing segment. In 3 affected eyes, enhancement was apparent on imaging completed 3-6 weeks before the onset of vision loss. In one patient, segmental prechiasmatic enhancement became evident only on repeat MRI completed 7 months after vision loss. The duration of enhancement among 9 eyes with follow-up MRIs was at least 2 months, but in one case, enhancement was still present on a study performed 17 months after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This study further delineates the profile of RON. Visual loss is often acute, profound, and monocular but may decline slowly after acute onset and later affect both optic nerves. High-resolution MRI of the optic nerves usually will display enhancement of a discrete segment of the intracranial prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with accompanying expansion and T2 hyperintensity. In some cases, these imaging features may precede vision loss. They may be subtle or appear after vision loss. Enhancement lingers for a wide interval, ranging in this study from 2 to at least 17 months. Recognition of these imaging characteristics assists in confirmation of the diagnosis of RON."
501,Excluded,"Type 5 phosphodiesterase regulates glioblastoma multiforme aggressiveness and clinical outcome Expression of type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5), a cGMP-specific hydrolytic enzyme, is frequently altered in human cancer, but its specific role in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Herein, by analyzing a cohort of 69 patients affected by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who underwent chemo- and radiotherapy after surgical resection of the tumor, we found that PDE5 was strongly expressed in cancer cells in about 50% of the patients. Retrospective analysis indicated that high PDE5 expression in GBM cells significantly correlated with longer overall survival of patients. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous PDE5 by short hairpin lentiviral transduction (sh-PDE5) in the T98G GBM cell line induced activation of an invasive phenotype. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 activity strongly enhanced cell motility and invasiveness in T98G cells. This invasive phenotype was accompanied by increased secretion of metallo-proteinase 2 (MMP-2) and activation of protein kinase G (PKG). Moreover, PDE5 silencing markedly enhanced DNA damage repair and cell survival following irradiation. The enhanced radio-resistance of sh-PDE5 GBM cells was mediated by an increase of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of cellular proteins and could be counteracted by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Conversely, PDE5 overexpression in PDE5-negative U87G cells significantly reduced MMP-2 secretion, inhibited their invasive potential and interfered with DNA damage repair and cell survival following irradiation. These studies identify PDE5 as a favorable prognostic marker for GBM, which negatively affects cell invasiveness and survival to ionizing radiation. Moreover, our work highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting PKG and/or PARP activity in this currently incurable subset of brain cancers."
456,Excluded,"Pharmacological alterations that could underlie radiation-induced changes in associative memory and anxiety It is widely known that ionizing radiation is a physical agent broadly used to kill tumor cells during human cancer therapy. Unfortunately, adjacent normal tissues can concurrently undergo undesirable cell injury. Previous data of our laboratory demonstrated that exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations induced a variety of behavioral differences respect to controls, including changes in associative memory and in anxiety state. However, there is a lack of data concerning modifications in different related pharmacological intermediaries. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the behavioral differences observed in young animals irradiated at birth might be underlain by early changes in PKCs1 levels which, in turn, could lead to changes in hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Different pharmacological markers related to the affected behavioral tasks were assessed in control and irradiated hippocampus at 15 and 30 days, namely GABAA receptor, GAD65-67, ROS and PKCs1. Results showed that all measured parameters were increased in the hippocampus of 30-days-old irradiated animals. In contrast, in the hippocampus of 15-days-old irradiated animals only the levels of PKCs1 were decreased. These data suggest that PKCs1 might constitute a primary target for neonatal radiation damage on the hippocampus. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that an initial decrease in the levels of this protein can trigger a subsequent compensatory increase that, in turn, could be responsible for the plethora of biochemical changes that might underlie the previously observed behavioral alterations."

Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction technique. One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue."
2151,Excluded,"The ATM gene and protein: possible roles in genome surveillance, checkpoint controls and cellular defence against oxidative stress The autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is highly pleiotropic. It is characterized by gradual loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, leading to progressive neuromotor deterioration, immunodeficiency, developmental defects in specific tissues, profound predisposition to malignancy and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation. AT cells show chromosomal instability, premature senesence, radiosensitivity and defects in cell cycle checkpoints activated by ionizing radiation. Several radiation induced pathways that regulate the cell cycle seem to be defective in AT cells, at least one of which is mediated by TP53. Extensive characterization of the cellular defects of AT cells, together with the recent isolation of the ATM gene, has provided some insight into the possible physiological roles of the ATM protein. Several lines of evidence, including the nature of the agents that elicit the hypersensitivity of AT cells, point to the possibility of a defect in the response to damage induced by oxidative stress, which affects various cellular macromolecules. The ATM protein might have a role in activating defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. This hypothesis broadens the previous concept of the AT defect and explains several aspects of the AT phenotype that cannot be accounted for by defective processing of DNA damage. [References: 179]"

Malignancy-associated HLH is not only more common in the setting of T/NK-cell lymphomas, but may also rarely be seen in the setting of B-cell lymphoma. Here, we describe a unique case of a patient who initially was diagnosed with HLH secondary to Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection and subsequently developed EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma affecting the brain.

Cytoreduction and PDT have postulated to afford better local GBM-control. However, the interaction of PDT with newer novel therapies had not been fully investigated. This study reviewed the impact of PDT in conjunction with intraoperative radiotherapy.METHODS: Case note review of prospectively collected data of GBMs treated surgically by the senior author (SE). Patients received standard therapy (ST), ST+PDT or ST+PDT+IORT. ST involved maximum safe resection, PDT involved intracavity 100 J/cm2 630 nm laser and IORT involved intracavity 10-15 Gys using the PRS400 R. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically till death.RESULTS: There were 73 patients included in this analysis (42 males). The average age was 59years. Thirty received PDT and 43 did not. The mean survival of PDT-patients was significantly longer than those had ST alone (62.9 weeks vs. 20.6 weeks) (p=0.001). Patients < 65 year of age survived longer than those >= 65 year (p=0.033). IORT on its own did not make a significant difference to survival (p=0.111). However the average survival for patients who received PDT+IORT was substantially higher than those who received PDT alone (79 weeks vs. 39.7 weeks). Using a Cox regression covariant analysis, demonstrated that PDT was the only therapy to make a statistically significant difference to survival (p=0.018).CONCLUSIONS: PDT in high grade glioma was statistically significant therapeutic modality and its effects were further improved by IORT."

1170,Excluded,"Epidemiology of intracranial meningioma Intracranial meningiomas arise from the meninges and typically have benign histologic findings. They constitute approximately 20% of all intracranial tumors. Their incidence increases with age, and they affect women more commonly than men. The annual incidence per 100,000 people ranges from two to seven for women and from one to five for men. Since the first study was published in 1970, only eight major epidemiologic studies have been done that attempted to identify risk factors for meningioma. Ionizing radiation and head trauma have emerged as the most promising etiologic risk factors. In these studies, radiation doses as low as 1-2 Gy have been associated with increased risk. The role of dental radiographs has been suggested in some studies but not supported in others. An explanation for the apparent excess of meningiomas in women remains obscure. The potential effects of endogenous or exogenous sex hormones on tumor induction or growth remain unexplored in epidemiologic studies. More should be learned about the risk factors for meningioma in search of opportunities for prevention. [References: 87]"
2475,Excluded,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapies (PRRTs): Which are the dosimetric data for the patients? Introduction: NeuroEndocrine Tumours (NETs) belong to a relatively rare class of neoplasms. Nonetheless, their prevalence has increased significantly during the last decades. Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) therapeutic effect is based on the binding of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue peptides with NETs' somatostatin receptors, resulting in internal irradiation of tumours. Pre-therapeutic patient-specific dosimetry is essential for a treatment course with high levels of safety and efficacy. This study reviews the methods and dosimetric results of PRRT dosimetry presented in the literature. Focus is given on data concerning the therapeutic somatostatin analogue radiopeptides <sup>111</sup>In-[DTPA<sup>0</sup>,DPhe<sup>1</sup>]- octreotide (<sup>111</sup>In-DTPA-octreotide), <sup>90</sup>Y-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC) and <sup>177</sup>Lu-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>,Thr<sup>8</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE). Material(s) and Method(s): This study included papers that have performed dosimetry in adult patients for the therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals <sup>111</sup>In- DTPA-octreotide, <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC and <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. Furthermore, papers presented herein were published during the last 15 years (1999 - 2013), with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE studies being published during the last 4 years (2010 - 2013). Additionally, selection was limited to papers providing dosimetric data for at least two regions of interest. Result(s): Dosimetric results are provided for tumors, kidneys, red marrow, liver and spleen, Following Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee formalism, dosimetric analysis demonstrates large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake, with kidneys and bone marrow being the critical organs. Results are dependent on the image acquisition and processing protocol, as well as the dosimetric imaging radiopharmaceutical. Discussion(s): The large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake stresses the need for personalized therapy planning. Patient-specific dosimetry in PRRT is therefore needed, in order for the fixed dose regimens to be replaced with patient-tailored therapy planning. Kidney absorbed doses are higher in PRRT with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, allowing for higher <sup>177</sup>Lu activities to be administered in <sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE therapies. In order for such dosimetric techniques to be systematically implemented in a busy clinical environment, dosimetry software programmes may provide an essential tool, as they help in making the procedures less time-intensive."

This work compares geometric equivalence of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CTs and synCTs for brain cancer patients and quantifies performance for partial brain IGRT.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten brain cancer patients (12 lesions, 7 postsurgical) underwent MR-SIM and CT-SIM. SynCTs were generated by combining ultra-short echo time, T1, T2, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery datasets using voxel-based weighted summation. SynCT and CT DRRs were compared using patient-specific thresholding and assessed via overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index. Planar IGRT images for 22 fractions were evaluated to quantify differences between CT-generated DRRs and synCT-generated DRRs in 6 quadrants. Previously validated software was implemented to perform 2-dimensional (2D)-2D rigid registrations using normalized mutual information. Absolute (planar image/DRR registration) and relative (differences between synCT and CT DRR registrations) shifts were calculated for each axis and 3-dimensional vector difference. A total of 1490 rigid registrations were assessed.RESULTS: DRR agreements in anteroposterior and lateral views for overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index were >0.95. Normalized mutual information results were equivalent in 75% of quadrants. Rotational registration results were negligible (<0.07degree). Statistically significant differences between CT and synCT registrations were observed in 9/18 matched quadrants/axes (P < .05). The population average absolute shifts were 0.77 +/- 0.58 and 0.76 +/- 0.59 mm for CT and synCT, respectively, for all axes/quadrants. Three-dimensional vectors were <2 mm in 77.7 +/- 10.8% and 76.5 +/- 7.2% of CT and synCT registrations, respectively. SynCT DRRs were sensitive in postsurgical cases (vector displacements >2 mm in affected quadrants).CONCLUSIONS: DRR synCT geometry was robust. Although statistically significant differences were observed between CT and synCT registrations, results were not clinically significant. Future work will address synCT generation in postsurgical settings."

Methods and materials Twenty radiographers were randomized into two identically sized study groups. Training consisted of a theoretical and practical workshop using a phantom. Tests were performed to compare the effect of training to nontraining, and the effect of time duration on the maintenance of RSA skills. The effect of training was measured by a written test and three defined parameters influencing image quality. Results Group A reduced significantly (p < 0.001) by 31.3 mm (21-31%) the distance between the centrum of the prosthesis (CP) and the centrum of the calibration field (CCF) and increased the number of beads (NB) visible by 3.6 (out of 18). A further significant reduction of 5.1 mm (p = 0.023), 1.0 bead more (p < 0.001) and a 2.1 (p = 0.022) point better rotation of the prosthesis (RP) was registered two months later. Group B was tested twice without training and no significant improvement was registered. One month after training group B had experienced overall significant improvement on a par with group A. Conclusion It is realistic to implement an RSA X-ray training program where radiographers significantly improve their theoretical and practical skills in centering the CP closer to the CCF, NB and RP. A duration of up to two months after training does not influence the quality of participants' performance. Copyright Â© 2017 The College of Radiographers"

It is a slow-progressing chronic indolent disease characterized by atypical T-cells with a cerebral nucleus. Management of this disease depends on the stage and is based essentially on the systemic treatment. Radiotherapy intervenes in case of localized or extended tumor, indeed, the radiosensibility of this tumor, like any other hematological affection, makes it possible to obtain a high rate of response. Clinical case: we report the observation of a 46-year-old patient followed since 2012 for mycosis fungoid revealed by a papullo-squamous lesion located at the level of the right lumbar fossa. The diagnosis was confirmed by cutaneous biopsy, showing the presence of T lymphocytes expressing CD2, CD3, CD4, CCR4, CD45RO markers. Initial assessment included a thoraco-abdominal pelvic CT, which was normal, an accelerated sedimentation rate at the 1<sup>st</sup> hour, a high C reactive protein (CRP), the electrolytic, renal, hepatic status and the hemogram were normal. Patient received 6 courses of chemotherapy according to the COPP protocol with a decrease in the size of the lesion estimated at 40%. A norm fractionated radiation therapy was delivered at the dose of 36Gy. The evolution was marked by a complete remission, maintained after 6 months of the treatment.

The mechanisms that modulate microglial trogocytosis of axons and its function in neural circuit development remain poorly understood. Here, we directly observe axon trogocytosis by microglia in vivo in the developing Xenopus laevis retinotectal circuit. We show that microglia regulate pruning of retinal ganglion cell axons and are important for proper behavioral response to dark and bright looming stimuli. Using bioinformatics, we identify amphibian regulator of complement activation 3, a homolog of human CD46, as a neuronally expressed synapse-associated complement inhibitory molecule that inhibits trogocytosis and axonal pruning. Using a membrane-bound complement C3 fusion protein, we demonstrate that enhancing complement activity enhances axonal pruning. Our results support the model that microglia remodel axons via trogocytosis and that neurons can control this process through expression of complement inhibitory proteins.

2562,Excluded,"Mechanisms of caspase-1 mediated schwannoma regression Schwannoma tumors are composed of Schwann-lineage cells and form along peripheral, spinal and cranial nerves. These tumors can cause pain, sensory/motor dysfunction, and death through compression of peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and/or the brain stem. We have previously shown gene therapy for these tumors using a xenograft model in which immortalized human schwannoma cells (HEI-193) expressing a fluorescent protein and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Our strategy has been to express the apoptotic protein, caspase-1 (ICE, IL1-converting enzyme) under the P0 promoter, selectively active in Schwann cells during development, using an adeno-associated vector 1 (AAV1) injected directly into the tumors. Caspase-3 is the most common pro-apoptotic target for therapeutic modulation. However, unlike caspase-3, caspase-1 has a strong pro-inflammatory component in addition to induction of apoptosis. Caspase-1 activates pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18, which in turn trigger immune responses mediated by neutrophils and monocytes, or NK cells; it has been associated with both innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, caspase-1 is activated by several chemotherapeutic drugs and can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Our recent data indicate that AAV1- P0-ICE not only induces apoptosis of infected caspase-1-expressing HEI-193 schwannoma cells, but also kills non-infected tumor cells through a bystander effect mediated by both tumor- and host-specific mechanisms. Supernatants derived from HEI-193 cells transfected with AAV1-P0-ICE DNA kill non-transfected tumor cells in vitro. Similarly, peripheral nerve implantation of a 1:1 mixture of AAV-P0- ICE DNA-transfected and non-transfected HEI-193 cells prevented tumor growth. This bystander killing effect induced by AAV1-P0-ICE was also observed when established intra-sciatic HEI-193 tumors were injected with AAV1-P0-ICE transfected cells. Interestingly, intra-sciatic implantation of HEI-193 cells 2 weeks after injection at the same location of AAV1-P0-ICE DNA-transfected cells, i.e. long after all of the originally implanted caspase-1expressing HEI-193 cells should be dead, also prevents formation of a tumor. These data suggest that caspase-1-induced death of HEI-193 cells in vivo leads to local changes in the region of the tumor capable of preventing formation of a subsequent tumor. This investigation of AAV1-P0-ICE induced bystander killing of tumor cells has the potential to generate new therapeutics for the neurofibromatoses, as well as, for other benign neoplasms. Not only can caspase-1 induce apoptosis, but the resulting tumor killing and associated activation of host immune responses may generate a vaccination effect that could control the development and growth of subsequent schwannomas."

Time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) uses pulsed light attenuation at multiple wavelengths (600-950 nm) to discretely quantify oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and determine total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation (OS) and cerebral blood volume (BV) in the region between each light source and detector. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of employing a novel TD-NIRS technology to assess absolute levels of cerebral BV and OS with broad spatial coverage in order to detect regions of ischemia. Method(s): Ischemic stroke (IS) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients underwent TD-NIRS measurements. IS patients were fitted with a rectangular probe over the region of ischemia (2 rows of 4 sources between 3 rows of 5 detectors), using CT as a guide (external acoustic meatus as reference). SAH patients were fitted with a linear ""anterior crown"" probe with light sources and detectors arranged alternating in a single row (7 sources, 6 detectors). Clearance above the frontal sinus was guided by CT imaging (nasion as reference). 1.8 cm separated all source-detector pairs. Time-correlated single photon-counting photomultiplier tubes detected photons to measure absorption of pulsed light emitted at 3 wavelengths (690, 805, and 835 nm). Maximal OS (OSmax) and BV (BVmax) were calculated for the entire region measured by the probe to enable multiple comparisons. Result(s): In IS patients, ischemic regions (n=4) had an OSmax of 65.8 SD 13.1; contralateral normal tissue had an OSmax of 85.3 SD 27.1 (paired t-test; p 0.14). Ischemic regions had a BVmax of 76.25 SD 24.17 compared with 104.0 SD 42.5 in contralateral normal tissue (p 0.18). Regional inspection showed good visual correlation with infarcts (Figure). Of SAH patients with serial measures (n=2), one developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bilateral infarcts, coincident with decreased BVmax on the right (72, day 1; 48, day 12) and left (153, day 1; 56, day 12); OS did not change. Conclusion(s): We were able to calculate multiregional BV and OS for patients with cerebral ischemia. Despite small sample size, we demonstrated a trend between contralateral (ischemic stroke) and historical (subarachnoid hemorrhage) controls. Leakage of light and absorption by hair produced artifacts that will require improvement in future applications. This system requires validation and further ergonomic refinement but has potential to enable continuous multiregional parenchymal monitoring. (Figure presented)."
2499,Excluded,"Reducing the dosimetric impact of positional errors in field junctions for craniospinal irradiation using VMAT AIM: To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose profile in treatment field overlap regions.BACKGROUND: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position during the treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like dose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised first, with dose prescription explicitly enforcing a ramp-like dose profile. The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the dose contribution of the upper spinal fields.RESULTS: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a) widening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set-up."

The gathered data will help to evaluate whether hygiene standards that limit maximum admissible EMF values (e.g., ICNIRP standards) protect against adverse effects of exposure. The study covered workers employed in transformer and distribution stations, medium wave transmitting stations, radio-service and radio and TV multichannel broadcasting stations. In all the cases, exposure levels were considerably lower than those set as admissible according to the ICNIRP standards. Nevertheless changes in the circulatory system and a significant relationship between blood pressure and neurovegetative regulation disorders and exposure parameters were observed. The frequency of changes in the circulatory system was significantly dependent not only on the maximum EMF value, but also on its dose, which indicates that the hygiene standards for EMF cannot be limited only to short-term exposure maximum values, but they should be supplemented with dose-related standards."

Our previous study has found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the present study, we report an unknown mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of minocycline. We demonstrated that minocycline prevented primary neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis and promoted radiation-induced autophagy in vitro. Moreover, using an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22 cells, we found that the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated HT22 cells was not related to DNA damage repair since minocycline did not facilitate DNA DSB repair in irradiated HT22 cells. Further investigation showed that minocycline significantly enhanced X-irradiation-induced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, thus resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, although the antioxidant potential of minocycline might contribute to its apoptosis-inhibitory effect, it was not involved in its enhancive effect on radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy. Taken together, we have revealed a novel mechanism for the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated neurons, e.g. minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis via enhancing radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy."

Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD). The differences of the degree of focusing observed among patients suggest that the intersection A(SW) intersection A(TX) can be used as a preliminary criterion for screening and calculation of the acoustic fields should confirm the degree of focusing patient by patient. In conclusion, shear waves provide a useful method for trans-cranial focusing in regions close to the skull surface."

Paired t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate the impact of infrared irradiation and its pulse width on the amplitudes and latencies of P100, respectively. The results from our preliminary study revealed that, the pulsed near-infrared laser depressed the VEP amplitude and shortened the latency of P100; with the increment of pulse width of infrared irradiation, further decline of VEP amplitude and much shortened latency of P100 were observed.

Competing risk analysis demonstrated active extra-central nervous system (CNS) disease [Hazard ratio (HR) 0.236, P = 0.041] and total PTV on initial SRS (>= 5 mL) (HR 4.22, P = 0.033) to be associated with the NS rate. 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 41 and 11 %, respectively. The median OS time was 8.2 months. Active extra-CNS disease (HR 1.94, P = 0.034) and high KPS (>= 90) (HR 0.409, P = 0.006) were associated with the OS rate. In total, 798 tumors (75 %) in 66 patients (86 %) with sufficient radiological follow-up data were evaluated. 1- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 76.6 and 57.9 %, respectively. Prescribed dose (>= 20 Gy) (HR 0.326, P < 0.001), tumor volume (>= 2 mL) (HR 1.98, P = 0.007) and metastases from breast cancer (HR 0.435, P < 0.001) were independent predictive factors for local tumor control. Repeat salvage SRS for recurrent BM after WBRT appeared to be a safe and effective treatment. In the majority of patients, even those with numerous BM, neurological death could be delayed or even prevented."
1233,Excluded,"Solution X-ray scattering evidence for agonist- and antagonist-induced modulation of cleft closure in a glutamate receptor ligand-binding domain Agonist-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of glutamate receptor ion channels provide the driving force for molecular rearrangements that mediate channel opening and subsequent desensitization. The resulting regulated transmembrane ion fluxes form the basis for most excitatory neuronal signaling in the brain. Crystallographic analysis of the GluR2 LBD core has revealed a ligand-binding cleft located between two lobes. Channel antagonists stabilize an open cleft, whereas agonists stabilize a closed cleft. The crystal structure of the apo form is similar to the antagonist-bound, open state. To understand the conformational behavior of the LBD in the absence of crystal lattice constraints, and thus better to appreciate the thermodynamic constraints on ligand binding, we have undertaken a solution x-ray scattering study using two different constructs encoding either the core or an extended LBD. In agreement with the GluR2 crystal structures, the LBD is more compact in the presence of agonist than it is in the presence of antagonist. However, the time-averaged conformation of the ligand-free core in solution is intermediate between the open, antagonist-bound state and the closed, agonist-bound state, suggesting a conformational equilibrium. Addition of peptide moieties that connect the core domain to the other functional domains in each channel subunit appears to constrain the conformational equilibrium in favor of the open state."
630,Excluded,"Radiosurgery to palliate symptoms in brain metastases from uterine cervix cancer Background: The optimal management of brain metastases from uterine cervix cancer (UCC) is not well defined because of the rarity of the condition and the scarcity of published reports. Here we report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery for the management of brain metastases from UCC. Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with brain metastases from UCC were managed with a Leksell gamma-knife at our institution between January 2003 and December 2010. Clinical features and radiosurgical outcomes of patients were analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): Gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) was chosen as the only treatment in four patients and performed in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in nine patients. GKRS was conducted simultaneously with WBRT within a 1-month interval in six patients and was chosen as the salvage treatment after WBRT in three patients. The mean number of metastatic brain lesions per patient was 5.7 (range, 1-16). The median cumulative tumor volume was 23.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 2.7-40.2 cm<sup>3</sup>), and the median marginal dose covering the tumors was 14 Gy of a 50 % isodose line (range, 8-25 Gy). Nine patients showed relief of main neurologic symptoms after GKRS. The median length of time that the patients spent in an improved neurologic state was 11.1 weeks (range, 2-39.6 weeks). The local and distant control rates were 66.7 % and 77.8 %, respectively. The median survival from the date of GKRS until death was 4.6 months (range, 1.0-15.9 months). The 6-month and 12-month survival rates after GKRS were 38 and 15 %, respectively. Conclusion(s): GKRS could be an efficient palliative measure to relieve neurologic symptoms caused by brain metastasis from UCC. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien."
1914,Excluded,"Small Cell Lung Cancer: Therapies and Targets Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a fatal disease due to limited therapeutic options. Systemic chemotherapy is the bedrock of treatment for both the limited and extensive stages of the disease. However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC. It is hoped that the coming decade will witness the application of new molecular biology and genomic research techniques to improve our understanding of SCLC biology and identification of molecular subsets that can be targeted appropriately using established and emerging biological agents similar to the accomplishments of the last decade with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

2421,Excluded,"Duration of fluoroscopic-guided spine interventions and radiation exposure is increased in overweight patients BACKGROUND: The impact of patient body mass index (BMI) on image-guided spine interventions remains unknown. Higher BMI is known to complicate the acquisition of radiographic images. Therefore it can be hypothesized that the patient's body habitus can influence the delivery of a spinal injection.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of patient BMI on the length of fluoroscopy and procedure times during spine interventions.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 2 prospective observational studies.SETTING: All injections were performed in an outpatient university setting.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 209 patients in whom spine injections were performed (99 women), with a mean age of 54.6 years.METHODS: The fluoroscopy times for 202 participants and total procedure times for 137 participants were recorded. Additional participant characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, and actual procedures performed, also were collected. Analysis of covariance and linear and nonlinear model analysis were performed to assess the effect of BMI on fluoroscopy and procedure times.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fluoroscopy time and procedure duration times.RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 54.6 years, 51% were men, and 77% (n = 155) were overweight (BMI >=25). Participants received the following interventions: 40 zygapophyseal joint injections, 33 medial branch nerve blocks, 113 transforaminal epidural injections, and 16 combined zygapophyseal joint injections and epidural injections. Gender, procedure number, and procedure type did not differ between groups. The overweight group demonstrated a 30% increase in mean fluoroscopy time and a 35% increase in mean procedure time. Controlling for other variables, we found that differences in fluoroscopy time and procedure time were significant (P = .032 and P = .031, respectively) between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopy time in overweight patients increase the risks associated with spine interventions, not only to the patients but also to the operating room staff exposed to ionizing radiation."

In order to predict the hourly maximum ozone one day in advance based on the meteorological variables for the Wanqingsha site in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, a neural network model (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and a multiple linear regression model were used and compared. Model inputs are meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and solar radiation) of the next day and hourly maximum ozone concentration of the previous day. The OBS (optimal brain surgeon) was adopted to prune the neutral work, to reduce its complexity and to improve its generalization ability. We find that the pruned neural network has the capacity to predict the peak ozone, with an agreement index of 92.3%, the root mean square error of 0.0428 mg/m3, the R-square of 0.737 and the success index of threshold exceedance 77.0% (the threshold O3 mixing ratio of 0.20 mg/m3). When the neural classifier was added to the neural network model, the success index of threshold exceedance increased to 83.6%. Through comparison of the performance indices between the multiple linear regression model and the neural network model, we conclud that that neural network is a better choice to predict peak ozone from meteorological forecast, which may be applied to practical prediction of ozone concentration."

Wistar rats were divided into five experimental groups (n = 5-8/group): sedentary control (CON); exercise + passive recovery (PR); and exercise + LEDT (1.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1.8 J; 4.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 6.3 J; 10.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 15 J). After 100 min of swimming, the rats in the LEDT groups were exposed to phototherapy on the triceps surae muscle. For mechanical hyperalgesia evaluation, paw withdrawal threshold was assessed before and 24 h after swimming. Immediately after hyperalgesia tests, blood samples were collected to analyze creatine kinase (CK) activity and the soleus muscle was removed for histological and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha immunohistological analyses. In all LEDT groups, plasma CK activity was reduced to levels similar to those measured in the CON group. Paw withdrawal threshold decreased in the PR group (- 11.9 +/- 1.9 g) when compared to the CON group (2.2 +/- 1.5 g; p < 0.01) and it was attenuated in the group LEDT 4.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (- 3.3 +/- 2.4 g, p < 0.05). Less leukocyte infiltration and edema and fewer necrotic areas were found in histological sections of soleus muscle in LEDT (4.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) and LEDT (10.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) groups compared to the PR group.

[Chinese] Objective: To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of three-dimensional conformal therapy combined with icotinib or erlotinib in elderly and advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations and brain metastases. Method(s): Seventy-six elderly and advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations and brain metastases treated in our departments between November 2011 and November 2013 were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty-eight patients in treatment group received three-dimensional conformal radiation including primary tumors and metastases combined with icotinib (125 mg, tid, po), and the dose for pulmonary primary tumors and lung metastases was 36-60 Gy (2 Gy/d, 5 d/week), and for brain metastases the dose of whole brain radiotherapy was 30-40 Gy (2 Gy/d, 5 d/week), then increased dose of IMRT was 10-20 Gy (2 Gy/d, 5 d/week). Thirty-eight ones in the control group were treated with the same radiation regimen and erlotinib (150 mg, qd, po). The efficacy and toxicity were evaluated after two cycles. Result(s): The efficacy and toxicity could be evaluated in the 78 cases. The overall response rates were 63.2% and 57.9%, and the median progression free survival (PFS) was 9.9 and 9.0 months. Subgroup analysis showed that PFS in the two groups with different EGFR mutations was 11.2 and 10.6 months (19 exon deletion), 8.7 and 7.9 months (21 exon mutation), respectively, without significant difference (P>0.05). The most common toxicities of the two groups were rash, leukopenia, diarrhea and hepatic injury, which could be tolerated, with no significant difference (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Three-dimensional conformal therapy combined with icotinib or erlotinib in elderly and advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations and brain metastases has similar outcome and tolerance, thus being worthy of clinical application.

2247,Excluded,"Radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases based on a fast, three-dimensional MR imaging technique A fast, three-dimensional (3D) sequence for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and its application in radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases is reported. The measuring sequence (MPRAGE) requires magnetization-prepared 180degree inversion pulses followed by rapid low angle excitation pulses and gradient-echoes for image generation. The resulting T<inf>1</inf>-weighted MPRAGE images were compared with two-dimensional (2D) T<inf>1</inf>- weighted spin-echo (SE) images after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. Gd- DTPA in 10 patients with known brain metastases. Original or multiplanar reformatted images obtained from a 128 partition data set of the 3D MPRAGE sequence offered comparable diagnostic quality to that of 2D SE imaging. Gd- DTPA enhancement and lesion targeting was similar in most of the patients in SE as well as MPRAGE imaging. During imaging and therapy the patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the MR and the linear accelerator installations. The dose calculation of the radiosurgery planning was based on 3D MR imaging data assuming a homogenous attenuation value inside the head which was sufficient for an accurate dose calculation since tissue inhomogeneities do not significantly influence the shape of the relative dose distribution especially for radiosurgery of the brain. Under this circumstance the dose calculation can be based only on the 3D geometric conformation of the patient's head. A simple algorithm for treatment planning can be used if the MR data are free of geometric distortion. Target point definition, external head contour, and critical structures could be precisely defined in 3D MPRAGE images offering important advantages (i.e., improved spatial resolution, reformatted image reconstruction, rapid 3D imaging and short examination time under mask fixation resulting in better patient comfort, better slice profile, reduced vascular pulsation artefacts, superior and variable choice of soft tissue contrast due to centric phase-encoding order, lower specific absorption rate) over conventional 2D SE imaging. In addition, target volume, calculated dose distribution, and critical structures can be displayed as 3D shaded structures for better assessment for matching of target volume and dose distribution. These findings, along with other advantages of 3D imaging, indicate that the MPRAGE sequence may provide an alternative to T<inf>1</inf>-weighted 2D SE imaging in the radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases."

METHOD(S): Examination protocols for CT and CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, as well as CTP were simulated using a Somatom Sensation Cardiac 64. Effective doses were derived from measurements with the use of lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF-TLD) at several organ sites using an Alderson-Rando phantom. RESULT(S): LiF-TLD measurements resulted in effective doses of 1.7 mSv for CT, 1.9 mSv for CTA of intracranial vessels, and 2.8 mSv for CTA of cervical vessels, respectively. Depending on examination parameters, effective doses varied between 1.1 and 5.0 mSv for cerebral CTP. For CTP, local doses in the area of the primary beam ranged between 114 and 444 mGy. CONCLUSION(S): Comprehensive stroke imaging may result in up to 9.5 mSv with possible local doses of 490 mGy.

All patients with RUF initially underwent diverting colostomy (six cystoprostatectomy with closure of the fistula, omental interposition and urinary diversion; one prostatectomy, bladder neck closure, fistula closure with omentum flap and continent vesicostomy). Three patients had the fistula closed with gracilis muscle flap using the York-Mason approach (one had a bladder neck closure and suprapubic tube; one elected to have no treatment). All patients with BNC had received three or more procedures to resect or incise their contracture. Four had diversion with a catheterizable segment, two used an indwelling Foley catheter and one uses intermittent catheterization.RESULTS: All six patients who had cystoprostatectomy with urinary diversion have had no recurrence of their RUF. All three treated with the York-Mason procedure healed well. One developed recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma and two a secondary neoplasia in the prostate or rectum (leiomyosarcoma and neuroendocrine, respectively). The enterocystoplasty patient developed sepsis after colostomy reversal and subsequently died. In those patients with BNC, the four who underwent urinary diversion fared well; two tolerate the indwelling catheter poorly, and the seventh uses intermittent catheterization with occasional difficulty.CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy with or without external irradiation can be associated with severe complications. RUF managed with aggressive anterior pelvic exenteration and urinary diversion can be associated with excellent results. The York-Mason procedure in patients with an adequate urinary continence mechanism and bladder dynamics may provide good functional results. The presence of a secondary malignancy in patients deserves further investigation. Many recurrences of a BNC tend be refractory to transurethral resection/incision; indwelling catheters are then poorly tolerated and patients may require a major reconstructive procedure."

Saline (control) or DFMO (150 mg/kg/day) was infused for 18 days starting 2 days before irradiation. At varying times up to 8 weeks after irradiation, brain tissues were collected and the cell responses in and around the focal lesion were quantified. Immunohistochemical stains were used to label astrocytes (GFAP), vascular endothelial cells (Factor VIII), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; MAC 387) and cells synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (BrdU). Cellular responses were quantified using a histomorphometric analysis.RESULTS: After radiation alone, cellular events included a substantial acute inflammatory response followed by increased BrdU labeling and progressive increases in numbers of capillaries and astrocytes. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine treatment significantly affected the measured cell responses. As in controls, an early inflammatory response was measured, but after 2 weeks there were more PMNs/unit area than in controls. The onset of measurable BrdU labeling was delayed in DFMO-treated animals, and the magnitude of labeling was significantly reduced. Increases in astrocyte and vessel numbers/mm2 were observed after a 2-week delay. At the site of implant, astrocytes from DFMO-treated dogs were significantly smaller than those from controls.CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial cell proliferation and infiltration in response to interstitial irradiation of normal brain, and these responses are significantly altered by DFMO treatment. Although the precise mechanisms by which DFMO exerts its effects in this model are not known, the results from this study suggest that modification of radiation injury may be possible by manipulating the response of normal cells to injury."

The goal of our project was to evaluate the dosimetric and clinical impact of 3D vs. two-dimensional (2D) planning for patients who require simple palliative radiotherapy techniques (<= 2 beams) for bone metastases.METHODS: Patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for bone metastases were eligible. The study oncologists first documented the intended treatment target, defined the treatment target/field using digital radiographs (2D), followed by using full 3D planning computerized tomography volumetric datasets. Treatment plans were compared dosimetrically, and patient-reported outcomes (pain, fatigue, anorexia, and nausea) were compared against a historical cohort treated with 2D plans.RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled in the study group. Review of the 3D datasets led to changes in the target area of interest in 44/85 (52 %) of cases, of which 21/85 (25 %) were clinically significant. 3D plans resulted in superior target coverage and normal tissue sparing. There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes however.CONCLUSION: 3D radiotherapy planning resulted in superior treatment plans but we were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit in clinical outcomes. Prospective study designs are needed to describe the contemporary expectation of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases in the modern era of 3D planning."

Material(s) and Method(s): between January 2000 and December 2013, 82 patients underwent concomitant chemo-radiation with curative intent. By January 2007, IMRT was clinically available at our department and became preferentially adopted in place of 3DCRT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to progressive disease or death from any cause; overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to death from any cause. Acute and late toxicities were retrospectively evaluated according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) and LENT SOMA scale, respectively. Result(s): Fifty-one patients (62.2%) were treated with 3DCRT while 31 with IMRT (37.8%). The median age of patients was 52.4 years. The majority of patients (54; 65.8%) were diagnosed with loco-regional advanced disease: 35 (42.6%) were in stage IVA/IVB disease and 19 (23.1%) in stage III, respectively. Sixty-four patients (78%) were treated with a conventionally-fractionated, 7 weeks RT regimen delivered in a sequential approach: 50 Gy were delivered to sites deemed at low risk of microscopic infiltration, 60 Gy to macroscopic uninvolved sites but deemed at high risk of disease presence or relapse, 70 Gy to tumor and involved nodal clinical target volumes (CTV's). In 18 patients (22%) the IMRT technique allowed the simultaneous delivery of different doses per fraction, namely 1.8 Gy, 2 Gy and 2.2 Gy aimed at the same volumes described above within a shorter overall treatment time (30 fractions delivered in 6 weeks). The majority of patients (62; 75.6%) received cisplatin-based, concomitant chemotherapy: a 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> three-weekly schedule was administered to 34 of them (56%) while the rest (28; 44%) received a 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly schedule. Twenty patients (24.3%) of the whole cohort diagnosed with very advanced tumors infiltrating neurological structures were given induction chemotherapy (cisplatin-5 fluorouracil or cisplatin- 5 fluoruracil-docetaxel regimens) before concomitant chemoradiation. Twenty patients (24.3%), mostly affected by stage I and II N0 disease, or unfit to receive chemotherapy, were treated with radiotherapy alone. In terms of clinical outcome, the 30-month PFS was 69.6%; progressive disease was diagnosed in 25 patients (30.4%), among them 18 treated with 3DCRT and 7 with IMRT. The first site of failure was distant in 12 (48%) cases and loco-regional in 13 (52%). In terms of OS, at a median follow-up of 51 months, 47 patients (57.3%) were alive. Regarding acute toxicity, the most frequent adverse event was severe (G3-G4) mucositis which was diagnosed in 17 patients in the 3DCRT group (33.3%) and in 8 in the IMRT group (25.8%). The 12-month xerostomia of moderate-severe intensity (G2-G3) was also more frequently found in the 3DCRT cohort than in the IMRT one (31.3% and 10% of patients, respectively). Conclusion(s): our retrospective, single-center experience supports the positive impact of technology evolution of RT techniques from 3DCRT to IMRT in the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer in terms of reduced toxicity and, potentially, improved quality of life."
2644,Included,"A mouse model replicating hippocampal sparing cranial irradiation in humans: A tool for identifying new strategies to limit neurocognitive decline Cancer patients undergoing cranial irradiation are at risk of developing neurocognitive impairments. Recent evidence suggests that radiation-induced injury to the hippocampi could play an important role in this cognitive decline. As a tool for studying the mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline, we developed a mouse model replicating the results of the recent clinical RTOG 0933 study of hippocampal sparing whole-brain irradiation. We irradiated 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice to a single dose of 10 Gy using either whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) or hippocampal sparing irradiation (HSI). These animals, as well as sham-irradiated controls, were subjected to behavioral/cognitive assessments distinguishing between hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent functions. Irradiation was well tolerated by all animals and only limited cell death of proliferating cells was found within the generative zones. Animals exposed to WBRT showed significant deficits compared to sham-irradiated controls in the hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. In contrast, HSI mice did not perform significantly different from sham-irradiated mice (control group) and performed significantly better when compared to WBRT mice. This is consistent with the results from the RTOG 0933 clinical trial, and as such this animal model could prove a helpful tool for exploring new strategies for mitigating cognitive decline in cancer patients receiving cranial irradiation."

Pulses of infrared radiation (IR; 1,863 nm, 200 micros, 200-250 Hz for 2-5 s, delivered via an optical fiber) produced a rapid, transient temperature increase of 6-12degreeC (above a baseline of 24-30degreeC). These IR pulse trains evoked transient increases in both nuclear and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) of 0.20-1.4 microM, with a simultaneous reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in regions containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IR-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] continued in medium containing no added Ca<sup>2+</sup> (+/-Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers) and low [Na<sup>+</sup>], indicating that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase was mediated by release from intracellular stores. Consistent with this hypothesis, the IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] response was prolonged and eventually blocked by inhibition of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase with cyclopiazonic acid, and was also inhibited by a high concentration of ryanodine and by inhibitors of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate). The thermal sensitivity of the response suggested involvement of warmth-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase was inhibited by TRPV4 inhibitors (HC-067047 and GSK-2193874), and immunostaining of spiral ganglion cultures demonstrated the presence of TRPV4 and TRPM2 that colocalized with ER marker GRP78. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevations is conferred by TRP channels on ER membranes, which facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux into the cytosol and thereby contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release via IP<sub>3</sub> and ryanodine receptors. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Infrared radiation-induced photothermal effects release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum of primary spiral ganglion neurons. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is mediated by activation of transient receptor potential (TRPV4) channels and involves amplification by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release. The neurons immunostained for warmth-sensitive channels, TRPV4 and TRPM2, which colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum. Pulsed infrared radiation provides a novel experimental tool for releasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, studying Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory mechanisms, and influencing neuronal excitability."
3021,Excluded,"[Clinical analysis of radiation optic neuropathy] OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, risk factors, diagnostic methods, treatment regimens and outcomes of Chinese adult patients with radiation optic neuropathy (RON).METHODS: Retrospective case series. Clinical data with RON admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from June 1999 to October 2010 were investigated retrospectively.RESULTS: Thirty-five cases (61 eyes) with RON were analyzed. All cases manifested as sudden binocular or monocular painless vision decrease. In 18 cases (51.4%), symptoms occurred within 36 months after the completion of radiation. In 43 eyes (70.5%), the visual acuity was less than 0.05 and/or with a visual field less than 10 degrees. In 52 eyes which the fundus could be examined, 41 eyes (78.8%) showed a clear boundary of optic papilla, including 6 eyes (14.6%) with normal appearance of optic papilla, 30 eyes (73.2%) with lighter color, 5 eyes (12.2%) with pale optic papilla, and 11 eyes (21.2%) with edematous or hemorrhagic and/or exudative optic papilla. Only 14 eyes showed abnormal visual field examination, mainly manifested as nerve bundle defect scotoma. Seven eyes (50%) manifested as arcuate scotoma, 3 eyes (21.4%) manifested as central scotoma and/or paracentral scotoma, 2 eyes accompanied by blind spot enlargement, 1 eye showed paracentral scotoma and 1 eye with quadrantanopia. Twenty-three eyes received fluorescein angiography (FFA), the major manifestations were low fluorescence at the optic nerve and areas of capillary nonperfusion. Pattern visual evoked potential revealed reduced amplitude and/or extended incubation period in 83.3% eyes. Treatment regimens including systemic corticosteroids, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, hyperbaric oxygen in combination with corticosteroid and laser photocoagulation, the visual acuity of 10 eyes (16.4%) had merely been improved.CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of visual function in RON is poor resulting from devastating visual loss and/or visual field defect. The main damage of the fundus is retinal vascular occlusion and optic atrophy at different degrees. No adequately effective therapies are proved currently. The treatment aimed on the complication could only provide a short-term improvement of the vision."
959,Included,"Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for brain tumors but it can cause delayed progressive cognitive decline and memory deficits. Previous studies suggested that this neurocognitive dysfunction might be linked to the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, little is known regarding how to reduce the cognitive impairment caused by radiation therapy. To investigate whether environmental enrichment (EE) promotes neurogenesis and cognitive function after irradiation, irradiated gerbils were housed in EE for 2 months and evaluated by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function, and immunohistochemical analysis for neurogenesis. Our results demonstrated that even relatively low doses (5-10 Gy) of irradiation could acutely abolish precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus by more than 90%. This reduction in precursor proliferation was persistent and led to a significant decline in the granule cell population 9 months later. EE housing enhanced the number of newborn neurons and increased residual neurogenesis. EE also significantly increased the total number of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, irradiated animals after EE housing showed a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory during the water-maze test and in rotorod motor learning over a 5-day training paradigm. In conclusion, EE has a positive impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery in irradiated adult gerbils. Our data suggest that there is still a considerable amount of plasticity remaining in the hippocampal progenitor cells in adult animals after radiation injury, which can become a target of therapeutic intervention for radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction."
222,Excluded,"Partial mitochondrial inhibition causes striatal dopamine release suppression and medium spiny neuron depolarization via H2O2 elevation, not ATP depletion Mitochondrial dysfunction is a potential causal factor in Parkinson's disease. We show here that acute exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (30-100 nM; 30 min) causes concentration-dependent suppression of single-pulse evoked dopamine (DA) release monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes in guinea pig striatal slices, with no effect on DA content. Suppression of DA release was prevented by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, implicating ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels; however, tissue ATP was unaltered. Because KATP channels can be activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as by low ATP, we examined the involvement of rotenone-enhanced H2O2 generation. Confirming an essential role for H2O2, the inhibition of DA release by rotenone was prevented by catalase, a peroxide-scavenging enzyme. Striatal H2O2 generation during rotenone exposure was examined in individual medium spiny neurons using fluorescence imaging with dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An increase in intracellular H2O2 levels followed a similar time course to that of DA release suppression and was accompanied by cell membrane depolarization, decreased input resistance, and increased excitability. Extracellular catalase markedly attenuated the increase in DCF fluorescence and prevented rotenone-induced effects on membrane properties; membrane changes were also largely prevented by flufenamic acid, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Thus, partial mitochondrial inhibition can cause functional DA denervation via H2O2 and KATP channels, without DA or ATP depletion. Furthermore, amplified H2O2 levels and TRP channel activation in striatal spiny neurons indicate potential sources of damage in these cells. Overall, these novel factors could contribute to parkinsonian motor deficits and neuronal degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction."

Although its utility has been limited by the relatively low (31) P NMR sensitivity, increasing magnetic field strength (B0 ) could significantly improve the quality and reliability of the (31) P MR spectra for biomedical research. To quantitatively understand the field dependence of in vivo (31) P MRS for brain applications, (31) P NMR sensitivity of phosphocreatine (PCr) in rat brains was measured and compared at 9.4 T and 16.4 T. Additionally, the linewidths and T1 relaxation times of PCr and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resonances obtained from human and animal brains over a wide B0 range from 4 T, 7 T, and 9.4 T to 16.4 T were examined and their field dependences were quantified. The results indicate an approximate 1.74-fold (31) P signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain for PCr at 16.4 T compared with 9.4 T. An approximate power 1.4 dependence of (31) P SNR on B0 was concluded. Substantial improvements in spectral resolution and significantly shortened T1 values of brain PCr and ATP were observed at high/ultrahigh fields, contributing to an additional sensitivity gain and spectral improvement. In summary, the overall findings from this study suggest that in vivo (31) P MRS should greatly benefit from high/ultrahigh fields for noninvasive assessment of altered bioenergetics and metabolic processes associated with brain function and neurological diseases."

Similar modulation can be detected at the protein level in melanoma cells except for no changes in PDE6 protein levels. Two regulatory pathways have been identified: Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 proteins for rhodopsin and PDE6, and mitogen-activated protein kinases for recoverin and arrestin. The visual cascade and retinoic acid as its derivate do not play any role in this process. Putative explanations for light-dependent modulation of cancer-retina antigen expression in melanoma cells are discussed."

The exact significance and pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity is still unknown, as studies on this subject lack sufficient patient numbers and are performed in an extremely varied manner.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-nine survivors (> 2 years from diagnosis) were examined neurologically and neuropsychologically, and underwent a cranial computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR). Eight patients were excluded from further analysis for various reasons (not SCLC-related CNS disease, n = 6; no chemotherapy nor PCI treatment, n = 2). The remaining 51 patients were divided into three groups; group 1 = chemotherapy alone (n = 21), group 2 = sequential PCI (n = 19), and group 3 = concurrent or sandwiched PCI (n = 11). Groups were neuropsychologically compared in matched controls.RESULTS: Performance status did not differ significantly between various treatment groups; all patients remained ambulatory and capable of self-care. Mental impairment (n = 20), motor abnormalities (n = 9), and visual complaints (n = 1), were found in five patients in group 1 (24%), eight patients in group 2 (42%), and eight patients in group 3 (73%). Analysis of brain atrophy revealed no significant results; however, white matter abnormalities were found more frequently in group 3. Neuropsychologically no significant group differences existed, although interference sensitivity and difficulties with divided attention tended to occur more frequently in patients treated with PCI. Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition."

Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice. In addition, radiation induced augmentation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and a decline in the total antioxidant capacity in serum; these changes were also ameliorated by melatonin pretreatment. The present results provide evidence supporting the antioxidant and neuroprotective function of melatonin."

Real time PCR analysis was utilized on days 5 and 20 to evaluate the expression of key genes involved in nerve regeneration consist of NGF, BDNF and GDNF. Evaluation of cellular proliferation following one day after laser treatment revealed significant decrease in cell proliferation compared to control group. However on day 7, significant increase in proliferation was found in both the irradiated groups in comparison with the control group. No significant difference was found between the laser treated groups. Treatment of SCs with laser resulted in significant increase in NGF gene expression on day 20. Difference between two treated groups and control group was not significant for BDNF and GDNF gene expression.

[Japanese] Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancers and brain tumors was started in December 2000 at our hospital. Methods of quality assurance (QA) in IMRT at our hospital are reported. IMRT was given by 4 MV X-ray with a dynamic multi-leaf collimator (MLC) method. Treatment planning was obtained by an inverse planning method. It took two days to select an appropriate treatment plan among various plans obtained by inverse planning, and three days to perform dosimetry in phantoms for each beam and the total beams and to determine an isocenter of fields. The measured dose distribution in phantoms were consistent with the calculated dose distribution, although the measured doses were 2-4% lower than the calculated doses. The accuracy of MLC is the most important point in QA of IMRT. Beam profiles were obtained for all beams by a semiconductor profiler before IMRT every day. In addition, position of MLC was checked by a test pattern of a film method once a week. This method is very accurate and the slight deviation of MLC position as small as 0.2 mm could be detected by the method.

2106,Excluded,"Associations among magnetic resonance spectroscopy, apparent diffusion coefficients, and image-guided histopathology with special attention to radiation necrosis OBJECTIVE: In patients with malignant glioma previously treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, clinical and radiographic signs of recurrent disease often require differentiation between radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor. Published work suggests that although magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can reliably differentiate pure tumor, pure necrosis, and spectroscopically normal tissues, it may not be particularly helpful because most patients have mixed histological findings comprised of necrosis and tumor. To improve our clinical ability to discriminate among these histological entities, we have analyzed MRS in conjunction with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences derived from magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS: In 18 patients, spectroscopic and diffusion-weighted images were obtained before surgery for suspected recurrent neoplastic disease. Spectral data for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were derived from 65 spectroscopic observations in patients with previously treated gliomas (n = 16) and metastatic tumors (n = 2). Spectral data for choline (Cho), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and lipid-lactate were analyzed separately and in conjunction with ADCs in all patients (15 observations of pure tumor, 33 observations of pure necrosis, and 13 observations of mixed tumor and necrosis). Histological specimens were obtained stereotactically at the time of surgery (<48 h after image acquisition) for recurrent disease and digitally co-registered with MRS data.RESULTS: ADC values for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were 1.30, 1.60, and 1.42, respectively. Cho/NAA less than 0.20, NAA/normal Cr greater than 1.56, and NAA/Cho greater than 1.32 increase the odds that a tissue biopsy will be pure necrosis versus mixed tumor and necrosis. Although various values of all MRS ratios analyzed may provide positive correlations for histopathological differentiation of tissue between that of pure tumor and that of pure necrosis, the addition of ADC values to only NAA/Cho and NAA/normal Cr increases the odds of correct differentiation between pure tumor and pure necrosis. The addition of ADC values does not provide additional information beyond that of MRS in distinguishing specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis from either pure tumor or pure necrosis.CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that MRS ratio analysis may allow for the clinical discrimination between specimens of pure tumor and pure necrosis, and the addition of ADC data into this analysis may enhance this specific differentiation. However, although a trend toward correlation between ADC values and the various histopathological features was noted, the direct addition of ADC data does not seem to allow further discrimination, beyond that provided by MRS, among specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis and either pure tumor or pure necrosis."

The current study sought to describe healthcare providers' (HCPs) decisions to treat with ceritinib and to describe patientreported side effects, perceived effectiveness and attitudes toward ceritinib. Method(s): One-on-one telephone interviews were conducted with HCPs caring for patients treated with ceritinib using a semi-structured interview guide designed to explore treatment decision-making, adverse events (AEs) and their management. Patients with current or past experience of ceritinib completed semi-structured telephone interviews designed to capture their experience. A thematic analysis of interview transcripts was conducted using qualitative analysis software, MaxQDA. Result(s): Study participants comprised 10 HCPs (6 oncologists, 4 nurses) and 18 patients (9 female) aged 34-78 years (mean=51.0; SD=11.3). HCPs reported relying on two main factors when deciding to switch patients to ceritinib or to next-line treatment after ceritinib: evidence of sufficient clear-cut progression and poor tolerance to treatment. Four HCPs reported considering clinical trials or other newly approved drugs instead of ceritinib. Patients and HCPs concurred that the most frequently reported side effects of ceritinib include diarrhea (n=15 patients; n=9 HCPs), nausea (n=13; n=10), vomiting (n=12; n=6), and abdominal pain (n=10; n=7). Dose reduction, antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and home remedies (e.g. ginger ale, crackers) were reported as being effective at managing these side effects prophylactically or once they occurred. Taking ceritinib with food was reported by 5 patients and 4 HCPs, and helped to improve nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Patients reported that ceritinib was effective in achieving or maintaining symptom control for cough (n=12 of 12 patients symptomatic at diagnosis) and shortness of breath (n=9 of 11 patients symptomatic at diagnosis). Of 14 patients with lung tumors at start of ceritinib, 13 reported positive tumor response during treatment. Three of 7 patients with brain metastases achieved reduction or no evidence of disease with ceritinib in combination with other interventions (e.g., radiation). Patients were asked what they liked about ceritinib: tumor response and symptom control, an extension of life, or improvement in quality of life were key themes. Patient-reported dislikes included side effects and number of pills. Of 14 patients asked specifically, all stated the benefits of ceritinib outweigh its side effects.

However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE. The severity of the disease may be a consequence of the effect of irradiation on the CNS vascular bed and impaired blood-brain barrier."

The immunochemical procedure might be used for early biological detection of the irradiation impairments as well as for estimation of radio-sensitivity of nuclear cells to the effects of irradiation and radioprotectors.
369,Excluded,"Patient and staff doses in interventional neuroradiology Radiation doses for interventional examinations are generally high and therefore necessitate dose monitoring for patients and staff. Relating the staff dose to a patient dose index, such as dose-area product (DAP), could be quite useful for dose comparisons. In this study, DAP and skin doses of 57 patients, who underwent neurointerventional examinations, were measured simultaneously with staff doses. Although skin doses were comparable with the literature data, higher DAP values of 215 and 188.6 Gy cm<sup>2</sup> were measured for the therapeutical cerebral and carotid examinations, respectively, owing to the use of biplane system and complexity of the procedure. Mean staff doses for eye, finger and thyroid were measured as 80.6, 77.6 and 28.8 muGy per procedure. The mean effective dose per procedure for the radiologists was 32 muSv. In order to allow better comparisons to be made, DAP normalised doses were also presented. Â© 2006 Oxford University Press."

However, the difference in local tumor progression between patients with 2-4 and those with 5-10 BMs has not been sufficiently examined for this data set. Thus, the authors reappraised this issue, employing the updated JLGK0901 data set with detailed observation via enhanced MRI. They applied sophisticated statistical methods to analyze the data. METHODS This was a prospective observational study of 1194 patients harboring 1-10 BMs treated with GKRS alone. Patients were categorized into groups A (single BM, 455 cases), B (2-4 BMs, 531 cases), and C (5-10 BMs, 208 cases). Local tumor progression was defined as a 20% increase in the maximum diameter of the enhanced lesion as compared to its smallest documented maximum diameter on enhanced MRI. The authors compared cumulative incidence differences determined by competing risk analysis and also conducted propensity score matching. RESULTS Local tumor progression was observed in 212 patients (17.8% overall, groups A/B/C: 93/89/30 patients). Cumulative incidences of local tumor progression in groups A, B, and C were 15.2%, 10.6%, and 8.7% at 1 year after GKRS; 20.1%, 16.9%, and 13.5% at 3 years; and 21.4%, 17.4%, and not available at 5 years, respectively. There were no significant differences in local tumor progression between groups B and C. Local tumor progression was classified as tumor recurrence in 139 patients (groups A/B/C: 68/53/18 patients), radiation necrosis in 67 (24/31/12), and mixed/ undetermined lesions in 6 (1/5/0). There were no significant differences in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis between groups B and C. Multivariate analysis using the Fine-Gray proportional hazards model revealed age < 65 years, neurological symptoms, tumor volume >= 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, and prescription dose < 22 Gy to be significant poor prognostic factors for local tumor progression. In the subset of 558 case-matched patients (186 in each group), there were no significant differences between groups B and C in local tumor progression, nor in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS Local tumor progression incidences did not differ between groups B and C. This study proved that tumor progression after GKRS without whole-brain radiation therapy for patients with 5-10 BMs was satisfactorily treated with the doses prescribed according to the JLGK0901 study protocol and that results were not inferior to those in patients with a single or 2-4 BMs. Copyright Â© AANS 2020, except where prohibited by US copyright law."
1449,Excluded,"Association Between Radiation Necrosis and Tumor Biology After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis BACKGROUND: The primary dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is radiation necrosis (RN), which occurs after approximately 5% to 10% of treatments. This adverse event may worsen neurologic deficits, increase the frequency and cost of imaging, and necessitate prolonged treatment with steroids or antiangiogenic agents. Previous investigations have primarily identified lesion size and dosimetric constraints as risk factors for RN in small populations. We hypothesized that disease histology, receptor status, and mutational status are associated with RN.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients presenting with brain metastasis between 1997 and 2015 who underwent SRS and subsequent radiographic follow-up at a single tertiary-care institution were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of radiographic RN. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to identify biological risk factors for RN.RESULTS: 1939 patients (5747 lesions) were eligible for inclusion; 285 patients (15%) experienced radiographic RN after the treatment of 427 (7%) lesions. After SRS, the median time to RN was 7.6 months. After multivariate analysis, graded prognostic assessment, renal pathology, lesion diameter, and the heterogeneity index remained independently predictive of RN in the pooled cohort. In subset analyses of individual pathologies, HER2-amplified status (hazard ratio [HR] 2.05, P=.02), BRAF V600+ mutational status (HR 0.33, P=.04), lung adenocarcinoma histology (HR 1.89, P=.04), and ALK rearrangement (HR 6.36, P<.01) were also associated with RN.CONCLUSIONS: In the present investigation constituting the largest series of RN, several novel risk factors were identified, including renal histology, lung adenocarcinoma histology, HER2 amplification, and ALK/BRAF mutational status. These risk factors may be used to guide clinical trial design incorporating biological risk stratification or dose escalation. Future studies determining the optimal timing of targeted therapies are warranted to further define the risk of RN."

The biological effectiveness of HZE particles has yet to be established, particularly with regard to nervous tissue. Using heavy ions accelerated at the AGS of Brookhaven National Laboratory, we study the neurotoxic effects of iron particles. We exposed retinal explants, taken from chick embryos, to determine the dose response relationships for neurite outgrowth. Morphometric techniques were used to evaluate the in vitro effects of 1 GeV/a iron particles (LET 148 keV/micrometer). Iron particles produced a dose-dependent reduction of neurite outgrowth with a maximal effect achieved with a dose of 100 cGy. Doses as low as 10-50 cGy were able to induce reductions of the neurite outgrowth as compared to the control group. Neurite generation is a more sensitive parameter than neurite elongation, suggesting different mechanism of radiation damage in our model. These results showed that low doses/fluences of iron particles could impair the retinal ganglion cells' capacity to generate neurites indicating the highly neurotoxic capability of this heavy charged particle."

1839,Excluded,"Comparison of Whole Heart Computed Tomography Scanners for Image Quality Lower Radiation Dosing in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: The CONVERGE Registry RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Novel technology in coronary computed tomographic angiography allows assessment of coronary artery disease with high image quality (IQ). There are currently two wide detector ""whole heart"" coverage scanners available, which avoid misregistration artifacts. However, there are no data directly comparing IQ between the two scanners. The aim of the current study is to investigate if IQ is different between the most scanners of GE and Toshiba broad detector scanners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter international cohort study comparing 236 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography using whole-heart scanners; 126 patients on scanner S1 ( Aquilion ONE Vision, Toshiba), and 110 patients on scanner S2 (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). Hounsfield units were measured using regions of interest in the descending aorta at 6 points (cranial slice, level of the visualized first, second, third, and fourth spines, and the caudal slice). We also compared the coverage length (z-axis) of the full width field of view between a single rotation of the two scanners.RESULTS: Evaluating mean CT attenuation values Hounsfield units through the scan range, are progressively reduced across the descending aorta in the S1 group, resulting in the larger difference of contrast brightness between the cranial and caudal slices compared to the S2 group (absolute difference: S2 13.0 +/- 4.4 vs S1 141.9 +/- 16.4, p < 0.0001; Percent difference: 19.3 +/- 2.1 vs -3.4 +/- 1.2, <0.0001). The standard deviation (SD) is similar at the cranial slice between the two scanners, however, the S1 group demonstrated higher SD-differential from cranial to caudal than S2 group. Median radiation exposure was significantly lower for the S2 scanner 1.50 +/- 0.75 mSv vs the S1 system 1.9 mSv (IQR 1.7-2.7 mSv) (p=0.01). Z-axis coverage was larger for the S2 scanner 152.5 mm (244 slices x 0.625 mm/slice) than 133 mm for S1 (266 slices x 0.5 mm/slice).CONCLUSION: Although both ""volume"" scanners cover the whole heart z-axis with one beat, scans using the S1 scanner have a larger variability in attenuation values throughout the scan range, resulting in 20% increase in nonuniformity from cranial to caudal slice. Additionally, SD variation across the field of view, a metric of noise, is larger when using the S1 scanner vs the S2 scanner. These results indicate that the GE Revolution CT has more uniform contrast enhancement and more coverage, lower radiation and lower image noise compared to the Toshiba Aquilion ONE Vision system."

It has been suggested to have antioxidant, antiviral, vasodilatation, cardioprotective, radiation protective effect, neuroprotective effect and to be able to cross blood-brain-barrier. Thus, it is a potential treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Furthermore, oxidative stress has been highly implicated in the progression of ND, hence, this leads to the study on Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway for the targeted effective therapies of ND in the future. Objective(s): To determine the effects of orientin on nitric oxide levels, intracellular calcium levels and the mechanism by which orientin protects SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage. Method(s): Orientin at pre-determined maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD), 20 muM and half MNTD (O MNTD), 10muM were subjected to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h, followed by 150 muM of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> oxidative induction for 24 h at 37degreeC. The Griess assay and Fluo-4 NW calcium assay were then performed to measure the NO levels and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by a microplate reader respectively.

The radiotracer (99mTc-MIBI) was injected in a peripheral vein 5 hours before the operation. A tumor to-normal tissue count ratio equal to or greater than 2/1 was considered indicative of tumor. MIBI SPECT was performed in five normal individuals in a pilot study.RESULTS: The gamma probe greatly facilitated intraoperative tumor detection (tumor to-normal brain count ratio was 5/1) and indicated a small piece of residual tumor after what was thought to be a complete tumor removal, allowing its resection, which, otherwise, would have been left behind. Postoperative CT confirmed complete tumor resection. The MIBI SPECT in normal individuals showed an increased uptake by the hypophisis, choroid plexus, skull, scalp and salivary glands and absence of uptake by the normal brain tissue. There were no complications.CONCLUSION: GPAS proved to be, in this single case, a safe and reliable technique to improve brain tumor detection and to confirm the presence or absence of residual tumor."

The number of Abeta plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1beta, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Abeta burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task.RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Abeta plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy x 10), 72% (2 Gy x 5) and 78% (2 Gy x 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001).

93,Excluded,"Urinary, anorectal and sexual assessment after pelvic cancer surgery Urinary, anorectal and sexual complications are often observed after pelvic cancer surgery. These symptoms may be secondary to a tumor compression or a specific surgical trauma of autonomic and somatic pathways involved in the bladder, bowel and sexual control. Indeed, pelvic organs are very close and share the same innervation, which plays an important role in the detrusor contraction, erectile function, pelvic floor contraction and global pelvi-perineal sensory functions. Moreover, pelvic irradiation and/or chemotherapy following specific surgery can also lead to neurogenic (myelopathy and plexopathy) lesions of centers and/or motor/sensory pathways, which control bladder and rectal functions. Specific bladder and rectal lesions secondary to irradiation are very common (chronic radiation cystitis, radiation rectitis). Sexual dysfunction from radiation therapy includes erectile dysfunction and vaginal stenosis. Urinary symptoms observed after pelvic surgery are principally characterized by voiding dysfunction with urinary retention or post void residual in case of neurogenic lesion. In some cases, overactive bladder symptoms (urge, frequency) are due to a radiation lesion of the bladder mucosa. Cystoscopy and urodynamic investigations are necessary to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms of these symptoms. Treatment of urinary retention is usually self-intermittent catherization and anticholinergic drugs can be used in case of overactive bladder. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can be used in male erectile dysfunction and vaginal dilators in case of vaginal stenosis. Perineal pain can be observed. Neurological mechanism is the main mechanism and can be confirmed by means of electrophysiological testing. This neuropathic pain can be managed by various treatments (drugs, TENS. . .)."

Each peptide gave a specific response to irradiation. The plasma levels of GRP and substance P were not modified by irradiation exposure; neither were those of motilin and PYY. Concerning gastrin, a 2-3-fold increase of plasma concentration was observed in pig, which presented the most important histological alterations of the stomach. The plasma levels of somatostatin, unchanged from 1 to 4 days after irradiation, was also increased by 130% at 5 days. In contrast, a diminution of neurotensin plasma levels was noted, firstly at 1 day (-88%), and from 3 days after exposure (-50%).

Adaptation to these daily and seasonal changes in light properties (and associated changes in the environment) is important to the sustained survival of higher life forms on our planet. Many organisms use their intrinsic circadian oscillator or clock to orchestrate daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology to adapt to diurnal changes. Some higher organisms use the same oscillator to monitor day length in selecting the appropriate season for reproductive behaviour. Organisms have developed irradiance measurement mechanisms to ignore photic noise (lightning, moonlight), and use the light of dusk and dawn for circadian photoentrainment. They have also devised multiple photoreceptors and signalling cascades to buffer against changes in the spectral composition of natural light. The interaction of the clock with ambient light is, therefore, quite intricate. [References: 31]"

When selecting surgical candidates, it is important to exclude terminal cases who will receive neither a survival benefit nor an improvement in their quality of life. We reviewed a total of 264 surgical cases of brain metastases and analyzed the clinical characteristics of early death in order to clarify the indication for and the role of surgery. The median survival time (MST) after surgery in all cases was 12.4 months. Early death was defined as death within 6 months, and 23% (62 cases) of this series were succumbed to this. A decrease in postoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (<70) (P = 0.041), lack of systemic therapy after surgery (P < 0.0001), and uncontrolled extracranial malignancies (P = 0.0022) were significantly related to early death in multivariate analysis, while preoperative KPS (<70) and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class were related to early death only in univariate analysis (P < 0.05). When analyzing patients with uncontrolled extracranial malignancies and those with a postoperative KPS score of 70 or greater (who were generally candidates for systemic therapy), the MST was significantly longer in the systemic therapy (+) group compared with the systemic therapy (-) group (12.5 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.0026).

The visual disturbances may be due to a combination of intracerebral pressure changes and exposure to ionizing radiation. The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy).

Materials/Methods: The PIE is simply defined as the product of the prescription dose in Gy (joule/kg, equivalent to mJ/mL of tissue) and the prescription isodose volume in mL. The senior radiation oncologist of the study (PKS) had previously reviewed and scored outcome (no failure/ no ARE, failure, asymptomatic vs symptomatic ARE, and indeterminate cases of lesion enlargement) after SRS at our institution from 1998-2009 for 2,200 brain metastases with at least 3 months of imaging follow-up. For this analysis, we considered the 1,640 metastases treated with SRS alone, or SRS after previous whole-brain radiation therapy, for which there was no coalescence of 50% of prescription dose-volume with that of any nearby metastasis. A logistic regression model was then developed to correlate the incidence of symptomatic ARE with a series of parameters that included PIE and peripheral isodose volumes such as 8-Gy to 12-Gy isodose volume, scoring symptomatic ARE as 2, indeterminate cases as 1, and remaining outcomes as 0 (no failure and no ARE, failure, or asymptomatic ARE). Result(s): There were 50 cases of symptomatic ARE in this subset. Marginal levels of significance were achieved when correlating the incidence of symptomatic ARE with peripheral isodose volumes. For example, using 12-Gy isodose volume, the logistically regressed slope was 0.828 +/- 0.429 (P =.082) with a 95% confidence interval of -0.127-1.782, in which the zero slope value cannot be directly rejected from the model. In contrast, PIE (in the units of mJ or Gy-mL) was found to be highly significant in correlating with the incidence of symptomatic ARE, yielding a positive slope value of 1.264 +/- 0.275 (P =.0003) with a 95% confidence interval of 0.681-1.848. The adjusted R2 and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were also significantly improved for PIE versus 12-Gy isodose volume (R2 = 0.88 vs 0.77 and jBICj = 33 vs 21, respectively). Based on the PIE results, functional curves were derived that enable a user to evaluate risk of symptomatic ARE when prescribing a dose to various target volumes. Conclusion(s): Analysis of >1,500 brain metastases treated with SRS has demonstrated that PIE is strongly predicative of developing symptomatic ARE, correlating more strongly with risk of ARE than 10 or 12-Gy volume."

Reduction of cortical temperature to 31 degrees C increased the threshold irradiation time to 82 sec on the average. Ten- to thirty-sec heating of cerebral cortex with a thermode elicited CSD when surface temperature exceeded 47 degrees C. Histological examination of the cortical areas exposed to threshold irradiation revealed a central coagulation lesion surrounded by edema.

The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number.

Patients received 30 Gy XRT given in 10 fractions to the whole brain. In phase I, patients were treated in groups of three at each topotecan dose level; dose escalation proceeded until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. The dose-limiting toxicity proved to be grade IV neutropenia at 0.6 mg/m2/d, resulting in an MTD of 0.5 mg/m2/d. One of nine patients showed a response to treatment, and that was partial (OR 11%). Three had stable disease (33%), and four experienced progressive disease (44%). Median progression-free survival was 60 d; median overall survival was 102 d. Intravenous topotecan at 0.5 mg/m2/d concomitant to XRT with 30 Gy in 3-Gy fractions is tolerable in patients with brain metastases. This regimen has the additional advantage of providing systemic treatment to patients with metastases in other locations while whole brain radiation is in progress. Although response and survival outcomes in this small study do not appear higher than expected from historical controls, these were not primary end points, and larger studies on this topic would be useful to elucidate the efficacy of this combination treatment regimen.

1575,Excluded,"Low amounts of the DNA repair XPA protein are sufficient to recover UV-resistance DNA integrity is threatened by the damaging effects of physical and chemical agents that can affect its function. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the most known and flexible mechanisms of DNA repair. This mechanism can recognize and remove damages causing DNA double-helix distortion, including the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts, promoted by ultraviolet light (UV). The human syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is clinically characterized chiefly by the early onset of severe photosensitivity of the exposed regions of the skin, a very high incidence of skin cancers and frequent neurological abnormalities. The xpa gene seems to be involved during UV damage recognition, in both global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR). The modulation of xpa expression may modify the DNA repair rate in the cell genome, providing a valuable contribution to an understanding of the NER process. The controlled expression of the cDNA xpa in XP12RO deficient cells was achieved through the transfection of a muristerone-A inducible vector, pINXA. The INXA15 clone shows good induction of the XPA protein and total complementation of XP12RO cell deficiency. Overexpression of this protein resulted in UV cell survival comparable to normal control human cells. Moreover, low expression of the XPA protein in these cells is sufficient for total complementation in cellular UV sensitivity and DNA repair activity. These data demonstrate that XPA protein concentration is not a limiting factor for DNA repair."
2307,Excluded,"Dental therapy before and after radiotherapy--an evaluation on patients with head and neck malignancies The present investigation evaluates the dental care situation of patients with head and neck cancer before and after radiotherapy. The situations of these patients in 1993 and 2005 were compared to detect similarities, differences and developments. In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005. Therefore the applied radiotherapeutic regimen differed not only between the two groups of patients, but also within each group. The information for these investigations was provided anonymously. It was evaluated with descriptive statistics. The evaluation of the data shows distinct differences with respect to preventive and therapeutic dental care measures. In 2005, 35 out of 36 patients (97.2%) had a dental consultation before radiotherapy (1993, 65%). All 27 dentate patients (100%) obtained a splint for fluoride application (1993, none). 29% fewer edentulous patients were seen than in 1993. The number of teeth destroyed decreased from 19.2% (1993) to 7.8% in 2005. Mycoses due to Candida spp. and chronic failures in wound healing were rare (5.5%). In the course of the 12 years, prophylactic measures, such as the application of splints for fluoride treatment, were intensified. However, concepts for the dental care of patients undergoing radiotherapy, especially following the radiation, should be widened to avoid ruined teeth and long delayed wound healings."
432,Excluded,"Range modulation in proton therapy planning: a simple method for mitigating effects of increased relative biological effectiveness at the end-of-range of clinical proton beams BACKGROUND: The increase in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of proton beams at the distal edge of the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) is a well-known phenomenon that is difficult to quantify accurately in vivo. For purposes of treatment planning, disallowing the distal SOBP to fall within vulnerable tissues hampers sparing to the extent possible with proton beam therapy (PBT). We propose the distal RBE uncertainty may be straightforwardly mitigated with a technique we call ""range modulation"". With range modulation, the distal falloff is smeared, reducing both the dose and average RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP.METHODS: One patient plan was selected to serve as an example for direct comparison of image-guided radiotherapy plans using non-range modulation PBT (NRMPBT), and range-modulation PBT (RMPBT). An additional plan using RMPBT was created to represent a re-treatment scenario (RMPBTrt) using a vertex beam. Planning statistics regarding dose, volume of the planning targets, and color images of the plans are shown.RESULTS: The three plans generated for this patient reveal that in all cases dosimetric and device manufacturing advantages are able to be achieved using RMPBT. Organ at risk (OAR) doses to critical structures such as the cochleae, optic apparatus, hypothalamus, and temporal lobes can be selectively spared using this method. Concerns about the location of the RBE that did significantly impact beam selection and treatment planning no longer have the same impact on the process, allowing these structures to be spared dose and subsequent associated issues.CONCLUSIONS: This present study has illustrated that RMPBT can improve OAR sparing while giving equivalent coverage to target volumes relative to traditional PBT methods while avoiding the increased RBE at the end of the beam. It has proven easy to design and implement and robust in our planning process. The method underscores the need to optimize treatment plans in PBT for both traditional energy dose in gray (Gy) and biologic dose (RBE)."
486,Excluded,"CBCT-guided Winston Lutz test Purpose/Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of the radiation isocenter of a linac when a Winston Lutz (WL) test is performed using the CBCT as a localization tool for the target. Material(s) and Method(s): A Varian 2100 CD linac equipped witha 120 MLC, aSi 500 EPID and OBI system (v 1.5). A phantom containing a central tungsten ball (5 mm diameter) mimicking a target is used. The phantom was CT scanned in a Siemens Somaton scanner (planning CT, pCT) and imported into the Eclipse TPS (v. 10.0). The tungsten ball was delineated and a no-coplanar plan (WL plan) was added with its isocenter located at the ball center. The WL plan consisted of 10 smallfields (6X) of 2x2 cm size collimated with the Millennium 120 MLC of the linac (G0T0,G140T315, G140T270, G180T0, G220T90, G220T45, G270T0, G270T45, G90T0 and G90T315,where G: gantry and T: table, scale: Varian IEC). The WL plan includes a CBCT field setup. The phantom was setup in the linac by aligning the ball center with the room lasers. After that, intended shifts within +/- 1 cm were applied alongside the three translational directions of the table, in order to simulate a setup error of the phantom. CBCT was acquired (Gantryrotation: 360degree, FOV: 45 cm, matrix: 512x512 and slice distance: 1 mm) and 3D/3D match was performed using the pCTas reference. The required couch movements to correct the actual position ofthe target were applied in a remote way. After that, the WL plan was delivered and an integrated MV image for each field was acquired using the EPID. EPID was positioned at 80 cm below the linac isocenter, giving a pixel size of 0.4 mm. The WL plan was irradiated twelve times during a year (118 shots/images). Each recorded MV image was analysed with ImageJ software in order to measure the distance (2D) between the ball center and the field center. Each 2D distance was decomposed into the three anatomical directions (Left/Right, Anterior/Posterior and Superior/Inferior). Result(s): The analysis of the 118 MV images collected reported the following differences (mean and 95% CI) between the ball center and the radiation center: 1) L/R : 0.6 mm [95% CI: 1.4 mm] 2) AP/PA : 0.5 mm [95% CI: 1.2 mm] 3) Sup/Inf: 0.7 mm [95% CI: 1.6 mm] Conclusion(s): The isocenter accuracy was within 2 mm on each direction, when the CBCT technique is used for target localization. The results found in this study included inaccuracies due to gantry and couch rotations, remote couch movements and potential misalignments between the linac and the OBI isocenters. Currently, we add 2 mm isotropical margin around the CTV in our cranial stereotactic procedure."

1284,Excluded,"A comparison of radiation exposure between diagnostic CTA and DSA examinations of cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While the number of CTA examinations is continually increasing compared with DSA examinations, there is little comparative dose information about the different imaging techniques. We compared patient radiation exposure resulting from diagnostic CTA and DSA examinations for both cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anthropomorphic phantom was irradiated by using typical diagnostic CTA and DSA setups and imaging parameters. For both imaging techniques, the imaging area of cerebral vessels included intracranial vessels only, while the imaging area of cervicocerebral vessels included both cervical and intracranial vessels from the aortic arch to the vertex. The effective dose was determined by using RPLDs. The DSA examination was simulated by using a biplane angiography system, and the CTA examination, by using a 64-row multidetector CT scanner. RESULT(S): For the imaging of cerebral vessels, the effective dose according to ICRP 103 was 0.67 mSv for CTA and 2.71 mSv for DSA. For the imaging of cervicocerebral vessels, the effective dose was 4.85 mSv for CTA and 3.60 mSv for DSA. The maximum absorbed dose (milligray) for skin, brain, salivary glands, and eyes was 166.2, 73.5, 35.6, and 21.8 mGy for DSA and 19.0, 16.9, 20.4, and 14.8 mGy for CTA, respectively. The conversion factors from DAP and DLP to effective dose were calculated. CONCLUSION(S): The effective dose for CTA assessment of cerebral vessels was approximately one-fifth the dose compared with DSA. In the imaging of cervicocerebral vessels, the effective dose for CTA was approximately one-third higher compared with DSA."
2031,Excluded,"Mechanisms of disease: DNA repair defects and neurological disease In this Review, familial and sporadic neurological disorders reported to have an etiological link with DNA repair defects are discussed, with special emphasis placed on the molecular link between the disease phenotype and the precise DNA repair defect. Of the 15 neurological disorders listed, some of which have symptoms of progeria, six - spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this induces. Five of the conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) display a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, four (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) exhibit an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, and four (ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) exhibit defects in genes involved in repairing double-strand breaks. The current overall picture indicates that oxidative stress is a major causative factor in genomic instability in the brain, and that the nature of the resulting neurological phenotype depends on the pathway through which the instability is normally repaired."

[German] The radioisotope cisternogram has proven itself to be a valuable diagnostic procedure during the evaluation of patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. If it is not possible to define the origin of such a leak, extensive intracranial explorations may be required, which may or may not result in successful correction of the defect. As a functional examination with limited risk to the patient and minimal radiation exposure, the isotopic cisternogram can either establish a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea or eliminate cerebrospinal fluid as a cause for rhinorrhea. When occurring, CSF leaks can be shown by demonstrating a 'path' from the cranial fossage into the nasal cavity. The present technique utilizes tampons placed in each nostril. A positive diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea is made by finding a tampon impregnated with at least twice the radioactivity of a control tampon from the opposite nostril (in the presence of an intact septum). Conclusions indicate that a positive anterior fossa cisternogram may be the only evidence for hidden site of CSF leakage, especially when other signs are lacking."

A cross-sectional study with consecutive sampling was conducted. NPC survivors were recruited from otolaryngology/oncology outpatient clinics in a medical centre in Northern Taiwan. Study measures included (1) Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire, (2) Xerostomia Questionnaire, (3) Mini Nutrition Assessment, (4) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression subscale, and (5) Symptom Severity Scale. A total of 110 subjects were recruited. Those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy had less trismus and xerostomia than patients receiving two-dimensional radiation therapy. Patients with female gender, advanced stage, completion of treatments within 1 year, higher levels of depression, more severe trismus and higher symptom severity tended to have malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition. Trismus and xerostomia are long-term problems in some NPC survivors and may contribute to malnutrition. To better manage a patient's trismus and xerostomia and to enhance nutritional status, clinicians should develop a patient-specific care programme based on careful assessment and targeted measures to improve oral function and insure adequate nutritional intake."

The photoreceptor of Euglena is characterized by optical bistability, with two stable states. In order to provide important and discriminating information on the series of structural changes that Euglena photoreceptive protein(s) undergoes inside the photoreceptor in response to light, we measured the in vivo absorption spectra of the two stable states A and B of photoreceptor photocycle. Data were collected using two different devices, i.e. a microspectrophotometer and a digital microscope. Our results show that the photocycle and the absorption spectra of the photoreceptor possess strong spectroscopic similarities with a rhodopsin-like protein. Moreover, the analysis of the absorption spectra of the two stable states of the photoreceptor and the absorption spectrum of the eyespot suggests an intriguing hypothesis for the orientation of microalgae toward light."

As a preparatory study, we conducted in-depth interviews with gynecological cancer survivors and constructed a study-specific questionnaire which we validated face-to-face. The questionnaire covered physical symptoms originating in the pelvis, demographic, psychological, and quality of life factors. In relation to the lymph system, 19 questions were asked.RESULTS: Six hundred sixteen (78 %) gynecological cancer survivors answered the questionnaire and participated in the study. Thirty-six percent (218/606) of the cancer survivors reported LLL. Overall quality of life was significantly lower among cancer survivors with LLL. They were also less satisfied with their sleep, more worried about recurrence of cancer, and more likely to interpret symptoms from the body as recurrence. Cancer survivors reported that LLL kept them from physical activity (45 %) and house work (29 %) and affected their ability to partake in social activities (27 %) or to meet friends (20 %).CONCLUSION: Lower limb lymphedema has a negative impact on quality of life among gynecological cancer survivors, affecting sleep and daily life activities, yet only a few seek professional help."
2310,Excluded,"Benefits of Early Palliative Care in the Community: A Propensity Score Matched Cancer Cohort Objective: Randomized trials of early palliative care (PC) showed patient benefits. However these benefits have not been validated in community-based cohorts. The objective is to assess the impact of early vs not-early PC among cancer decedents on the risk of receiving aggressive care (ED/hospitalization), supportive care (home care/physician home visit), or hospital death. Method(s): We took a retrospective cohort of Ontario decedents between 2004 and 2014. We identified those who were 'early' PC users (i.e. used a validated PC service between month 12-6 before death [exposure]). We used propensity score matching to identify a control group of 'not-early' PC users. We hard matched on age, sex, cancer type and stage. The propensity score included region, income, year, radiation, etc. Among those with InterRAI assessments in exposure period, we additionally controlled for health instability, and dependency, depression, cognitive performance, pain, and caregiver presence via propensity score. McNemar test used to examine differences between pairs. Result(s): 51,001 decedents received early PC vs 85,979 not-early PC (i.e. late or none). After matching among those with no interRAI assessments, we found 34,184 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal distributions of age, sex, cancer type (e.g. 25% lung cancer) and stage (e.g. 24% stage 3 or 4). Compared to not-early PC users, early PC users had a 10% lower absolute risk to die in hospital and have any aggressive care respectively and a 24% higher absolute risk to any receive supportive care. In a mutually exclusive cohort, matching among those with interRAI assessments, we identified 3,419 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal scores in health instability (e.g. 12% moderate-high CHESS score) and other interRAI scales. The outcome results were similar to the non-interRAI analysis. Conclusion(s): Using propensity score matching, decedents receiving early PC are likely to receive more supportive care and less aggressive care compared to not-early PC users. Our study uniquely focuses on a population receiving community palliative care. In a distinct sample using interRAI assessments, we control for several confounders previously unmeasured.

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 172 pathologically confirmed adult grade II-III IEPN patients from 12 institutions were eligible. Of them, 106 (61.6%) and 66 (38.4%) patients were grade II and III, respectively. For grade II and III IEPNs, 51 (48.1%) and 59 (89.4%) patients received PORT, respectively. The median dose to the primary tumor bed was 54.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy for grade II and III patients, respectively. The prognostic impact of sex, age, performance, WHO grade, location, size, surgical extent, and PORT on local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up period for survivors was 88.1 months. The 5-/10-year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 64.8%/54.0%, 56.4%/44.8%, and 76.6%/71.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant PORT significantly improved LC (P = 0.002), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.043). Older age (P < 0.001), WHO grade III (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.004), and lesser surgical extent (P < 0.001) were also negative factors for OS. Adjuvant PORT also improved LC (P = 0.010), PFS (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.069) on multivariate analysis for grade II IEPNs. Conclusion(s): This multicenter retrospective study supports the role of adjuvant PORT in terms of disease control and survival in adult grade II-III IEPNs.

998,Included,"Radiation dose response of normal brain Dose response relationships were determined after hemibrain x-irradiation of normal beagle dogs. Radiation doses of 11.5, 13.5, 14.3, and 17 Gy were delivered in a single dose and results were compared to previous studies using doses of 15 and 30 Gy. Brain injury was quantified using computed tomography (CT), with serial studies obtained monthly up to 1 year following irradiation. Quantitative endpoints included low density volume and contrast enhancement. Doses above 14.3 Gy resulted in high lethality 5-8 months following irradiation, and an LD50 of 14.9 Gy was calculated. At these lethal doses, low density volume representing edema, demyelination, and necrosis had a similar response with an ED50 of 14.6 Gy. Radiation-induced decreases in white matter density appeared 5-6 months after sublethal doses (less than or equal to 14.3 Gy) and the volume of tissue characterized by this low density increased with time and dose. This sublethal low density change had an ED50 of 12.8 Gy, and may reflect a loss or generalized atrophy of glial cells and/or myelin. These results show that: (a) the dose response curves obtained after hemibrain x-irradiation are extremely steep; and (b) at least two processes may be involved in the development of late radiation damage, one that is rapid upon onset (a ""delayed acute"" reaction) and the other which is a slower and more degenerative process."

987,Excluded,"Clival chordomas: A pathological, surgical, and radiotherapeutic review Background. The purpose of this study was to discuss the optimal management of patients with clival chordomas and provide an up-to-date review of the field. Methods. A schematic description of the anatomy of the clivus and its surrounding structures is provided based on the modular classification of the surgical corridors used in endoscopic skull base surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) techniques are described. Results. The optimal treatment is gross total resection. Recent advances in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery have allowed very high rates of macroscopic and radiographic complete tumor resection in spite of the challenging location of these lesions. When the tumor location or extension is too lateral or inferior to be effectively resected with an endoscopic approach, an open approach or a combination of endoscopic and open approaches in stages should be considered. Postoperative RT is usually indicated because the likelihood of recurrence is high in spite of complete surgical resection. The main site of recurrence is local and late recurrences are relatively common. The probability of cure is approximately 50% at 10 years and significantly increases when complete tumor resection has been achieved. Conclusion. The preferred treatment for patients with clival chordoma is gross total resection (via endoscopic endonasal surgery when possible) followed by postoperative RT. Treatment at experienced multidisciplinary cranial base centers is key to minimize complications and to enhance the probability of total removal of the tumors. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We aimed to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of placebo in terms of reduction of incidence of pain flare.METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients from 23 Canadian centres were randomly allocated (1:1) with a web-based system and minimisation algorithm to receive either two 4 mg dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets taken orally at least 1 h before the start of radiation treatment (a single 8 Gy dose to bone metastases; day 0) and then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy (days 1-4). Patients were eligible if they had a non-haematological malignancy and bone metastasis (or metastases) corresponding to the clinically painful area or areas. Patients reported their worst pain scores and opioid analgesic intake before treatment and daily for 10 days after radiation treatment. They completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life QLQ-C15-PAL, the bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22), and the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire at baseline, and at days 10 and 42 after radiation treatment. Pain flare was defined as at least a two-point increase on a scale of 0-10 in the worst pain score with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% or greater increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in the worst pain score from days 0-10, followed by a return to baseline levels or below. Primary analysis of incidence of pain flare was by intention-to-treat (patients with missing primary data were classified as having pain flare).

Two grade 3 and one grade 4 biochemical hyperglycaemic events occurred in the dexamethasone group (without known clinical effects) compared with none in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were bone pain (61 [41%] of 147 vs 68 [48%] of 143), fatigue (58 [39%] of 147 vs 49 [34%] of 143), constipation (47 [32%] of 147 vs 37 [26%] of 143), and nausea (34 [23%] of 147 vs 34 [24%] of 143), most of which were mild grade 1 or 2.INTERPRETATION: Dexamethasone reduces radiation-induced pain flare in the treatment of painful bone metastases.FUNDING: The NCIC CTG's programmatic grant from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute."
721,Included,"Effects of spaceflight on ocular counterrolling and the spatial orientation of the vestibular system We recorded the horizontal (yaw), vertical (pitch), and torsional (roll) eye movements of two rhesus monkeys with scleral search coils before and after the COSMOS Biosatellite 2229 Flight. The aim was to determine effects of adaptation to microgravity on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The animals flew for 11 days. The first postflight tests were 22 h and 55 h after landing, and testing extended for 11 days after reentry. There were four significant effects of spaceflight on functions related to spatial orientation: (1) Compensatory ocular counterrolling (OCR) was reduced by about 70% for static and dynamic head tilts with regard to gravity. The reduction in OCR persisted in the two animals throughout postflight testing. (2) The gain of the torsional component of the angular VOR (roll VOR) was decreased by 15% and 50% in the two animals over the same period. (3) An up-down asymmetry of nystagmus, present in the two monkeys before flight was reduced after exposure to microgravity. (4) The spatial orientation of velocity storage was shifted in the one monkey that could be tested soon after flight. Before flight, the yaw axis eigenvector of optokinetic afternystagmus was close to gravity when the animal was upright or tilted. After flight, the yaw orientation vector was shifted toward the body yaw axis. By 7 days after recovery, it had reverted to a gravitational orientation. We postulate that spaceflight causes changes in the vestibular system which reflect adaptation of spatial orientation from a gravitational to a body frame of reference. These changes are likely to play a role in the postural, locomotor, and gaze instability demonstrated on reentry after spaceflight."
489,Excluded,"Cross-sectional analysis of resource utilization among patients with neuroendocrine tumours Background: Although there is high morbidity and mortality associated with neuroendocrine tumours (NET), there are limited data in the literature to quantify the economic impact in this patient population. The aim of this study was to understand resource use among advanced NET patients. Material(s) and Method(s): An online survey was administered to physicians in the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, and Italy to collect data on patients with advanced NET. The survey gathered data on the incidence and frequency of resource use (e.g. chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs [SSA], PRRT). Result(s): Of the 4,100 surveys administered, 197 physicians participated (4.8%), providing data for 394 NET patients. Among all patients, nonpancreatic GI tract was the most common primary site (45.4%), followed by pancreas (30.7%). Resource utilization was high across tumour types as shown in Table 1. The most common types of chemotherapy used were: 5-fluorouracil (16.2%), etoposide (15.5%), and cisplatin (14.8%). (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): Results confirm that advanced NET is associated with significant resource use, regardless of tumour site. In addition to SSAs, patients are treated with chemotherapy and radiation-based approaches and twice as many patients are treated with targeted therapies in the pNET group as compared to the GI/Lung NET population."

To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of continuum platinum based chemotherapy versus chemo-radiotherapy in ES-SCLC in Asian Indian patient population. Method(s): Between July 2008 and December 2009, 358 patients with ES-SCLC treated with induction Cisplatin (60-80mg/m2 d1) + Etoposide (80-120 mg/m2 d1-3) x 3 cycles for every 3 weeks. Patients with CR at both local as well as distant sites or PR at the local site, but CR at distant sites were randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups (n=287). A total of 287 patients with response were randomized to accelerated hyperfraction thoracic RT (45Gy/1.5 Gy twice daily) plus PE x 4 (144) versus PE x 4 alone without radiation (n=143). The PE doses were similar as in induction. All patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation (25Gy/10 fraction/5/week). The primary endpoint was the comparison of progression free survival (PFS) between the two arms and the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS). All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 20.0. Result(s): Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Mean age was 58 years (range 32-69), 78% had ECOG 0-1; 22% ECOG 2. In the CRT arm 66.67% and in CT only arm 57.34% patients were smoker. Median PFS 15 months (CRT arm) versus 10 months (CT only) (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.56-1.18; p=0.06) and 5-year OS 10.3% (CRT arm) versus 6.2% (CT only) (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.29; p=0.47) respectively. The survival difference at 1 year was not statistically significant (39% vs 31%; HR=0.89, CI 0.69-1.13; p=0.091). The survival difference at 3 years was just significant (18% vs 11%; HR=0.83, CI 0.72-1.08; p=0.047). Local control trended better in CRT arm, but no difference in distant metastasis control in both arms. Conclusion(s): CRT arm showed better PFS and OS than CT only arm within Asian Indian patient population. Thus, the CRT may be used as a continuum treatment in Asian Indian patients of ES-SCLC after induction chemotherapy."

In the present study, our goals were to detect the functional and morphological changes that result in the administration of l-alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), a deacylated derivative of phosphatidylcholine, in a rodent model of hippocampus irradiation. Anaesthetized SPRD rats were subjected to 40-Gy irradiation of one hemisphere of the brain, with or without GPC treatment (50 mg/kg per os). After the irradiation the rats received GPC or the vehicle at the same time every second day at 5 days per week. The effects of partial rat brain irradiation on the spatial orientation and learning ability of rats were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, which was performed once before and two times after the irradiation. At the same time morphological changes were detected by MRI to define the time-point for histological examinations. Irradiation of 40-Gy resulted in moderate neurological deficit both at the level of cognitive function and morphology after 4 weeks of irradiation. The MWM test was found to be a highly sensitive tool for the detection of neurofunctional impairment. We found that the place navigational function of the ratswas impaired by the irradiation and the treatment with GPC could prevent this damage. Marked protective effect of the GPC was detected as concerns of the histopathological findings. Targeted brain irradiation induced notable changes in the central nervous system. GPC supplementation provides significant protection against irradiation-caused functional and morphological disturbances."

243,Excluded,"The hippocampus in aging and disease: From plasticity to vulnerability The hippocampus has a pivotal role in learning and in the formation and consolidation of memory and is critically involved in the regulation of emotion, fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits. Considering this framework of plasticity and vulnerability, we here review basic principles of hippocampal anatomy and neuroplasticity on various levels as well as recent findings regarding the functional organization of the hippocampus in light of the regional vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, epilepsy, neuroinflammation and aging.

(177)Lu-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC/(68)Ga-DOTATATE are used, respectively, for PRRT and PET examinations targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of the study was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the performance of (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE in the context of subsequent PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE under standardized conditions in the same patient as well as to investigate the sufficiency of standardized uptake value (SUV) for estimation of SSTR expression.METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors underwent one 45-min dynamic and 3 whole-body PET/CT examinations at 1, 2, and 3 h after injection with both tracers. The number of detected lesions, SUVs in lesions and normal tissue, total functional tumor volume, and SSTR volume (functional tumor volume multiplied by mean SUV) were investigated for each time point. Net uptake rate (Ki) was calculated according to the Patlak method for 3 tumors per patient.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in lesion count, lesion SUV, Ki, functional tumor volume, or SSTR volume between (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE at any time point. The detection rate was similar, although with differences for single lesions in occasional patients. For healthy organs, marginally higher uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE was observed in kidneys, bone marrow, and liver at 1 h. (68)Ga-DOTATOC uptake was higher in mediastinal blood pool at the 1-h time point (P = 0.018). The tumor-to-liver ratio was marginally higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC at the 3-h time point (P = 0.037). Blood clearance was fast and similar for both tracers. SUV did not correlate with Ki linearly and achieved saturation for a Ki of greater than 0.2 mL/cm(3)/min, corresponding to an SUV of more than 25.CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE are suited equally well for staging and patient selection for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE. However, the slight difference in the healthy organ distribution and excretion may render (68)Ga-DOTATATE preferable. SUV did not correlate linearly with Ki and thus may not reflect the SSTR density accurately at its higher values, whereas Ki might be the outcome measure of choice for quantification of SSTR density and assessment of treatment outcome."
1563,Included,"Sparing of tissue by using micro-slit-beam radiation therapy reduces neurotoxicity compared with broad-beam radiation therapy Micro-slit-beam radiation therapy (MRT) using synchrotron-generated X-ray beams allows for extremely high-dose irradiation. However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death. The valley doses, influenced by beam spacing and irradiated dose, could represent important survival factors for MRT."

Photobiomodulation is effective for chronic diseases because of fewer side effects than drugs. Here we investigated the effects of photobiomodulation using light-emitting diode on amyloid plaques, gliosis, and neuronal loss to prevent and/or recover cognitive impairment, and optimal timing of photobiomodulation initiation for recovering cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 5XFAD mice were used as an Alzheimer's disease model. Animals receiving photobiomodulation treatment were divided into two groups: an early group starting photobiomodulation at 2 months of age (5XFAD+Early), and a late group starting photobiomodulation at 6 months of age (5XFAD+Delay). Both groups received photobiomodulation 20 minutes per session three times per week for 14 weeks. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 10 months of age. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed after behavioral evaluation. The results showed that photobiomodulation treatment at early stages reduced amyloid accumulation, neuronal loss, and microgliosis and alleviated the cognitive dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, possibly by increasing insulin degrading enzyme related to amyloid-beta degradation. Photobiomodulation may be an excellent candidate for advanced preclinical Alzheimer's disease research."

Mucositis, a common sequel of radio- (DXR), chemo-(CXR) and radiochemo-therapy in patients with cancer, or patients requiring haemopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT), has a direct and significant impact on the quality of life and cost of care, and also affects survival--because of the risk of infection. Apart from dose reduction, preventive and treatment options for mucositis are scarce, although multiple agents have been tested. Evidence suggests that cryotherapy, topical benzydamine and amifostine might provide some benefit in specific situations. The recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor Palifermin (Kepivance) was recently approved as a mucositis intervention in patients receiving conditioning regimens before HSCT for the treatment of haematological malignancies. A number of mechanistically based interventions are in various stages of development. Unfortunately, many other approaches have not been rigorously tested.

The patients were randomized to receive two different postoperative external radiation protocols, Study Group A: Localized field external radiotherapy 50 Gy/25#/5 wks followed by Boost 10 Gy/5#/1 wk, Control Group B: Whole brain external radiotherapy 40 Gy/20#/4 wks followed by Boost 20 Gy/10#/2 wks by localized field.RESULTS: 20/25 (80%) patients in the study group and 14/25 (56%) patients in the control group showed improvement in their Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Thus a significant difference in the performance status was noted in favor of limited field irradiation. No significant difference in the local response was seen between the two groups after radiotherapy. Six months progression-free survival of the study group was 44% as compared to 26% in the control group. Six months overall survival was 66.67% in the study group and 50.72% in the control group (P<0.01). Maximum recurrences were noticed within 2 cm of the original tumor margin in both the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Although local control and survival of the patient in both the groups were same, performance status definitely improved in patients treated with localized field irradiation only."

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of structured exercise with the jaw-mobilizing device TheraBite on trismus, trismus-related symptomatology, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with head and neck cancer. Fifteen patients with trismus (maximum interincisal opening [MIO] <=35 mm) after oncologic treatment for head and neck cancer, underwent a 10-week exercise program with the TheraBite device and were followed regularly. Time between oncologic treatment and start of TheraBite exercise ranged from 0.7 to 14.8 years (average 6.2 years). MIO, trismus-related symptoms, and HRQL was assessed before and after exercise and after 6 months. A significant improvement in MIO was observed post-exercise (3.5 mm, 15.3%, p = 0.0002) and after 6-month of follow-up (4.7 mm, 22.1%, p = 0.0029). A statistically significant correlation was found between increased MIO and fewer trismus-related symptoms. In conclusion, exercise with TheraBite improved MIO and trismus-related symptoms in patients with trismus secondary to head and neck cancer. Structured exercise with the jaw-mobilizing device seems to be beneficial for patients with trismus independent of time since oncologic treatment."

[Hungarian] The aim of the study was to compare different treatment plans - intensity-modulated and conformal - for head and neck cancer patients. Treatment plans were developed for ten head and neck cancer patients by applying four different techniques: two conventional 3D conformal plans (forward treatment planning, with two opposing fields 90degree-270degree and one asymmetric anterior field, matching in isocenter /Conv/, conformal parotis sparing plans /ConPas/), 3D conformal plans with inverse treatment planning techniques /INVCRT/ and intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans /IMRT/. The plans were made for the same target volumes PTV<inf>50</inf> (elective) and PTV<inf>66</inf> (boost-16 Gy). The cumulative dose was 66 Gy, and the Philips Pinnacle3 v8.0m TPS was used for treatment planning. The organs at risk (OAR) were as follows: spinal cord, brain stem, left and right parotis and oral cavity. The dose constrains and conditions for optimization were determined for IMRT techniques with 7 fields. During the optimization we applied two different protocols: in one case the plans were made by 40 segments for ""step and shoot"" IMRT techniques and by 14 segments for INVCRT, which were converted into static fields. The homogeneity (HI) and conformity (COIN) indices were calculated for planning target volumes and the comparisons were assessed on several dosimetric parameters for OARs. The IMRT, INVCRT, Conv and ConPas techniques for PTV<inf>50</inf> planning target volume gave the following values for homogeneity index: 0.13, 0.18, 0.22, 0.19, and for conformity index: 0.76, 0.68, 0.13, 0.09. The spinal cord received a maximum of 38 Gy, 42 Gy, 45 Gy and 44 Gy for the PTV<inf>66</inf>. Mean doses of the oral cavity outside the target volume were 33 Gy, 36 Gy, 30 Gy and 48 Gy. When the 16 Gy boost treatment was applied on one side only, the mean dose for the parotis on the contralateral side was 28 Gy, 31 Gy, 49 Gy and 43 Gy, while 39 Gy, 41 Gy, 59 Gy and 53 Gy on the same side. The objectives of adequate target coverage and sparing of critical structures were fulfilled only with IMRT technique. Although the sparing of the oral cavity was the most effectively provided by the traditional technique - due to the arrangement of the fields - it gave the worst results regarding the parotis and the target volume. The highest dose for the oral cavity was given by the ConPas technique, which can cause serious early and late side effects. By increasing the number of segments for IMRT at a reasonable level, the dose for OARs can be reduced. Copyright Â© Professional Publishing Hungary."

The SEP was evoked by stimulating the ulnar nerve (U-SEP), a mixed nerve innervating the FDI muscle, the purely cutaneous nerves of the 2nd digit (D2-SEP) and the 5th digit (D5-SEP). The cutaneous reflex was recorded concurrently with D2-SEP. The size of D2- and D5-SEP significantly decreased during fatiguing contraction as compared to rest, and the decrease in both SEPs persisted throughout fatiguing contraction. In contrast, the significant decrease in the gating of U-SEP disappeared during the latter phase of fatiguing contraction. The ratio (reflex response/background EMG) of excitatory E2 (latency approximately 60-90 ms) and E3 (approximately 120-180 ms) responses following D2 stimulation significantly increased during the middle or latter phase of fatiguing contraction. In contrast, no significant changes in inhibitory I1 and I2 were seen. The release of the attenuation of U-SEP and a constant gating of the D2- and D5-SEP suggests that the brain selectively permits the muscular afferent inflow into the cortex during fatiguing contraction. An increase in the E2 and E3 reflex ratio of cutaneous reflexes during the later phase of fatiguing contraction most likely results from an increase in the excitability of the motor cortex."

The greatest decrease occurred in the globus pallidus (57.5%, P < 0.005) while the caudate nucleus only decreased to 82.6% (P < 0.05). This may correlate with proposed cholinergic extrapyramidal pathways. Ammon's horn of hippocampus decreased to 61.1% (P < 0.005) and the dentate gyrus to 71.8% (P < 0.005). These are proposed cholinergic limbic pathways from the septal nuclei. The marked effect on Ammon's horn may also relate to the specific impairment of recent memory induced by scopolamine.

The 122-da chickens typically lacked lymphoid tissue in the pineal gland with the exception of occasional LA contained in capsular tissue. Surgical bursectomy, thymectomy, or their combination at hatching followed with whole-body irradiation (IR) at 24 hours postsurgery inhibited the initial influx of lymphocytes usually seen in 9-da pineal glands. Also, these treatments prevented formation of germinal centers normally found in the pineal at 3 and 5 weeks and reduced total pineal volume at each age examined. However, pineal lymphoid volume of the surgical-IR group did not differ from control-IR chickens at either 3 or 5 weeks. Pineal glands from birds made agammaglobulinemic (bursa-cell depleted) by cyclophosphamide treatment in ovo were devoid of germinal centers, although thin strands of lymphocytes were usually found along venous sinuses. These dissociation studies suggest that the normal expression of lymphoid tissue in the chicken pineal gland is dependent on the bursa and thymus. Furthermore, these observations indicate that the pineal gland should be considered a functional component of the chicken's lymphomyeloid complex."
2952,Excluded,"Gain of rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer: relation to glutamate release and a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium current We related rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer to glutamate release by rods. Simultaneous intracellular records were obtained from dark-adapted rod-horizontal cell pairs. Steady-state synaptic gain (defined as the ratio of horizontal cell voltage to rod voltage evoked by the same light stimulus) was 3.35 +/- 0.60 for dim flashes and 1.50 +/- 0.03 for bright flashes. Under conditions of maintained illumination, there was a measurable increment of horizontal cell hyperpolarization for each light-induced increment of rod hyperpolarization over the full range of rod voltages. In separate experiments we studied glutamate release from an intact, light-responsive photoreceptor layer, from which inner retinal layers were removed. Steady light reduced glutamate release as a monotonic function of intensity; spectral sensitivity measures indicated that we monitored glutamate release from rods. The dependence of glutamate release on rod voltage was well fit by the activation function for a high-voltage-activated, dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type calcium current, suggesting a linear dependence of glutamate release on [Ca]i in the synaptic terminal. A simple model incorporating this assumption accounts for the steady-state gain of the rod to horizontal cell synapse."

282,Excluded,"Measurement of cerebral ventricular sizes and parenchymal abnormalities on bedside by ultrasound sonography in patients with craniectomy: Comparison with CCT Introduction: In patients with craniectomy ventricular size and parenchymal abnormalities are reliably estimated by CCT or MRI. Both techniques are time consuming; CCT involves frequent radiation exposure. Measurement of ventricular sizes or parenchymal abnormalities by ultrasound sonography is rarely performed. Aim of the study: To compare data of measurements of the ventricular size and anatomic structures by ultrasound sonography and CCT in patients (n = 62) with craniectomy following traumatic or vascular accidents. Method(s): Transcranial Duplex sonography (Hitachi-EUB 5000+C; 5-2/Abdominal probe; 1.4 MHz) over the craniectomized hemisphere. Documentation of land marks such as alteration of parenchymal structure, extravascular blood accumulation, hygroma, ventricular diameter, midline shift. Data of ventricular diameter were correlated with measurements obtained by CCT. Result(s): Sonography of the brain's structures and vessels by ultrasound sonography provide sharp outlined pictures which can be compared to CCT imaging with high reliability. Aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter were identified in some cases. The correlation of the diameter of the ventricles of the craniectomized and the contralateral side between ultrasound measurement and CCT was high (correlation coeffizient 0.826 for the first and 0.959 for subsequent measurements). In repetitive studies of the ultrasound measurements over a few days (without repetitive CCT), the stability of the diameter was high. Alteration of the horizontal body position between zero and 45 degrees did not affect the diameter of the ventricles. Midline shifts were detected with high reliability. Quantitative measurement of the blood flow velocity in the large intracerebral vessels using the Doppler modus was possible. Summary: B-mode ultrasound measurements of the ventricular size, the parenchyma and of the blood flow velocity in patients with craniectomy deliver reliable quantitative results for clinical neurosurgical and neurological decisions and may economize indication for frequent CCT."
2667,Excluded,"GABA-enhanced collective behavior in neuronal axons underlies persistent gamma-frequency oscillations Gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations occur in mammalian electroencephalogram in a manner that indicates cognitive relevance. In vitro models of gamma oscillations demonstrate two forms of oscillation: one occurring transiently and driven by discrete afferent input and the second occurring persistently in response to activation of excitatory metabotropic receptors. The mechanism underlying persistent gamma oscillations has been suggested to involve gap-junctional communication between axons of principal neurons, but the precise relationship between this neuronal activity and the gamma oscillation has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that gamma oscillations coexist with high-frequency oscillations (>90 Hz). High-frequency oscillations can be generated in the axonal plexus even when it is physically isolated from pyramidal cell bodies. They were enhanced in networks by nonsomatic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<inf>A</inf>) receptor activation, were modulated by perisomatic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor-mediated synaptic input to principal cells, and provided the phasic input to interneurons required to generate persistent gamma-frequency oscillations. The data suggest that high-frequency oscillations occurred as a consequence of random activity within the axonal plexus. Interneurons provide a mechanism by which this random activity is both amplified and organized into a coherent network rhythm."

3066,Excluded,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-beta2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts."
1068,Excluded,"Carotid artery revascularization through a radiated field OBJECTIVE: Extracranial carotid stenosis is a complication of external head and neck irradiation. The safety and durability of carotid artery revascularization through a radiated field has been debated. We describe the immediate and long-term results in a series of 27 consecutive patients who received treatment over 12 years.METHODS: From May 1990 to May 2002, 27 consecutive patients underwent 30 primary carotid artery revascularization procedures. All patients had received previous radiation therapy within a mean interval of 10 years (range, 1-26 years), with average radiation dose of 62 Gy (range, 50-70 Gy). Moderate to severe scarring of the skin or radiation fibrosis was present in three fourths of patients. Thirteen patients (48%) had undergone radical neck dissection, and 2 patients had a permanent tracheotomy. The indications for carotid surgery included high-grade (>70%) symptomatic stenosis in 18 patients (60%) and high-grade asymptomatic stenosis in 12 patients (40%). General anesthesia with systematic shunting was used in 18 patients (60%), and regional anesthesia with selective shunting was used in 12 patients (40%). Operations included standard carotid endarterectomy (n = 20), with patch angioplasty (n = 12) or direct closure (n = 8); carotid interposition bypass grafting (n = 7); and subclavian to carotid bypass grafting (n = 3). Primary closure of the surgical wound was performed in all procedures without any special muscular or skin flaps. All patients were followed up for a mean of 40 months (range, 3-99 months).RESULTS: There was one (3.3%) perioperative death, from massive intracerebral hemorrhage; and 1 patient had a transient ischemic attack. In-hospital complications included neck hematoma in 2 patients, which required surgical drainage in 1 patient. There was neither delayed wound healing nor infection. Twelve patients died during follow-up, of causes not related to treatment. None of the surviving patients had further stroke, and all remained asymptomatic. Follow-up duplex scans showed asymptomatic recurrent stenosis greater than 60% in 3 patients, 2 of whom with stenosis greater than 80% underwent repeat operation. Risk for recurrent stenosis greater than 60% at 18 months was 16.6%. Recurrent stenosis occurred in 2 of these patients after saphenous vein bypass, and in 1 patient after endarterectomy with vein patch angioplasty.CONCLUSION: The clinical results and sustained freedom from symptoms and stroke over 40-month follow-up suggests that carotid revascularization through a radiated field is a safe and durable procedure in patients at high surgical risk, despite a marked incidence of recurrent stenosis."

Method(s): Table 1 lists our experimental production rates for [<sup>51</sup>Mn] and [<sup>52</sup>Mn]. To optimize the production rate of [<sup>51</sup>Mn], gold target plates were electroplated with a thin layer (5 mg, 2.8mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) of Cr-50 metal and irradiated with 14 MeV deuterons as an internal slant target in the CS30 cyclotron [1]. [<sup>52</sup>Mn] was obtained after irradiation of a cup target of vanadium metal [2]. The nuclear reaction <sup>52</sup>Cr(d, n)<sup>52</sup>Mn using a slant target yielded [<sup>52</sup>Mn] (0.05 mCi/muA-h) but was contaminated with >4% [54Mn] as shown in Table 1. A semi-remote apparatus was employed to prepare sterile solutions of [<sup>51</sup>Mn] in 1M bicine, after oxidation of chromium target material and separation on a silica column [1]. The simple extraction method of Sastri [2] was used to prepare bicine solutions [<sup>52</sup>Mn] for research studies. After isolation of radionuclides, a dose calibrator setting was determined and cross-referenced with gamma ray spectral analysis. Presence of carrier manganese was determined by spot tests using SenSafe Manganese Check strips (<0.1 ppm) and validated by ion chromatography. Phantom and animal studies were performed on GE Advance and Siemens HRRT PET scanners. (Table presented) Results: Radiochemical yields and QC data for all methods are given in Table 2. Dose calibrator settings of 551 and 710/2 were determined for [<sup>51</sup>Mn] and [<sup>52</sup>Mn], respectively. With a production rate of 22.4 +/- 0.8 mCi/muA-h (n=5), a 50 min bombardment at 65 muA yielded 30 mCi (2 mCi/mL) of [<sup>51</sup>Mn] in bicine 90 min after EOB. Solutions of [<sup>52</sup>Mn] in 1M bicine were prepared from irradiated vanadium metal targets (1.5 mCi/mL) after a 12 h bombardment with 20 muA of 17 MeV 3He-particles. No carrier manganese was found in either preparation. The observed image quality for the phantom and animal studies was comparable to that of other nonconventional PET radionuclides.

2322,Excluded,"Plaque Neovascularization Is Increased in Human Carotid Atherosclerosis Related to Prior Neck Radiotherapy: A Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Study OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of radiotherapy (RT) on intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) in human carotid arteries.BACKGROUND: Exposure of the carotid arteries to RT during treatment for head and neck cancer is associated with increased risk for stroke. However, the effect of RT on IPN, a precursor to intraplaque hemorrhage and thus associated with plaque vulnerability, is unknown.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients who had undergone unilateral RT for head and neck cancer >=2 years previously underwent B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound of both RT-side and non-RT-side carotid arteries. Presence of IPN during contrast-enhanced ultrasound was judged semiquantitatively as grade 0 (absent), grade 1 (present but limited to plaque base), or grade 2 (extensive and noted within plaque body).RESULTS: Of 49 patients studied, 38 (78%) had plaques. The number of plaques was significantly greater in the RT than the non-RT arteries. Overall, 48 of 64 RT-side plaques (75%) had IPN compared with 9 of 23 non-RT-side (39%) plaques (p = 0.002). Among patients with plaques, IPN was present in 81% of patients with RT-side plaques and 41% of patients with non-RT-side plaques (p = 0.004). Grade 0 IPN was significantly more common in patients with non-RT-side plaques (25% vs. 61%; p = 0.002), whereas grade 2 plaques were more common on the RT side (31% vs. 9%; p = 0.03). The only clinical variable that predicted the presence or absence of IPN was RT laterality.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in humans to reveal a significant association between RT and the presence and extent of IPN. This may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the increased stroke risk among survivors of head and neck cancer treated by RT."
1422,Excluded,"A prospective study of thyroid function after radiotherapy for central nervous system and head and neck malignancies Purpose/Objective: Few studies evaluate endocrine gland function following radiotherapy (RT). We conducted a single-institution prospective study to understand the effect of RT on pituitary and thyroid function in adults. Material(s) and Method(s): Adult patients who received fractionated RT for non-metastatic head and neck cancer and benign intracranial neoplasms were eligible. Patients with a history of thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamic surgery or baseline hormonal supplementation were excluded. Baseline endocrine labs were obtained prior to RT and at 6- month intervals for 5 years. A dose-volume histogram report was generated for the hypothalamus, thyroid, and pituitary gland. Hypothyroidism (HT) was defined as TSH level > 5.0 mIU/L or T4 < 0.8 ng/dL. The primary endpoint was to establish the incidence and threshold dose for RT-related endocrine dysfunction. This interim analysis reports on thyroid function for the first 50 of a planned 200 patients enrolled. Result(s): From October 2006 to May 2008, 50 patients were enrolled with a median follow up of 67 months (range, 17-82 months). Forty-two patients were treated for head and neck (HN) cancers, and eight were treated for benign central nervous (CNS) tumors. No patient was on thyroid supplementation at baseline. The median prescription dose was 6000 cGy in 30 fractions (range, 4500-7000 cGy). Thirty-six patients (72%) were treated adjuvantly and 31 patients (62%) also received concurrent chemotherapy. Primary HT incidence was 60% (n=30) at a median of 12 months (range, 2.9-58.7). The 12-, 24-, 48-, and 60-month freedom from thyroid dysfunction was 78%, 52%, 47.5%, and 33.7%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (42%) received thyroid replacement therapy with a median time to therapy of 3.5 months after diagnosis of HT. The mean thyroid dose in patients with HT was 6136 cGy (range, 3958-6930) compared to 2825 cGy (range, 0-7032) for those without HT. The incidence of HT was 11% (n=2) vs. 87.5% (n=28) for patients with a mean thyroid dose below vs. above 5000 cGy, respectively (p<0.0001). No secondary HT was observed, and the mean pituitary dose for patients with HT was 1065 cGy. Significant risk factors for HT identified on univariate analysis included mean thyroid dose above 5000 cGy <0.0001), concurrent chemotherapy (p=0.029), and HN vs. CNS radiation (p=0.004). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that patients who receive a mean thyroid dose > 5000 cGy are at increased risk for primary HT after RT. Median time to HT is 12 months, but can occur as early as 3 months post- RT. Routine regular laboratory assessment with prompt appropriate thyroid supplementation is recommended."

We report an update on toxicity, quality of life (QoL), and tumor control in our magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy cohort.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Disease status was evaluated by systematic biopsies and 3T multiparametric MRI. The brachytherapy implant procedure under fused transrectal ultrasound/MRI guidance was followed by a 1.5 T MRI for contour adjustments and catheter position verification. A single dose of 19 Gy was delivered to the tumor with a margin of 5 mm. Genitourinary (GU) toxicity, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, and erectile dysfunction (ED) were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. QoL was measured with RAND-36, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and PR25. International Prostate Symptom Scores and International Index of Erectile Function scores were obtained. Prostate-specific antigen level was monitored, with biochemical recurrence defined as nadir + 2 ng/mL (Phoenix).RESULTS: Thirty patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low- (13%) to intermediate-risk (87%) prostate cancer were treated between May 2013 and April 2016. Median follow-up was 4 years. Median age was 71 years (interquartile range, 68-73) and median initial prostate-specific antigen level was 7.3 ng/mL (5.2-8.1). Maximum Gleason score was 4 + 3 = 7 (in 2 patients). All tumors were radiologic (MRI) stage T2. No grade >2 GU or >1 GI toxicity occurred. International Prostate Symptom Scores only deteriorated temporarily. Mild pretreatment ED deteriorated to moderate/severe ED in 50% of patients. Long-term clinically relevant QoL deterioration was seen in sexual activity and tiredness, whereas emotional and cognitive functioning improved. At 4 years, biochemical disease-free survival was 70% (95% confidence interval, 52%-93%), metastases-free survival was 93% (85%-100%), and overall survival was 100%. Of intraprostatic recurrences, 7 of 9 were out of field.CONCLUSIONS: Ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy conveys minimal GU or GI toxicity and has a marginal effect on QoL. An early decline in erectile function was seen. Tumor control outcomes are poor (biochemical disease-free survival of 70% [52%-93%] at 4 years), most likely as a result of poor patient selection."

Initial cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypodense area in the right parietal lobe showing no contrast enhancement. The follow-up CT done after 2 months showed an irregular, slightly hyperdense tumor surrounded by oedema with mass effect and midline shift. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed no pathological changes. Neurosurgical operation was performed and the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been established on the basis of histological and immunological investigation of the tumor. The pattern of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in the patients' bone marrow aspirate and brain tumor was identical and suggested that both tumors originated from the same B-cell progenitors. The patient was then treated with brain irradiation (2000 cGy) and complete remission as assessed by MRI was achieved.

844,Included,"Pions and pig skin: preclinical evaluation of RBE for early and late damage The skin of 50 pigs has been irradiated with negative pi mesons and with X rays in order to determine the RBE for early epidermal and later dermal damage. Late fibrosis was not studied. Four, 7, 9 and 10 fractions were used. An estimate of the RBE was made from the reactions on each pig for both early and late damage so that interanimal variability would be avoided. The data were also averaged to obtain mean dose response curves. There was no tendency for higher RBE's for late than for early skin damage. These pig studies have demonstrated an RBE of about 1.5 for early epidermal reactions and a slightly lower RBE (approximately 1.4) for later dermal damage in the same animals. This indicates that at doses of about 2.0 to 3.5 Gy pions, the medium wave skin damage is unlikely to be more severe than would be predicted from the early skin reactions and the accumulated clinical experience with X rays. However, if the trend to a steeper slope for the RBE versus dose per fraction for late injury is correct, as indicated by other published studies a relative increase in the late injury might be expected if much lower doses per fraction are used. The present clinical studies at Vancouver using 15 X 2.1 Gy pions indicate that an RBE of 1.5 is appropriate for epithelia, brain and colorectum."
2589,Included,"Proteome-wide Adaptations of Mouse Skeletal Muscles during a Full Month in Space The safety of space flight is challenged by a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that may compromise the health and performance of astronauts. The molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy and decreased performance have been studied mostly after short duration flights and are still not fully elucidated. By deciphering the muscle proteome changes elicited in mice after a full month aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, we observed that the antigravity soleus incurred the greatest changes compared with locomotor muscles. Proteomics data notably suggested mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic and fiber type switching toward glycolytic type II fibers, structural alterations, and calcium signaling-related defects to be the main causes for decreased muscle performance in flown mice. Alterations of the protein balance, mTOR pathway, myogenesis, and apoptosis were expected to contribute to muscle atrophy. Moreover, several signs reflecting alteration of telomere maintenance, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance were found as possible additional deleterious effects. Finally, 8 days of recovery post flight were not sufficient to restore completely flight-induced changes. Thus in-depth proteomics analysis unraveled the complex and multifactorial remodeling of skeletal muscle structure and function during long-term space flight, which should help define combined sets of countermeasures before, during, and after the flight."
255,Excluded,"Primary central nerous system lymphomas Purpose of review: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B cell lymphoma that occurs in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Primary ocular lymphoma represents an important variant of this disease. The outcome for patients with PCNSL is rapidly improving with new treatment strategies. This review focuses on recent advances, investigations, and controversies in the management of these increasingly important malignancies. Recent findings: The incidence of PCNSL is rising in immunocompetent patients over the age of 60 years for unexplained reasons. However, the incidence of AIDS-related PCNSL, which is related to Epstein-Barr virus infections, has fallen with the institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy. During the past decade, standard therapy has evolved from cranial irradiation to high dose methotrexate-based regimens. This shift in therapy has been associated with an increase in the median survival of patients from 1 year to longer than 3 years, and with an equally striking reduction in neurotoxicity if whole brain radiation is avoided. Optimal therapeutic results require careful attention to opportunistic infections, thromboembolic disease, and renal toxicities associated with high dose methotrexate. Summary: Overall, PCNSLs are increasing in frequency and the results of therapy for this disease have dramatically improved during the past decade. Many important therapeutic questions remain unanswered. These include the optimal dose, frequency, and duration of methotrexate, as well as the roles of additional systemic chemotherapy drugs, intrathecal therapy, and cranial irradiation. Further progress in this uncommon disease will depend on entering patients into carefully designed multicenter clinical trials to build upon the significant advances that have been made.

2622,Included,"[Histochemical and ultrastructural studies on anti-edematous and radiation-protective action of 0-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutosides on the rat brain after single irradiation. 2. Histochemical study on carbohydrate metabolism and acid phosphatase activation] The disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of acid phosphatases with and without protection by O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (HR) were studied in irradiated rat brains by means of the light microscope. The histochemically demonstrable deposition of glycogen and acid mucopolysaccharides serves as a criterion for a reversible lesion of the irradiated cerebral tissue. The extent of local activation of repair processes following to irradiation can be determined by the quantity of acid phosphatases in the lysosomes. For the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy, HR seems to exert a protective effect on the cellular metabolism of the irradiated cerebral tissue shown by a slight decrease of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide deposits compared to the untreated animals. However, when exceeding a threshold dose of 10 Gy, the deposition of carbohydrates in the HR group is strongly increased. A slightly increased activity of acid phosphatases induced by HR can be supposed at best for the dose range of 5 to 7.5 Gy. If the dose is even more increased, the reverse effect found in the carbohydrate metabolism, too, and an increased activation of acid phosphatases in the control group will be observed. This unexpected reversion of the protective effect could be related to the assumed inhibitory effect of HR on the ATPases and thus on the anaerobic part of glycolysis or to a breakdown of the cell interaction system of endothelial cells, glia cells, and neurons."

L-cysteine, a glutathione precursor, prevents oxidative damage. Transdermal patches (TDPs) loaded with L-cysteine hydrochloride (L-CyS-HCL) were fabricated by dispersion of L-CyS-HCL 5% w/w and different concentrations of sorbitol as a plasticizer in room-temperature vulcanizable synthetic silicone matrices (RTV-Si). The effect of sorbitol on patch physicochemical parameters was assessed; in-vitro L-CyS-HCL release profiles and ex-vivo permeation were studied. Pharmacokinetic parameters of endogenous synthetized in-vivo glutathione, after receiving IV bolus dose of L-CyS-HCl and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs were studied in rat model. The influence of L-CyS-HCL-RTV-Si-TDPs against damaging effects of mobile phone EMR on rats' blood and brain tissues was studied. The results revealed that patch plasticity, intensity reflections, surface porosity, L-CyS-HCL release rate and skin permeation increased with increasing sorbitol concentration. Pharmacokinetic profile for IV dose and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs revealed that the L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs provided a sustained glutathione plasma concentration-time profile over entire patch application. High significant differences in biological parameters (blood and brain samples) were observed for radiated rats using the patch in study compared with positive control rats. Promising long-term strategy for protection against mobile phone hazards was obtained. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors"

During the experiment, 23 healthy volunteers were exposed to a microwave (450 MHz) of 7 Hz frequency on-off modulation. The field power density at the scalp was 0.16 mW cm(-2). The experimental protocol consisted of ten cycles of repetitive microwave exposure. Signals from frontal EEG channels FP1 and FP2 were analysed. Smooth power spectrum and length distribution curves of low-variability periods, as well as probability distribution close to normal, confirmed that stationarity of the EEG signal during recordings was achieved. The quantitative measure of LDLVPs provided a significant detection of the effect of the stressor for the six subjects exposed to the microwave field but for none of the sham recordings. The spectral analysis revealed a significant result for one subject only. A significant effect of the exposure to the EEG signal was detected in 25% of subjects, with microwave exposure increasing EEG variability. The effect was not detectable by power spectral measures."
1807,Included,"The contribution of DNA and chromosome repair deficiencies to the radiosensitivity of ataxia-telangiectasia Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype."
2340,Excluded,"Effect of acid predissolution on fibril size and fibril flexibility of synthetic beta-amyloid peptide beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) is the major protein component of senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's patients. Several researchers have demonstrated that A beta is neurotoxic in in vitro and in vivo systems. Peptide aggregation state and/or conformation might play a significant role in determining the toxicity of the peptide. The size and flexibility of fibrils formed from the synthetic peptide beta (1-39), corresponding to the first 39 residues of A beta, were determined. Samples were prepared either directly from lyophilized peptide or diluted from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All samples had a final peptide concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, a final pH of 7.4, and a final NaCl concentration of 0.14 M. The molecular weight and linear density of the fibrils increased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA, based on static light scattering measurements. Analysis of the angular dependence of the intensity of scattered light indicated that the fibrils were semi-flexible chains and that the fibril flexibility decreased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA. There was a concomitant change in phase behavior from precipitation to gelation with the decrease in fibril flexibility."

Recombinant Ad/reporter genes driven by five different promoters; CMV, VEGF, FLT-1, DR5 and survivin were constructed. Glioma cell lines were infected with different multiplicity of infection of the (promoter) Ad or CMV Ad. Cells were then exposed to a range of radiation (0-12 Gy) at single fraction. Fluorescent microscopy, Luc assay and X-gal staining was used to detect the level of expression of related genes. Different glioma cell lines and normal astrocytes were infected with Ad survivin and exposed to radiation. The promoters were analyzed for presence of CArG radio-responsive motifs and CCAAT box consensus using NCBI blast bioinformatics software.RESULTS: Radiotherapy increases the expression of gene expression by 1.25-2.5 fold in different promoters other than survivin after 2 h of radiation. RNA analysis was done and has shown an increase in copy number of tenfold for survivin. Most importantly cells treated with RT and Ad Luc driven by survivin promoter showed a fivefold increase in expression after 2 Gy of radiation in comparison to non-irradiated cells. Presence or absence of CArG motifs did not correlate with promoter response to radiation. Survivin with the best response to radiation had the lowest number of CCAAT box.CONCLUSION: Survivin is a selective potent radiation inducible promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy and this response to radiation could be independent of CArG motifs."

2594,Included,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight."

This U.S. National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) analysis was performed to improve the evidence guiding decision-making regarding postoperative therapy for early stage LCNEC. Method(s): Overall survival of patients with pathologic T1-2aN0 LCNEC who underwent resection in the NCDB from 2003 to 2015 was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery were excluded. These prospective data were acquired by certified tumor registrars, and include over 80% of cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S. Result(s): Of the 5,177 patients who met study criteria, adjuvant therapy was given to 31% of patients (n=1585): 20% received chemotherapy (n=1039), 8% chemoradiation (n=400), and 3% radiation (n=146). In stage IA LCNEC, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival when compared to no adjuvant therapy in unadjusted analysis (five-year survival 55% vs. 53%; p=0.03) but not after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02). Of note, adjuvant chemoradiation (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.48) and adjuvant radiation (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.25) were associated with worse survival when compared to no adjuvant therapy. In stage IB LCNEC, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival when compared with no adjuvant therapy in both univariate (five-year survival 60% vs. 43%; p<0.0001; Figure) and multivariable (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.88) analyses. Conclusion(s): In this NCDB study of resected stage I LCNEC, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival after resection of stage IB but not stage IA LCNEC.

927,Excluded,"Mortality and morbidity in adult craniopharyngioma A craniopharyngioma (CP) is an embryonic malformation of the sellar and parasellar region. The annual incidence is 0.5-2.0 cases/million/year and approximately 60 % of CP are seen in adulthood. Craniopharyngiomas have the highest mortality of all pituitary tumors. Typical initial manifestations at diagnosis in adults are visual disturbances, hypopituitarism and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. The long-term morbidity is substantial with hypopituitarism, increased cardiovascular risk, hypothalamic damage, visual and neurological deficits, reduced bone health, and reduction in quality of life and cognitive function. Therapy of choice is surgery, followed by cranial radiotherapy in about half of the patients. The standardised overall mortality rate varies 2.88-9.28 in cohort studies. Patients with CP have a 3-19 fold higher cardiovascular mortality in comparison to the general population. Women with CP have an even higher risk. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
2184,Excluded,"Accurate assessment of long-term nephrotoxicity after therapy with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octreotate Objectives : Renal radiation during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) may result in glomerular damage and reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and eventually may lead to renal failure years after PRRT. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance allow only an approximate estimation of the GFR. The aim of this study was an accurate assessment of long -term changes in GFR using the 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Of particular interest was the impact of pre-existing risk factors. Methods : GFR of 75 patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octreotate (4 intended cycles at 3 monthly intervals and mean activity of 7.9 GBq per cycle) were retrospectively analyzed. A minimum follow-up of 12 months was required for patient inclusion. Mean followup duration was 20 months (range 12-48 months), with a median of 5 GFR measurements per patient. The change of GFR was analyzed by linear curve fit. Potential risk factors including DM, HTN, previous chemotherapy and decreased renal function at baseline were analyzed regarding impact on the renal function loss. Comparability of nephrotoxicity determined by 99mTc-DTPA clearance and serum creatinine (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) was also investigated. Results : A reduction of >2 ml / year in GFR was observed in 31 (42%) and > 10ml/year in 16 patients (22%). The mean and median decline in GFR was 12 and 7 ml per year respectively. However, only one patient developed serious nephrotoxicity (CTCAE grade III). Eleven patients showed an increase of > 10 ml/year in GFR following PRRT. Nephrotoxicity graded according to serum creatinine (CTCAE) was not compatible with GFR in 17% of the assessments and was underestimated by serum creatinine in 12% of patients. None of the investigated risk factors contributed to a reduction in GFR. Conclusions : Severe nephrotoxicity after PRRT with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octrotate is rare (1.3 % of patients). However, mild renal function impairment (> 2 ml/year) is common and best monitored with 99mTc-DTPA clearance."
1698,Excluded,"L3MBTL2 orchestrates ubiquitin signaling after DNA damage and predicts tumor response to radiation Purpose/Objective(s): DNA damaging agents, such as radiation, induce double strand breaks (DSBs) and are used extensively in cancer treatment. However, therapeutic resistance is often seen due to the efficient sensing and repair of damaged DNA by the complex network of signaling pathways known as the DNA damage response. Therefore, new methods of targeting DNA repair are needed to overcome resistance. In this study, we investigated the role of a novel polycomb group protein, Lethal (3) malignant brain tumor-like protein 2 (L3MBTL2), in DNA repair. We hypothesized that loss of L3MBTL2 would induce a defect in DSB repair, and sensitize cells to radiation. Materials/Methods: L3MBTL2 knockout cells were established using CRISPR. Various tagged constructs of L3MBTL2 were expressed in these cells to elucidate the function of the protein. To assess if loss of L3MBTL2 induces DNA damage, g-H2AX, a marker of DSBs, was measured via immunostaining. DSB repair capacity was assayed using immunostaining and recombination-based DNA repair assays. Cell survival was assessed by colony formation assay. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. Protein levels were assayed using immunoblotting. Protein-protein interactions were assessed using coimmunoprecipitation. Result(s): Loss of L3MBTL2 increased g-H2AX foci by 4 fold and reduced DSB-repair capacities by >90%, independent of cell cycle or transcriptional effects. Loss of L3MBTL2 markedly sensitized cells to radiation (<10% survival fraction with the combination vs. >60% with either approach alone, P < 0.01). L3MBTL2 was ubiquitinated following DNA damage and recruited a key DNA repair protein involved in ubiquitin signaling. Conclusion(s): L3MBTL2 modulates the ubiquitin signaling pathway following DNA damage and may function as a tumor suppressor. Loss of L3MBTL2 is synthetic lethal with radiation. Our results suggest that L3MBTL2 may be a novel target to overcome therapeutic resistance in sporadic cancers."

Cognitive dysfunction associated with both the disease and adverse effects of RT is one of the most concerning complication among long-term survivors. The effects of RT to brain can be divided into acute, early delayed, and late delayed. It is, however, the late delayed effects of RT that lead to severe neurological consequences such as minor-to-severe cognitive deficits due to irreversible focal or diffuse necrosis of brain parenchyma.

270,Excluded,"Scatter compensation methods in 3D iterative SPECT reconstruction: A simulation study Effects of different scatter compensation methods incorporated in fully 3D iterative reconstruction are investigated. The methods are: (i) the inclusion of an 'ideal scatter estimate' (ISE); (ii) like (i) but with a noiseless scatter estimate (ISE-NF); (iii) incorporation of scatter in the point spread function during iterative reconstruction ('ideal scatter model', ISM); (iv) no scatter compensation (NSC); (v) ideal scatter rejection (ISR), as can be approximated by using a camera with a perfect energy resolution. The iterative method used was an ordered subset expectation maximization (OS- EM) algorithm. A cylinder containing small cold spheres was used to calculate contrast-to-noise curves. For a brain study, global errors between reconstruction and 'true' distributions were calculated. Results show that ISR is superior to all other methods. In all cases considered, ISM is superior to ISE and performs approximately as well as (brain study) or better than (cylinder data) ISE-NF. Both ISM and ISE improve contrast-to-noise curves and reduce global errors, compared with NSC. In the case of ISE, blurring of the scatter estimate with a Gaussian kernel results in slightly reduced errors in brain studies, especially at low count levels. The optimal Gaussian kernel size is strongly dependent on the noise level."
1461,Excluded,"Effects of electrode-to-fiber distance on temporal neural response with electrical stimulation This paper presents an analysis of the effects of the electrode-to-fiber distance on the temporal response properties of an auditory nerve fiber stimulated by electric current pulses. This analysis was based upon results from a computational model of a mammalian auditory nerve fiber axon having 50 nodes of Ranvier, each consisting of 130 stochastic sodium channels and 50 stochastic potassium channels, making it possible to represent the temporal fluctuations of action potential initiation and conduction. A monopolar stimulus electrode was located above a central (26th) node at electrode-to-fiber distances of 1, 4, and 7 mm, while the recording electrode was located at the 36th node. Action potentials (spikes) were generated by the biophysical model using the Crank-Nicholson method to solve a diffusive partial differential equation. By observing the occurrence times of spikes in response to 2000 cathodic monophasic stimulus pulses, temporal jitter (i.e., the standard deviation of spike times) was calculated and the poststimulus time (PST) histogram was generated as well. Furthermore, by computing the PST histogram for each initiation node as functions of space (node number) and time (PST), it was shown that spike initiation was distributed not only spatially but also temporally for stimulus levels producing firing efficiencies (FEs) near 0.5. However, at levels producing FEs near 0.99, while temporal variations approached zero, the spatial distribution of initiating nodes was comparable to that observed for the FE near 0.5. As temporal fluctuations are important for speech coding in cochlear implants, we conclude that spatial characteristics of the electrode-auditory nerve fiber interface may play a significant role in influencing these stochastic temporal processes."

Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma."
468,Excluded,"[OA109] Validation of a radio-guided surgery technique based on beta-radiation: Test on ex-vivo specimens Purpose: A very promising technique for radio-guided surgery (RGS) based on beta-radiation is being developed. The lower background, with respect to the established approach with high penetrant gamma radiation, can allow for a large diffusion of such a technique and extending the RGS to cases with a large uptake of surrounding healthy organs, such as abdominal and brain neoplastic disease or tumor of infancy. Method(s): To validate the beta-RGS feasibility study, tests on ex-vivo specimens of brain meningioma and gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been performed. These clinical cases were selected between the tumors known to express receptors to a beta-emitting radio-tracer already in use in the clinical routine: <sup>90</sup>Y-labelled DOTATOC. Voluntary patients were enrolled according to the standard uptake value (SUV) and the expected tumor-to-non-tumor ratios (TNR) estimated from PET/CT images after administration of 68 Ga-DOTATOC. All of them gave written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial, already approved by the Ethics Committee. After administration of a low activity (about 2.5 mCi) of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, the extracted ex-vivo specimens and the healthy tissue around the lesions were examined to assess the correlation between the counting rates measured by the developed beta-detecting probe and the expected 90Y activity. Result(s): All the neoplastic samples were correctly identified. A dependence of the counting rate both on the volume V and on the total activity of the sample were observed. Even injecting as low as 1.4 MBq/kg of radio-tracer, tumor remnants of 0.1 ml would be detectable in few seconds. Conclusion(s): The results of the clinical tests showed the validity of the underlying assumptions and strengthening the feasibility studies already published. Small radiopharmaceutical activity is required to detect a tumor remnant as expected due to the low background rates. The negligible medical staff exposure was also confirmed. Copyright Â© 2018"
1440,Excluded,"Cochlear-implant high pulse rate and narrow electrode configuration impair transmission of temporal information to the auditory cortex In the most commonly used cochlear prosthesis systems, temporal features of sound are signaled by amplitude modulation of constant-rate pulse trains. Several convincing arguments predict that speech reception should be optimized by use of pulse rates > or approximately 2,000 pulses per second (pps) and by use of intracochlear electrode configurations that produce restricted current spread (e.g., bipolar rather than monopolar configurations). Neither of those predictions has been borne out in consistent improvements in speech reception. Neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized guinea pigs phase lock to the envelope of sine-modulated electric pulse trains presented through a cochlear implant. The present study used that animal model to quantify the effects of carrier pulse rate, electrode configuration, current level, and modulator wave shape on transmission of temporal information from a cochlear implant to the auditory cortex. Modulation sensitivity was computed using a signal-detection analysis of cortical phase-locking vector strengths. Increasing carrier pulse rate in 1-octave steps from 254 to 4,069 pps resulted in systematic decreases in sensitivity. Comparison of sine- versus square-wave modulator waveforms demonstrated that some, but not all, of the loss of modulation sensitivity at high pulse rates was a result of the decreasing size of pulse-to-pulse current steps at the higher rates. Use of a narrow bipolar electrode configuration, compared with the monopolar configuration, produced a marked decrease in modulation sensitivity. Results from this animal model suggest explanations for the failure of high pulse rates and/or bipolar electrode configurations to produce hoped-for improvements in speech reception."

Our new DOI system has 32 detectors and 32 sources; by arranging them in a specific pattern, we can cover most of the adult head.

Taking advantage of the system's larger number of sources and detectors, we explored the spatiotemporal patterns of physiological signals during rest. These physiological signals, arising from cardiac, respiratory, and blood-pressure modulations, interfere with measurement of the hemodynamic response to brain stimulation. Whole-head optical measurements, in addition to providing maps of multiple brain regions' responses to brain activation, will enable better understandings of the physiological signals, ultimately leading to better signal processing algorithms to distinguish physiological signal clutter from brain activation signals."

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no plasmacytosis and although there was a raised CSF protein concentration, no paraprotein band was detected, despite the presence of serum paraprotein. The infiltration of the dura mater is likely to have arisen by spread from contiguous bone lesions, contrasting with the pattern of spread seen in myelomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, which probably occurs through haematogenous seeding of the meninges.

The control group included 150 healthy people. Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state."

2262,Excluded,"Intrinsic and extrinsic light responses in melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells during mouse development Melanopsin (Opn4) is a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to various brain areas. These neurons are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and are implicated in nonimage-forming responses to environmental light such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment. Recent evidence indicates that ipRGCs respond to light at birth, but questions remain as to whether and when they undergo significant functional changes. We used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to engineer a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the melanopsin promoter. Double immunolabeling for EGFP and melanopsin demonstrates their colocalization in ganglion cells of mutant mouse retinas. Electrophysiological recordings of ipRGCs in neonatal mice (postnatal day 0 [P0] to P7) demonstrated that these cells responded to light with small and sluggish depolarization. However, starting at P11 we observed ipRGCs that responded to light with a larger and faster onset (<1 s) and offset (<1 s) depolarization. These faster, larger depolarizations were observed in most ipRGCs by early adult ages. However, on application of a cocktail of synaptic blockers, we found that all cells responded to light with slow onset (>2.5 s) and offset (>10 s) depolarization, revealing the intrinsic, melanopsin-mediated light responses. The extrinsic, cone/rod influence on ipRGCs correlates with their extensive dendritic stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ipRGCs make use of melanopsin for phototransduction before eye opening and that these cells further integrate signals derived from the outer retina as the retina matures."

The present study quantitatively assessed changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the learning-induced IEGs, including Arc, c-fos, and zif268, in the mouse hippocampus after cranial irradiation using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mice (male, 8-week-old C57BL/6) received whole-brain irradiation with 0 or 10Gy of gamma-ray and, 2weeks later, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) was used to induce IEGs. In the CFC task, mice evaluated 2weeks after irradiation exhibited significant memory deficits compared with sham (0Gy)-irradiated controls. The levels of mRNA encoding IEGs were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus 10 and 30min after CFC training. The mRNA levels in the irradiated hippocampi were significantly lower than those in the sham-irradiated controls. The IEG protein levels were significantly increased in all hippocampal regions, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA)1, and CA3, after CFC training. The CFC-induced upregulation of Arc and c-fos in 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi was significantly lower than that in sham-irradiated controls, although there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the learning-induced zif268 between sham-irradiated and 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi. Thus, cranial irradiation with 10Gy of gamma-ray impairs the induction of hippocampal IEGs (particularly Arc and c-fos) via behavioral contextual fear memory, and this disturbance may be associated with the memory deficits evident in mice after cranial irradiation, possibly through the dysregulation of neuronal plasticity during memory formation."
2205,Included,"Radiation induction of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Ptk-3 in normal rat astrocytes Radiation-induced gene expression was examined in rat astrocyte cultures using differential display of mRNA via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A 0.3-kb cDNA that was consistently observed in irradiated cultures but not in unirradiated cultures was cloned and sequenced. It was found to be identical to Ptk-3, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene identified recently. The protein encoded by Ptk-3 is a member of a novel class of receptor tyrosine kinases whose extracellular domain contains regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of Ptk-3 was increased in rat astrocytes by 0.5 h after exposure to 10 Gy and remained at the same elevated level for at least 24 h. The maximum increase occurred after 5 Gy. Cloning studies indicated the presence of at least two Ptk-3 mRNA transcripts, which are probably the result of an alternative splicing mechanism. The short isoform lacks a 37-amino acid sequence in the glycine/proline-rich juxtamembrane region. The splicing pattern of the Ptk-3 gene was not altered by radiation. However, the ratios of the longer to the shorter mRNA transcripts differed between adult cortex, neonatal cortex and in vitro astrocyte cultures."

We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs."
2328,Excluded,"A novel LITT treatment planning system to optimize laser ablation delivery to brain targets Purpose: Laser interstitial thermal therapy, or LITT, is a minimally invasive stereotactic tumor ablative technique. One application is treating intracranial targets. LITT systems use a laser energy probe that can be inserted into the patient, emitting near infrared laser radiation that induces necrosis in clinical targets while providing thermal damage updates via MR thermometry. The rigid laser probes range two and three mm in diameter, through which the thermal energy efficiently emits along straight-line pathways. The systems allow for varying dwell times and rates of energy deposition to assist in the ability to maximize the thermal damage to the target tissues while minimizing the damage to normal tissues. For targets that cannot be treated along a linear trajectory, multiple trajectories are necessary. However, planning systems, like those available in ionizing radiation delivery, are all but absent from the clinical setting. The goals of this project aim to provide a planning system to allow the optimization of the laser trajectory. Method(s): Twelve patients who underwent LITT therapy using traditional approaches, where the surgeon decided on laser trajectory by inspection of orthogonal radiology images were post procedure planned using a rudimentary system of LITT planning. Starting with a stereotactic planning system, a thermal dose kernel was developed. This effort has provided a rudimentary tool that yields first estimates for optimized LITT. Result(s): A conformal index was developed and evaluated for each planning technique. The average index for the simple inspection of orthogonal images based on thermal dose threshold lines was 88.4% while the conformal index of the planning system were 46.2%. Conclusion(s): As with ionizing radiation, it is anticipated that this increase in thermal optimization will translate into better tumor control and lower complications. A system, with a more precise thermal predictive algorithm and automated trajectory planning is being pursued."

The FDG avid sites were tabulated as the primary site, lower extremity, brain, and other sites. The hypothesis is that routine skull base to mid-thigh versus whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in patients with malignant melanoma will not change management.Results: Patients (26) were divided into those with primary melanoma site in either the lower extremities (six patients) or other site (20 patients). Four of the six patients with the primary site in the lower extremities also had positive findings in the ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes. One of the patients with a positive inguinal lymph node had metastatic sites in the external iliac region and lungs on the initial study. On follow-up imaging, this patient also exhibited diffuse metastatic disease, including a lower extremity. None of the remaining patients in this group had positive findings other than the primary site in the lower extremity. Of the remaining 20 patients with the primary site not in the lower extremity, one had diffuse metastatic disease that included a lower extremity. However, lower extremity involvement would not change patient management in this case. A second patient in this group had diffuse metastatic disease that also involved the brain. However, no metastatic disease was present in the lower extremities in this patient. None of the remaining 18 patients in this group had metastatic disease in a lower extremity. Two patients in the entire study group of 26 had brain metastasis on contrast-enhanced head CT, with one having multiple brain metastasis. PET failed to demonstrate some of the brain lesions. In the other patient with solitary brain metastasis detected on contrast-enhanced head CT, PET was negative.Conclusion: <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT imaging of the lower extremity may not be justified if the primary neoplasm is not located in the lower extremities. Elimination of lower extremity imaging will reduce scanning time and additional radiation exposure. Similarly, PET/CT imaging of the brain may not be justified if contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the head is already obtained since these are more sensitive."

However, the role of BUB1 in glioblastoma remains poorly investigated. In this study, clinical analyses determined significant enrichment of BUB1 in glioblastoma with direct correlation of elevated expression to poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Genetic inhibition of BUB1 in glioblastoma tumor cells via shRNA silencing diminished both proliferative ability and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of BUB1 was additionally determined to promote the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on glioblastoma tumor cells, and investigation of the underlying pathways revealed the roles of DNA mismatch repair, spliceosome and c-Myc pathways. Mechanistically, FOXM1 was determined to positively regulate transcription of BUB1 via direct promoter region binding. For validation, pharmacologic inhibition through administration of a BUB1 inhibitor demonstrated attenuated glioblastoma cellular proliferation in vitro as well as delayed tumor growth with prolonged survival in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma in the form of BUB1, which plays a pivotal role in GBM proliferative and radio-resistance capacities in a FOXM1-dependant manner."

But little is known about patient quality of life (QOL), psychophysiological response, and assessment of adverse effect from the view point of QOL. We evaluated the effects of palliative radiotherapy for cancer recurrence or metastasis on patient QOL and psychophysiology. Material and Methods A total of 67 patients who received palliative radiotherapy between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled. Patient diseases were bone metastasis in 51 patients, lymph node metastasis in 7 patients, brain metastasis in 2 patients, local recurrence in 3 patients, and the others in 4 patients. Median irradiated dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions for palliative radiotherapy. We used the questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL to evaluate patient QOL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate patient mental healthcare at the start and at the end of radiotherapy. Results As compared to scores at the start of radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, numerical rating scale (NRS) and face scale significantly decreased. On the other hand, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) did not show no changes during palliative radiotherapy. In functional scales, average scores of role functioning (RF2) and emotional functioning (EF) also improved. In symptom scales, average scores of fatigue (FA), pain (PA), and insomnia (SL) improved. In bone metastasis group, global health status / QOL (QL2), PA, and SL significantly improved. After palliative radiotherapy, anxiety score of HADS was elevated below age of 70 years. There was relationship between anxiety improvement and QOL improvement after palliative radiotherapy. Nausea and vomiting scores of EORTC-QLQC15- PAL were associated with the irradiated volume of palliative radiotherapy for pelvic region. Conclusion Patient QOL of was improved by palliative radiotherapy regardless of PS. The possibility of palliative radiotherapy having a positive influence on patient psychophysiology was also suggested in younger age."

(90)Y-Dodecanetetraacetic acid-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (SMT 487) is an SSTR radiopharmaceutical currently under investigation as a therapeutic option for neuroendocrine tumors. Although there are a variety of methods for evaluating response to a given cancer therapy, an important indicator of success is the impact on the clinical status of the patient. The purpose of this work was to develop a semiquantitative method and assess the clinical effectiveness of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors.METHODS: A scoring system was developed to evaluate clinical response that included the following parameters: weight, health status score (determined by the patient), Karnofsky score, and tumor-related symptoms.RESULTS: We applied this scoring system to 21 patients who had completed 3 cycles of therapy with (90)Y-SMT 487. Fourteen of the 21 showed a favorable clinical response, whereas 5 were clinically stable after treatment and 2 showed evidence of clinical progression. There was also a significant reduction in the amount of octreotide being used after completion of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in the 20 patients who were on this medication.CONCLUSION: Using this scoring method, (90)Y-SMT 487 appears effective in improving the clinical status of patients with (111)In-pentetreotide-positive neuroendocrine tumors."
1665,Excluded,"Growth factor gene-modified mesenchymal stem cells in tissue regeneration There have been marked changes in the field of stem cell therapeutics in recent years, with many clinical trials having been conducted to date in an effort to treat myriad diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the cell type most frequently utilized in stem cell therapeutic and tissue regenerative strategies, and have been used with excellent safety to date. Unfortunately, these MSCs have limited ability to engraft and survive, reducing their clinical utility. MSCs are able to secrete growth factors that can support the regeneration of tissues, and engineering MSCs to express such growth factors can improve their survival, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue reconstructing abilities. As such, it is likely that such genetically modified MSCs may represent the next stage of regenerative therapy. Indeed, increasing volumes of preclinical research suggests that such modified MSCs expressing growth factors can effectively treat many forms of tissue damage. In the present review, we survey recent approaches to producing and utilizing growth factor gene-modified MSCs in the context of tissue repair and discuss its prospects for clinical application.

1023,Excluded,"Dim nighttime light impairs cognition and provokes depressive-like responses in a diurnal rodent Circadian disruption is a common by-product of modern life. Although jet lag and shift work are well-documented challenges to circadian organization, many more subtle environmental changes cause circadian disruption. For example, frequent fluctuations in the timing of the sleep/wake schedule, as well as exposure to nighttime lighting, likely affect the circadian system. Most studies of these effects have focused on nocturnal rodents, which are very different from diurnal species with respect to their patterns of light exposure and the effects that light can have on their activity. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of nighttime light on behavior and the brain of a diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat. Following 3 weeks of exposure to standard light/dark (LD; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dark [0 lux]) or dim light at night (dLAN; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dim [5 lux]), rats underwent behavioral testing, and hippocampal neurons within CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) were examined. Three behavioral effects of dLAN were observed: (1) decreased preference for a sucrose solution, (2) increased latency to float in a forced swim test, and (3) impaired learning and memory in the Barnes maze. Light at night also reduced dendritic length in DG and basilar CA1 dendrites. Dendritic length in the DG positively correlated with sucrose consumption in the sucrose anhedonia task. Nighttime light exposure did not disrupt the pattern of circadian locomotor activity, and all grass rats maintained a diurnal activity pattern. Together, these data suggest that exposure to dLAN can alter affective responses and impair cognition in a diurnal animal."
1212,Excluded,"Loss of Pde6 reduces cell body Ca(2+) transients within photoreceptors Modulation of Ca(2+) within cells is tightly regulated through complex and dynamic interactions between the plasma membrane and internal compartments. In this study, we exploit in vivo imaging strategies based on genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators to define changes in perikaryal Ca(2+) concentration of intact photoreceptors. We developed double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing GCaMP3 in all cones and tdTomato in long-wavelength cones to test the hypothesis that photoreceptor degeneration induced by mutations in the phosphodiesterase-6 (Pde6) gene is driven by excessive [Ca(2+)]i levels within the cell body. Arguing against Ca(2+) overload in Pde6 mutant photoreceptors, simultaneous analysis of cone photoreceptor morphology and Ca(2+) fluxes revealed that degeneration of pde6c(w59) mutant cones, which lack the cone-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase, is not associated with sustained increases in perikaryal [Ca(2+)]i. Analysis of [Ca(2+)]i in dissociated Pde6beta(rd1)mouse rods shows conservation of this finding across vertebrates. In vivo, transient and Pde6-independent Ca(2+) elevations ('flashes') were detected throughout the inner segment and the synapse. As the mutant cells proceeded to degenerate, these Ca(2+) fluxes diminished. This study thus provides insight into Ca(2+) dynamics in a common form of inherited blindness and uncovers a dramatic, light-independent modulation of [Ca(2+)]i that occurs in normal cones."

A secondary aim was to investigate the relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures.METHODS: In total, 37 patients received voice rehabilitation post-radiotherapy and 37 patients constituted the irradiated control group. Outcome measures were mean CPPS for connected speech and ratings with the auditory-perceptual Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain (GRBAS) scale. Outcome measures were analyzed 1 (baseline), 6, 12, and 24 months post-radiotherapy, where voice rehabilitation was conducted between the first two time-points. Additional recordings were acquired from vocally healthy participants for comparison.RESULTS: CPPS values of the voice rehabilitation group and vocally healthy group were not significantly different at 24 months post-radiotherapy. Ten out of 19 patients who received voice rehabilitation yielded a CPPS value above the threshold for normal voice 24 months post-radiotherapy, compared to 11 out of 26 in the irradiated control group. No statistically significant correlations were found between CPPS and perceptual parameters of GRBAS.CONCLUSION: Voice rehabilitation for irradiated laryngeal cancer patients may have positive effects on voice quality up to 24 months post-radiotherapy. The relationship between CPPS and GRBAS as well as the applicability of CPPS for evaluation over several points of measurement needs to be studied further."

Using resin histology, the effects of radiation on the numbers of duodenal cell types and measurements of tissue areas were assessed. The results for individual parameters and for an estimate of overall damage are given in a data display, which summarises the morphological profile of the organ after both types of radiation. Damage and recovery were seen for many of the parameters studied but there was no standard response pattern applicable for all parameters. In particular, the response of individual crypt cell types could not be predicted from knowledge of the change in crypt numbers. With regard to the holistic response of the gut, neutron irradiation appeared to have caused more damage and produced more early effects than the X-irradiation. More specifically, neutron treatment led to more damage to the neuromuscular components of the wall, while X-irradiation produced early vascular changes."

However, the role of non-coding RNA and mRNA in radiation protection, especially in the nervous system, remains unknown. In this study, microarray profiles were used to determine microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of mice that were pretreated with amifostine and subsequently exposed to high-dose IR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. We found that fewer miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were induced by amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice, which exhibited antagonistic effects compared to IR, indicating that amifostine attenuated the IR-induced effects on RNA profiles. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed changes in a variety of signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses during radioprotection following amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice. Taken together, our study revealed that amifostine treatment altered or attenuated miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of exposed mice.

Compared with frame-based technique, frameless stereotaxy reduces the duration of surgical procedure and patient's discomfort, with lead placing accuracy equivalent after the learning curve. Although several studies have investigated the targeting accuracy of this technique, only a few studies reported clinical outcomes, with data of short-term follow-up. Objective(s): To assess clinical efficacy and safety of frameless bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at 1- and 3-year follow-up. Method(s): Consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS with a manual adjustable frameless system were included in the study. The data were collected retrospectively. Result(s): Eighteen PD patients underwent bilateral STN-DBS implant and were included in the study. All patients completed 1-year observation and ten of them completed 3-year observation. At 1-year follow-up, motor efficacy of STN stimulation in off-med condition was of 30.1% (P = 0.003) and at 3-year follow-up was of 36.3%, compared with off-stim condition at 3-year follow-up (P = 0.005).

Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat. Second, latency for paralysis was shortened in the lower dose range. Third, no difference in pathology between x-rays alone or in combination with hyperthermia. Fourth, hyperthermia did increase radiation carcinogenesis."

But regulatory functions and vascular system get it most of all. Commonly seen in the sample was vegetovascular dystonia, also revealed were a varying degree discirculatory encephalopathy, acute disturbances in cerebral circulation, dyscirculatory myelopathy. Vascular abnormalities may develop at any age but in young adulthood they tend to occur more frequently. Clinical manifestations of vegetovascular dystonia were characterized by profound mixed type vegetative crises. Even if treated, vegetovascular dystonia tends to acquire remittent-and-progredient course leading to decompensation very soon. Strokes run atypical course: hemorrhages occur more often than not; circulatory disorders come about against the background of normal arterial blood pressure or insignificant its fluctuations. Hemorrhage may run gradually progressing course, which fact makes their diagnosis very difficult even with modern techniques being involved in relevent studies.

A separate nozologic form, viz. that of discirculatory encephalopacy due to radiative irradiation, is suggested, as an entity worth introducing into the medical nomenclature."
2970,Excluded,"Immunocytochemistry on free-floating sections of rat brain using microwave irradiation during the incubation in the primary antiserum: light and electron microscopy We studied the effects of microwave irradiation during the incubation of free-floating brain sections with primary antibodies against gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), enkephalin and vasopressin. Vibratome sections of perfusion-fixed rat brain were incubated: (a) overnight at room temperature (20-22 degrees C), (b) during various periods of time under microwave irradiation, such that the induced temperatures did not exceed 10 degrees C, (c) same as (b) but with induced temperatures not exceeding 40 degrees C, (d) without microwave irradiation, at 4-10 degrees C (temperature control for (b)), (e) same as (d) but at 40 degrees C (temperature control for (c)). During the incubation-irradiation we continuously monitored the temperature and controlled it by cooling and by manipulating the energy output of the magnetron. The peroxidase immunocytochemical procedure was completed using for all sections the same incubation parameters. Selected GABA-immunoreacted sections were examined in the electron microscope. Incubation at 10 degrees C in the primary antiserum as short as 30 min, with or without microwave irradiation, already results in (weak) binding of the antibodies to immunoreactive structures. One or 2 h of incubation in the primary antiserum in the microwave oven at 40 degrees C or at the same temperature outside the microwave oven results in excellent staining of GABA-immunoreactive structures and of good staining of enkephalin- or vasopressin-immunoreactive structures. The ultrastructural details were much better preserved in incubated-irradiated sections than in sections incubated overnight and only slightly less preserved than in the other control sections. There is no improved penetration of the antibodies into the sections. We conclude that by using microwave technology or by raising the temperature of the incubation medium, the time of incubation, at least in these antisera, can be shortened drastically, whereas the ultrastructural details remain well preserved."
1901,Included,"Age dependence of the radiosensitivity of glial progenitors for In vivo fission-neutron and X irradiation O-2A progenitor cells are the stem cells of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. In the epithermal reactor beams used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for treatment of brain tumors, fission neutrons are a contaminating component. To estimate the radiosensitivity of the O-2A progenitors for fission neutrons, an in vivo-in vitro clonogenic assay was used. Radiosensitivity of progenitors obtained from the spinal cord of 1- or 5-day-old rats or the optic nerve of 2- or 12-week-old rats for 1 MeV fission neutrons was compared to that for 300 kVp X rays. Dose-survival curves were fitted according to the linear-quadratic model. The resulting beta component was very small to negligible. Progenitor cells obtained from rats of different ages show differences in radiosensitivity, characterized by different alpha values. RBE values for fission neutrons were 3.5 for 1-day-old spinal cord, 3.2 for 5-day-old spinal cord, 3.0 for 2-week-old optic nerve, and 4.3 for 12-week-old optic nerve. These high RBE values indicate the importance of minimizing the fast-neutron component in the epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT."
2277,Excluded,"3D cerebral angiography: radiation dose comparison with digital subtraction angiography BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As the use of 3D rotational angiography (3D RA) for the evaluation of cerebral vasculature becomes more widespread, it is important to evaluate this imaging method's effect on patient radiation dose. The purpose of the study is to measure 3D RA radiation dose as compared with biplanar digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHOD(S): The distribution and peak skin dose were measured for 3D RA and biplanar DSA by using an anthropomorphic skull phantom. In addition, the cumulative incident dose, summed over all images in each acquisition, was determined. Measurements were acquired for our facility's standard 3D RA acquisition mode (25 degrees /s rotational speed; 162 total frames) and other available acquisition mode selections. RESULT(S): For 3D RA, the skin dose was found to be distributed across the back and sides of the skull with the peak skin dose located at the center of the back of the skull. The peak skin dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 15 mGy. For a biplanar DSA run, the peak skin dose was 58 mGy, also located at the back of the skull. The cumulative incident dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 33 mGy, compared with 53 mGy for biplanar DSA. CONCLUSION(S): The patient radiation dose for 3D RA is significantly lower than for biplanar DSA, by nearly a factor of 4 in peak skin dose and 40% lower in cumulative incident dose."

Wortmannin inhibited DNA-PK and ATM activities. Cells were synchronized by hydroxyurea. Progression through the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: M059J exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle, with extreme hyper-radiosensitivity in G to early S-phase compared with the control cell line M059K. AT3BISV and AT5BIVA exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle but showed a similar pattern of cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity to that observed in LM217 or HeLa cells. In AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, radiosensitization by wortmannin was observed throughout the cell cycle and was most prominent in G1 to early S-phase. Wortmannin did not sensitize M059J to ionizing radiation in any cell-cycle phase. DNA-PK activities were not different throughout the cell cycle.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (1) non-homologous endjoining plays a dominant role in G1 to early S-phase and a minor role in late S to G2-phase in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, (2) the role of ATM in repairing double-strand breaks may be almost cell-cycle-independent and (3) the dominant role of non-homologous end-joining during G1 to early S-phase is not due to cell-cycle-dependent fluctuations in DNA-PK activity."
3084,Excluded,"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional brain positron emission tomography Reliable attenuation correction represents an essential component of the long chain of modules required for the reconstruction of artifact-free, quantitative brain positron emission tomography (PET) images. In this work we demonstrate the proof of principle of segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional (3D) brain PET. We have developed a method for attenuation correction based on registered T1-weighted MRI, eliminating the need of an additional transmission (TX) scan. The MR images were realigned to preliminary reconstructions of PET data using an automatic algorithm and then segmented by means of a fuzzy clustering technique which identifies tissues of significantly different density and composition. The voxels belonging to different regions were classified into air, skull, brain tissue and nasal sinuses. These voxels were then assigned theoretical tissue-dependent attenuation coefficients as reported in the ICRU 44 report followed by Gaussian smoothing and addition of a good statistics bed image. The MRI-derived attenuation map was then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to be used for correcting the emission (EM) data. The method was evaluated and validated on 10 patient data where TX and MRI brain images were available. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of differences between TX-guided and segmented MRI-guided 3D reconstructions were performed by visual assessment and by estimating parameters of clinical interest. The results indicated a small but noticeable improvement in image quality as a consequence of the reduction of noise propagation from TX into EM data. Considering the difficulties associated with preinjection TX-based attenuation correction and the limitations of current calculated attenuation correction, MRI-based attenuation correction in 3D brain PET would likely be the method of choice for the foreseeable future as a second best approach in a busy nuclear medicine center and could be applied to other functional brain imaging modalities such as SPECT."
1503,Excluded,"The impact of multimodality therapy of distal esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas on treatment-related toxicity and complications The benefit of multimodality therapy is clearly established for adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, but its impact on toxicity is not well defined. We reviewed data from prospective randomized trials to better define the risks of multimodality therapy. The rates of surgical mortality and complications range from 0% to 10% and 23% to 49%, respectively. Multimodality therapy increases acute toxicity. The rate of severe acute hematologic toxicity varies considerably between trials (3%-78%) and appears to be primarily attributable to chemotherapy. Common severe acute nonhematologic toxicities include esophagitis (16%-63%), infection (2%-30%), pain (3%-24%), and gastrointestinal (6%-60%) and cardiac (3%-19%) events. The individual contribution of each modality to nonhematologic toxicities is unclear, but toxicity is increased when adding radiosensitizing chemotherapy to radiotherapy. There is an acute decrease in quality of life with multimodality therapy; however, quality of life usually returns to, or exceeds, baseline by 12 months after therapy. Late toxicities are less well defined, but commonly include esophageal, pulmonary, and cardiac toxicities."

The present study proposes mathematical methods that analyse this component in human subjects, and supports experimental evidence relating to possible correlations among the responses of photoreceptoral units under a light stimulus. The investigation is organized in two parts: the first part concerns the onset and the initial slope, up to the first minimum (about 10-15 ms), the second part deals with the main portion of the wave, up to about 30 ms. In both cases, the a-waves, recorded at various levels of luminance, have been fitted with a set of appropriate functions representing possible models of physiological behaviour which would take place in the early stages of phototransduction. The statistical nature of the underlying processes is also discussed. The results indicate that correlations occur in the early stages, whereas random processes are set up later."

With long-term space travel, astronauts will be exposed to greater radiation levels. Research shows that an antioxidant-enriched diet may offer some protection against the cellular effects of radiation and may provide significant neuroprotection from the effects of radiation-induced cognitive and behavioral skill deficits. Ninety-six C57BL/6 mice (48 pomegranate fed and 48 control) were irradiated with proton radiation (2 Gy), and two-month postradiation behaviors were assessed using a battery of behavioral tests to measure cognitive and motor functions. Proton irradiation was associated with depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test, but this effect was ameliorated by the pomegranate diet. Males, in general, displayed worse coordination and balance than females on the rotarod task, and the pomegranate diet ameliorated this effect. Overall, it appears that proton irradiation, which may be encountered in space, may induce a different pattern of behavioral deficits in males than females and that a pomegranate diet may confer protection against some of those effects."
1884,Excluded,"Cutaneous pain and detection thresholds to short CO2 laser pulses in humans: evidence on afferent mechanisms and the influence of varying stimulus conditions Pain and detection thresholds to short CO2 laser pulses were studied in healthy human subjects. Pain thresholds were significantly higher than detection thresholds in both hairy and glabrous skin; in the glabrous skin both thresholds were higher in the hairy skin. The range from detection threshold to pain threshold was larger in the glabrous skin. The minimal energy per surface area needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation decreased with increasing stimulus surface, and this spatial summation effect was to equal magnitude in the hairy and the glabrous skin. With decreasing stimulus pulse duration (from 45 to 15 msec) the detection and pain thresholds were elevated: this effect was stronger on pain thresholds. With increasing adapting skin temperature, less energy was needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation. The effect of adapting skin temperature was equal on pain and detection thresholds. The conduction velocity of fibers mediating laser evoked first sensations was in the thin fiber range (less than 10 msec), according to a reaction time study. The results suggest that short CO2 laser pulses produce both non-pain and pain sensations, but that both these sensations are based on the activation of the same primary afferent fiber population of slowly conducting nociceptive fibers. Central summation of primary afferent impulses is needed to elicit a liminal non-painful sensation, and an increased number of impulses in the same fibers produces pain."

1512,Included,"Regulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis after brain irradiation PURPOSE: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels seen after radiation treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE2 production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE2 production and PGES expression.RESULTS: As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE2 levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE2 seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE2 production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities."

In contrast to such well recognized cell injury, oxidative stress plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and tumor promotion. This review examines the role of oxidative stress in initiating and promoting the establishment of normal or abnormal neuronal patterns and subsequent neurogenesis within the central and peripheral nervous system. In particular, the role of apoptosis in both normal and abnormal neuronal development and maturation will be examined with especial reference to the induction of apoptotic cell death following abusive ligand- induced ion movements. The interaction of oxidant stress and immediate-early response gene activation is discussed with further reference to the induction of apoptosis. While glutamate receptor activation appears mandatory for coordinate maturation and neuritogenesis, such neuronal survival and differentiation is intimately dependent upon the intracellular glutathione redox potential, maintained by cystine uptake. Selected examples of reactive oxygen species induced injury pertaining to developmental neurotoxicology are presented and include starvation, irradiation injury and glutamate excitotoxicity."

A patient who had received radiation therapy for pineal germinoma at age 14 developed neurological and psychiatric abnormalities after 15 years as a late delayed radiation injury. Autopsy at age 59 revealed diffuse changes in the white matter consisting in order of severity of myelin pallor, demyelination, and necrosis which were characterized by a lack of glial reaction. The cerebral cortex was relatively well preserved. As delayed radiation injuries, hyalinous changes in the vascular wall, angiomatous lesions and, fresh and old petechial hemorrhages were found. Moreover, vascular changes associated with arteriosclerosis were also present. Furthermore, a focal glial nodule was detected which was considered to be a new radiation-induced neoplasia. These findings suggest that late delayed radiation injury may slowly develop over 30 years and may involve damage to neuroglial stem cell compensation. It is also evident that arteriosclerotic changes and newly induced neoplasia may develop in delayed radiation injury cases."

The ambiguity of the psPD diagnosis confounds identification of true progression and may lead to unnecessary interventions. The association between psPD and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational (mut) status is understudied, and its incidence may alter clinical decision making. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 120 patients with IDH1-mut (n = 60) and IDH1-wild-type (IDH-WT; [n = 60]) GBMs who received postoperative CRT with TMZ at 4 academic institutions. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to identify psPD rates in routine brain MRIs performed up to 90 days after CRT completion. Result(s): Within 90 days of completing CRT, 9 GBM patients (1 [1.7%] IDH1-mut and 8 [13.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated true progression, whereas 17 patients (3 [5%] IDH1-muts and 14 [23.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated psPD (P =. 004). IDH1-mut GBMs had a lower probability of psPD (hazard ratio: 0.173, 95% CI, 0.047-0.638, P =. 008). Among the patients with radiologic signs suggestive of progression (n = 26), psPD was found to be the cause in 3 of 4 (75.0%) of the IDH1-mut GBMs and 14 of 22 (63.6%) of the IDH1-WT GBMs (P =. 496). Median overall survival for IDH1-mut and IDH1-WT GBM patients was 40.3 and 23.0 months, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion(s): IDH1-mut GBM patients demonstrate lower absolute rates of psPD expression. Irrespective of GBM subtype, psPD expression was more likely than true progression within 90 days of completing CRT. Continuing adjuvant treatment for IDH1-mut GBMs is suggested if radiologic progression is suspected during this time interval. Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The brains of wild-type (WT), untreated K3 and NIr-treated K3 mice, aged five months (thus after the onset of parkinsonian signs and neuropathology), were labelled immunohistochemically for the oxidative stress markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), hyperphosphorylated tau (using the AT8 antibody) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The average intensity and area of 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 immunoreactivity were measured using the MetaMorph software and TH+ cell number was estimated using stereology. Our results showed immunoreactivity for 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 within the SNc was increased in K3 mice compared to WT, and that this increase was mitigated by NIr. Results further showed that TH+ cell number was lower in K3 mice than in WT, and that this loss was mitigated by NIr. In summary, NIr treatment reduced the oxidative stress caused by the tau transgene in the SNc of K3 mice and saved SNc cells from degeneration.

Efforts to decrease toxicity of irradiation to normal tissue, organs and cells have led to a search for cytoprotective agent. Investigations for effective and non-toxic compounds with radioprotective capability led to increasing interest in antioxidant such as thymoquinone (TQ). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of TQ on oxidant/antioxidant systems in the tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of TQ administered by either orogastric tube or intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied.

897,Excluded,"Slice accelerated diffusion-weighted imaging at ultra-high field strength Purpose Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data with very high isotropic resolution can be obtained at 7T. However, for extensive brain coverage, a large number of slices is required, resulting in long acquisition times (TAs). Recording multiple slices simultaneously (SMS) promises to reduce the TA. Methods A combination of zoomed and parallel imaging is used to achieve high isotropic resolution dMRI data with a low level of distortions at 7T. The blipped-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) approach is used to acquire several slices simultaneously. Due to their high radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and ensuing specific absorption rate (SAR) constraints, the commonly used multiband (MB) RF pulses for SMS imaging are inefficient at 7T and entail long repetition times, counteracting the usefulness of SMS acquisitions. To address this issue, low SAR multislice Power Independent of Number of Slices RF pulses are employed. Results In vivo dMRI results with and without SMS acceleration are presented at different isotropic spatial resolutions at ultra high field strength. The datasets are recorded at a high angular resolution to detect fiber crossings.

Relevant stenosis was defined as diameter reduction > or =50%. During CTA, arrhythmias were present in 42 (30%) patients who were not excluded from the analysis.RESULTS: The assessment of stenosis or occlusion of bypass grafts resulted in a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 97%, and positive and negative predictive values of 93% and of 99%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy for the detection of graft occlusion or stenosis did not differ between arterial and venous grafts. The evaluability of bypass grafts was significantly lower in patients with arrhythmias or with heart rates > or =65 beats/min during scanning. However, in the assessment of evaluable bypass grafts, no significant differences were detected in the diagnostic accuracy in these subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective study demonstrates that 64-slice CTA is a reliable method for the assessment of bypass graft patency and stenoses even in an unselected ""real-world"" patient population."

This study analyzes the response of neonatal rat spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons in vitro to IR (wavelength = 1,863 nm) using Ca(2+) imaging. Both types of neurons responded consistently with robust intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) transients that matched the low-frequency IR pulses applied (4 ms, 0.25-1 pps). Radiant exposures of ~637 mJ/cm(2) resulted in continual neuronal activation. Temperature or [Ca(2+)] variations in the media did not alter the IR-evoked transients, ruling out extracellular Ca(2+) involvement or primary mediation by thermal effects on the plasma membrane. While blockage of Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+) plasma membrane channels did not alter the IR-evoked response, blocking of mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycling with CGP-37157 or ruthenium red reversibly inhibited the IR-evoked [Ca(2+)]i transients. Additionally, the magnitude of the IR-evoked transients was dependent on ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid-dependent Ca(2+) release. These results suggest that IR modulation of intracellular calcium cycling contributes to stimulation of spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons. As a whole, the results suggest selective excitation of neurons in the IR beam path and the potential of IR stimulation in future auditory and vestibular prostheses."

60,Excluded,"Models of bystander signalling between primary astrocytes and glioma cells: Effects on survival and migration/invasion INTRODUCTION: The goal of radiotherapy is to cause cell death in the targeted tumour field and minimize toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue."

DNA samples were isolated from whole 5-6-days adult males. The aliquots of DNA were digested by S1-nuclease. Preimaginal stage lethality increased with irradiation dose increasing. At the same time, decrease in imaginal LS (life span) was observed after irradiation with the greatest dose (4 Gy) only. Moreover, hormesis by LS has revealed: in males irradiation with 0.25, 0.75 and 1 Gy increased the mean LS, and with 0.25 and 0.5 Gy caused the maximum LS; in females exposures with 0.25, 0.75 and 2 Gy increased the maximum LS. The densitometric assay of DNA electrophoregrams showed decrease by 39.2% of the part of high-molecular-weight DNA in control as a result of S1-nuclease action. Samples of DNA from the irradiated flies were more stable to enzyme action. The higher stability of DNA originated from the irradiated flies could be the result of reparation system activation. Ultrastructural changes induced at the egg stage by irradiation at the dose of 0.75 Gy testify the increased transcriptional activity of the brain cells."

However, most radiochemistry labs have limited capability to produce a second or even multiple <sup>11</sup>C-radiochemistry runs within the same day. Thus, we have re-configured two commercial radiosynthesis modules, the TRACERLab FXC Pro module (GE Healthcare) and the Auto-Loop 11CMethylation System (Eckert & Ziegler) to perform efficient and reliable multiple radiochemistry procedures of [11 C]DPA-713 and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride for clinical use on the same day. Method(s): Two 3-way valves were installed on the FXC Pro module to connect with the Auto-Loop system for transferring either [<sup>11</sup>C]MeI or [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF for their respective reactions (See Figure 1). [<sup>11</sup>C]CH<inf>3</inf>I and [<sup>11</sup>C]CH3 OTF were produced in FXC Pro from cyclotron delivered [<sup>11</sup>C]CO<inf>2</inf> via reduction, iodination, and triflation. Further methylation with the prosthetic group in the FXC Pro: 1.0 mg of precursor (for [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride) with NaOH was dissolved in 0.4 mL acetone in the reactor. After the C-11 methylation reaction was complete, the mixture was injected onto the HPLC for purification. Auto-Loop System: 1.0 mg of precursor (for [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [11 C]raclopride) with NaOH were dissolved in 0.1 mL of 2-butanone then pre-loaded onto 2 mL loop. After [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF was trapped and reacted in the loop for 2 min, the crude mixture was injected onto HPLC for purification. Collected [11 C]DPA-713 and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride was formulated by a C18 light solid phase extraction process, eluted by ethanol, saline and filtrated through sterile GV filter. Final product quality control was performed and passed all set criteria detailed in the respective IND application approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Result(s): Radiosynthesis on both the FXC Pro and Auto-Loop System were accomplished successfully and showed reliable radiochemical yields and molar activity. (See Figure 1). The final products met all categories of quality controls criteria (pH, appearance, filter integrity test, radiochemical purity, chemical purity, endotoxin, bacteria culture test and residual organic solvent) under USP 823. The newly installed two 3-way valves were remotely operated and can easily distribute [<sup>11</sup>C]MeI or [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF either to the reactor in FXC Pro or the capillary loop in Auto-Loop System. FXC Pro can stand alone for first <sup>11</sup>C-radioparmaceutical and be quickly switched to Auto-Loop System for next 11Cradiochemistry afterward. Furthermore, there is less radiation exposure to the radiochemist when he/she is using Auto-Loop System - thus, the use of the Auto-Loop will provide a safer option when the daily <sup>11</sup>C-production frequency increases. Currently, our facility can produce 3 clinical grade of [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride on the same day but expect this number to increase in the near future. Conclusion(s): In this modified setup of both <sup>11</sup>C-radiochemistry platforms, we achieved reliable radiochemical yield and reproducible high molar activity, which can help any radiochemistry facility to expand their <sup>11</sup>C-radiochemistry production capability for clinical use."

The aim of this study is to assess the appropriate timing of WBRT for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases (BM).METHODS: There were 78 patients diagnosed with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BM in Beijing Chest Hospital between August 2009 and May 2015. 48 untreated patients who received both WBRT and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy. Prognostic factors of intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were identified by Cox proportional hazards modeling.RESULTS: Intracranial objective response rate was 81.3% and disease control rate was 93.8%. Median intracranial PFS was 10 months. Median OS was 18 months. Multivariate analysis of intracranial PFS revealed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1 (HR=30.436, 95%CI: 4.721-196.211, P<0.001) and early WBRT (HR=3.663, 95%CI: 1.657-8.098, P=0.001) had a better intracranial PFS. Multivariate analysis of OS revealed that PS 0-1 (HR=57.607, 95%CI: 6.135-540.953, P<0.001), early WBRT (HR=2.757, 95%CI: 1.140-6.669, P=0.024), and stereotactic radiosurgery (HR=5.964, 95%CI: 1.895-18.767, P=0.002) were independent prognostic factors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: Early WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs can improve outcomes of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BM, but it needs to be confirmed by large-sample-size and multicenter prospective clinical trials."
2547,Excluded,"Predicting image registration quality from the shape of the similarity metric: Potential for machine learning approaches Purpose: Typically, image guided radiotherapy relies on rigid body (RB) image registration (IR) between a reference and localisation image. Automated IR algorithms based on iterative optimisation of a similarity metric (SM) between two images are used extensively and improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process. Occasionally these algorithms do not locate the global optimum of the SM which, if undetected, could lead to a geometric treatment error. This feasibility study uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that the location of the 'found' optimum was acceptably close to the global optimum based on measures of the SM hyper-surface. Materials: Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study. The global optimum RB transform for each image pair was located by applying random misalignments before IR and calculating the average rigid body transform returned by the algorithm. A measure of target registration error (TRE) was calculated for each registration from the residual RB transform. IRs were classified as 'Good' (TRE < 0.6mm), 'OK' (0.6<TRE<2.5mm) or 'Poor' (TRE>2.5mm). The correlation ratio SM was calculated along the six cardinal axis of the RB transform space at intervals of 0.2mm. The shape of the SM was characterised by seven different measures describing minimum SM, accuracy and distinctiveness of optimum. These measures were used to train and test a Bayesian Network using K-fold cross validation. The machine learning process was repeated using just 25 points; the 'found' optimum and two points either siDe of the location of the 'found' optimum on the six cardinal axes of the RB transform.Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study.

Result(s): No single characteristic of the SM curves correlated well with TRE. However, the Bayesian Network was able to correctly classify 84% of IRs based on the detailed similarity metric profiles. No 'Poor' IRs were classified as 'Good' and vice-versa. Almost identical results were achieved with the 25 point measures but one out of 449 IRs were classified as 'Good' when actually 'Poor'. Conclusion(s): This demonstrates the potential for machine learning based on the local shape of the SM hyper-surface to check likelihood of IR accuracy using only a few calculations of the SM. Such methods could be used to reassure radiation technologists when auto-IR is successful and indicate when closer scrutiny and manual adjustment of image alignment is required."

[French] Metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) provides, in neuro-oncology, information complementary to that provided by anatomic imaging obtained with CT-scanner or MRI. Only a few publications have yet reported its use in oligodendroglial tumors. These findings and partial results obtained in ongoing work, suggest some preliminary conclusions: - 11C-MET (L-methyl-methionine) is a more appropriate tracer than 18F-FDG (fluoro-deoxy-glucose), in terms of both specificity and sensitivity, for the assessment of patients with this category of tumor; - PET/MET allows differentiation between grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas; better targeting for stereotactic biopsy; more accurate assessment of the post-operative residual tumor; identification of progression from low-grade to anaplastic grade during the disease course; differentiation between recurrence and a post-radiation processes; - PET/MET allows, to some extent, prediction of response to radiotherapy; and, probably, to chemotherapy.

1296,Excluded,"Brain enzyme histochemistry following stabilization by microwave irradiation The activities of various enzymes present in brain homogenates were assayed biochemically (a) with no pretreatment, (b) following a standard microwave treatment in saline and (c) after a standard microwave treatment in formalin. All enzyme activity was lost after the microwave - formalin in treatment. Following microwave - saline treatment, the activities of alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, isocitrate and succinate dehydrogenases were reduced. In contrast, the activities of lactate and malate dehydrogenases were unchanged, and that of acetylcholinesterase apparently increased. Analogous outcomes were seen following attempted histochemical demonstrations of these enzymes. Thus satisfactory histochemical demonstration of all enzymes was achieved (except with alkaline phosphatase, lactate and malate dehydrogenases) following the microwave-saline pretreatment. Since acid phosphatase, catalase and peroxidase were also successfully demonstrated, it seems that microwave-saline pretreatments permit both retention of sufficient enzyme activity for histochemical demonstration to occur and retention of sufficient structural integrity for critical morphological investigations. Since the failure to stain the sites of lactate and malate dehydrogenases is not due to microwave inactivation of these enzymes, their demonstration may be possible by varying the staining procedures."

The development of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in irradiated acromegaly patients is not well defined.OBJECTIVE: Detailed analysis of spontaneous 24-h GH and prolactin (PRL) secretion in relation to other pituitary functions and serum IGF-I concentrations in an attempt to find criteria for GHD in acromegalic patients with a GH response < 3 microg/l during the insulin tolerance test (ITT).DESIGN: Plasma hormone profiles obtained by 10 min sampling for 24 h in postoperatively irradiated acromegalic patients, compared with patients cured by surgery only and matched healthy controls.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: University setting. Fifteen subjects in each group.OUTCOME MEASURES: GH and PRL secretory parameters quantified by deconvolution, cluster, cosinor and approximate entropy (ApEn) analyses, IGF-I concentrations.RESULTS: Irradiation attenuated pulsatile secretion of GH and PRL, but total PRL secretion was unchanged. GH and PRL secretory regularity were diminished. Circadian timing remained intact. Pulsatile GH secretion and IGF-I were correlated (R = 0.30, P = 0.04). Criteria of pulsatile GH secretion = 12 microg/l/24 h and ApEn = 0.800 separated 12 of 15 irradiated patients from all others.CONCLUSION: Irradiated acromegaly patients with a subnormal GH response to ITT have very limited spontaneous GH secretion, with specific attenuation of the size of GH bursts and a highly irregular pattern, but with retained diurnal properties. These patients are thus likely GH-deficient and might benefit from GH replacement."
2133,Excluded,"Correlation between the Voice Handicap and Swallowing Quality of Life in patients with laryngeal cancer submitted to chemoradiotherapy Purpose To verify the correlation between the voice handicap and swallowing quality of life in individuals submitted to chemoradiotherapy for laryngeal cancer treatment. Methods Cross-sectional, observational and quantitative study. Fourteen male individuals diagnosed with laryngeal cancer were submitted to exclusive chemoradiotherapy treatment. The individuals completed the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaires. Data were submitted to descriptive and inferential analysis using Spearman's Correlation Test to verify possible correlations among the scores of these instruments. Values of p <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results No significant correlation was found between the total VHI and overall SWAL-QOL scores. However, there was significant correlation between the domain Functional of the VHI and the domains Fatigue and Social of the SWAL-QOL, between the domain Organic in the VHI and the SWAL-QOL domain Social, and total VHI score and SWAL-QOL domain Swallowing as a burden. Furthermore, chemoradiotherapy treatment had a greater impact on the voice than on the swallowing for the studied individuals. Conclusion The data showed a significant correlation between voice handicap and the impact of quality of life involving swallowing in individuals with laryngeal cancer submitted to chemoradiotherapy.

Observations: We present the case of a 20-year-old patient, diagnosed with a high-risk phy-negative, pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with a positive MLL gene rearrangement. After a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-like regimen chemotherapy protocol and a first complete remission, ALL relapse was diagnosed, so he was commenced on a FlaG-Ida protocol (fludarabine, idarubicin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and high-dose cytarabine). He achieved a second complete remission with positive minimal residual disease and was scheduled for urgent allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Five days before the conditioning regimen was initiated, the patient complained of visual loss in the left eye and then in the right eye. Ophthalmological evaluation showed a best corrected visual acuity of the right eye (OD) of 20/100 and of the left eye (OS) of 20/400. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a bilateral serous sub-foveal detachment. The sub-foveal choroidal thickness was measured by enhanced depth imaging (EDI-OCT) and showed a significant increase (OD 836 mum and OS 1036 mum) compared with normal (average 310 mum). This choroidal thickness increase, associated with the serous macular detachment, was interpreted as a choroidal leukemic infiltration. A lumbar puncture with cytologic studies and flow cytometry was performed, showing no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement of leukemia. CNS and orbital magnetic nuclear resonance imaging showed no pathology. No extramedullary involvement could be confirmed. Retinal fluorescein angiography showed multiple and diffuse leakage points (pinpoint pattern) within the macular area. This pattern reinforced our presumptive diagnosis, even though the lumbar puncture and flow cytometry were negative. The hematologist decided to proceed with the bone marrow transplant. A myeloablative conditioning regimen was delivered, based on total body irradiation (TBI) with a total dose of 12 Gy plus fludarabine 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for five days. No ocular protection was used during TBI. Only 2 h after TBI commenced, the patient reported a significant improvement in his visual acuity. We confirmed 20/20 in both eyes. The OCT showed a dramatic decrease in the choroidal thickness measurement (OD 387 mum and OS 408 mum compared with 836 mum and 1036 mum measured before radiotherapy). Conclusions and importance: Complete ophthalmological evaluation and EDI-OCT choroidal thickness measurement could be fundamental tools necessary to determine CNS involvement of ALL, even in cases with negative cerebrospinal fluid and brain imaging.

We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001). Daily life and analgesic use did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Ten to 17 years after postoperative radiotherapy 1 in 12 women had weekly pain that could be attributed to radiotherapy. The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women."
405,Excluded,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry for the Novel SV2A Radiotracer [(18)F]UCB-H: First-in-Human Study PURPOSE: [(18)F]UCB-H is a novel radiotracer with a high affinity for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein expressed in synaptic vesicles. SV2A is the binding site of levetiracetam, a ""first-in-class"" antiepileptic drug with a distinct but still poorly understood mechanism of action. The objective of this study was to determine the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [(18)F]UCB-H in a human clinical trial and to establish injection limits according to biomedical research guidelines. Additionally, the clinical radiation dosimetry results were compared to estimations in previously published preclinical data.PROCEDURES: Dynamic whole body positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was performed over approximately 110 min on five healthy male volunteers after injection of 144.5 +/- 7.1 MBq (range, 139.1-156.5 MBq) of [(18)F]UCB-H. Major organs were delineated on CT images, and time-activity curves were obtained from co-registered dynamic PET emission scans. The bladder could only be delineated on PET images. Time-integrated activity coefficients were calculated as area under the curve using trapezoidal numerical integration. Urinary excretion data based on PET activities including voiding was also simulated using the dynamic bladder module of OLINDA/EXM. The radiation dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM.RESULTS: The effective dose to the OLINDA/EXM 70-kg standard male was 1.54 x 10(-2) +/- 6.84 x 10(-4) millisieverts (mSv)/MBq, with urinary bladder wall, gallbladder wall, and the liver receiving the highest absorbed dose. The brain, the tracer's main organ of interest, received an absorbed dose of 1.89 x 10(-2) +/- 2.32 x 10(-3) mGy/MBq.CONCLUSIONS: This first human dosimetry study of [(18)F]UCB-H indicated that the tracer shows similar radiation burdens to widely used common clinical tracers. Single injections of at maximum 672 MBq for US practice and 649 MBq for European practice keep radiation exposure below recommended limits. Recently published preclinical dosimetry data extrapolated from mice provided satisfactory prediction of total body and effective dose but showed significant differences in organ absorbed doses compared to human data."

While heptamethine cyanine dye IR780 has excellent tumor targeting and imaging potential, its hydrophobic property limits its clinical use. In this study, we developed nanoparticle formulations to facilitate the use of IR780 for fluorescent imaging of malignant brain tumor.METHODS: Self-assembled IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were prepared and their NIRF properties were characterized. The intracellular accumulation of IR780-nanoparticles in glioma cells were determined using confocal microscopy. The in vivo brain tumor targeting and NIRF imaging capacity of IR780-nanoparticles were evaluated using U87MG glioma ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models and a spontaneous glioma mouse model driven by RAS/RTK activation.RESULTS: The loading of IR780 into liposomes or phospholipid micelles was efficient. The particle diameter of IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were 95 and 26 nm, respectively. While stock solutions of each preparation were maintained at ready-to-use condition, the IR780-phospholipid micelles were more stable. In tissue culture cells, IR780-nanoparticles prepared by either method accumulated in mitochondria, however, in animals the IR780-phospholipid micelles showed enhanced intra-tumoral accumulation in U87MG ectopic tumors. Moreover, IR780-phospholipid micelles also showed preferred intracranial tumor accumulation and potent NIRF signal intensity in glioma orthotopic models at a real-time, non-invasive manner.CONCLUSION: The IR780-phospholipid micelles demonstrated tumor-specific NIRF imaging capacity in glioma preclinical mouse models, providing great potential for clinical imaging and image-guided surgery of brain tumors."

The effects of Tanshinone II(A) on radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction; the expression level of nuclear factor (NF-kappabeta) p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus was measured by Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy analysis were applied to detect the expression of gamma-H2AX and p65 postirradiation.RESULTS: Radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells was detectable after irradiation. Tanshinone II(A) decreased the radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines. Further, Western blotting showed that Tanshinone II(A) could attenuate the nuclear translocation of (NF-kappabeta) p65 submit postirradiation. Immunofluorescence staining showed gamma-H2AX foci formation with p65 translocation into the nucleus postirradiation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that Tanshinone II(A) exerts anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes that might be associated with the NF-kappabeta signaling pathway. It is postulated that irradiation causes immediate cellular reaction, and that double-strand breaks trigger the molecular response that leads to NF-kappabeta pathway activation."

She had been receiving prophylactic diphenylhydantoin treatment 100 mg three times daily during radiation therapy. The extensive involvement of the oral mucosa with conjunctivitis and synechiae of the eyelids, facial swelling, and extension of the rash over the trunk and shoulders with bullous detachment of less than 10% of the total body surface strongly suggested Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by phenytoin treatment in our patient. There has been conflicting evidence on the role of radiotherapy in the increased risk of severe drug reactions. Although various authors have emphasized the augmented rate of severe mucocutaneous reactions caused by anticonvulsants given during radiotherapy and suggested discontinuing the prophylactic use of such drugs in patients with no history of seizures, others have argued in favor of prophylactic anticonvulsants. Given the high risk of seizures, reaching 20% in patients with brain tumors, and the low incidence of drug reactions, the suggestion of refraining from prophylactic anticonvulsants in the setting of primary or metastatic brain tumors is controversial."

This matched-pair analysis compared whole-brain irradiation plus radiosurgery (WBI + RS) to neurosurgical resection followed by whole-brain irradiation and a boost to the metastatic site (NR + WBI + B). Method(s): The data of 46 patients treated with WBI + RS were matched 1:1 to 46 patients treated with NR + WBI + B with respect to age, gender, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), tumor type, extracerebral metastases, and interval from first diagnosis of cancer to treatment of the metastasis, RPA class, and GPA score. Both groups were compared for local control of the treated metastasis, intracerebral control, and survival. Result(s): The 1-year local control rates were 85% after WBI + RS and 78% after NR + WBI + B (p = 0.35). The 1-year intracerebral control rates were 74% and 68% (p = 0.33), respectively. The 1-year survival rates were 64% and 58% (p = 0.70), respectively. A multivariate analysis was not performed for local and intracerebral control, because no factor achieved significance on univariate analyses for these endpoints. Improved survival was associated with KPS > 70 (p = 0.032), absence of extracerebral metastases (p = 0.003), RPA-class 1 (p = 0.014), and GPA score of 3.0-4.0 (p = 0.010). Conclusion(s): Treatment outcomes were not significantly different after WBI + RS or NR + WBI + B. Because WBI + RS is less invasive, it may be preferable for many patients with a single brain metastasis. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records were reviewed and clinical data collected on AT/RT in a 6 year period (2006-12). Histopathology slides were reviewed and relevant immunohistochemistry stains were done. Overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of factors predictive of overall survival was done by Log Rank test. Result(s): 15 patients met the study criterion (male: female=4:1). Median age at presentation was 5 years (range 0.8-8 years). Presenting complaints included vomiting (73.33%), headache (46.67%), orbital symptoms (33.33%), motor impairment (26.67%), gait abnormality (20%) and seizure (20%). Median duration of symptoms was noted to be 2 months (range 0.5-6 months). On contrast enhanced MRI of brain, tumour location was supratentorial in 60% patients and infratentorial in 40% patients. Cystic component and hydrocephalus were noted in 73.33% patients each whereas contrast enhancement and calcification were discerned in 53.33% and 40% of the patients respectively. All patients underwent tumour resection - gross total (26.67%), neartotal (13.33%) and subtotal (60%). Histopathology was confirmative of AT/RT with MIB-1 labelling index varying from 11-85% (median 45%). There was lack of immunostaining for INI-1 suggesting INI-1 mutation. Majority of tumours exhibited immunopositivity for EMA (93.33%), synaptophysin (80%), cytokeratin (66.67%), vimentin (66.7%), SMA (60%), GFAP (46.67%). Adjuvant radiation (36 Gy/20#/4 weeks to entire neuraxis followed by local boost 20 Gy/10#/2 weeks) was started in 6 patients (40%) and completed in 5 patients. Young age at presentation and poor performance status precluded the use of radiation in the remainder. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 10 (66.67%) patients. Median number of cycles given was 3 (range 1-12) with ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide) being the common regimens (26.67% and 20% respectively). After a median follow-up of 8.33 months (mean-12.27 months), median overall survival was noted to be 10 months. At last follow-up, 2 patients are in complete response, 1 patient is on treatment, 3 patients are alive with evidence of disease and 9 patients expired due to disease progression. The 1 and 2 year actuarial rate of overall survival was noted to be 48.1% and 24.1% respectively. On univariate analysis, extent of surgery (p = 0.0149), use of craniospinal radiation (p = 0.0087) and MIB-1 labelling index (p = 0.0034) were significant predictors of overall survival while age (>=5 years versus <5 years) was of borderline significance (p = 0.08). Conclusion(s): Median survival of 10 months reflects the aggressive biology of this rare neoplasm. Maximal safe resection followed by craniospinal irradiation and systemic chemotherapy with ICE or VAC regimen is a reasonable treatment strategy in this uncommon malignancy."
2085,Excluded,"Computerized tomography. [French] Computerized tomography is a valuable tool in carrying out treaments using ionizing irradiation. It determines the contour of the patient with exactitude. Within this contour it situates, respectively, the tumor which is to be irradiated and the healthy adjacent organs which are to be preserved. The study of the distribution of the doses delivered is improved, all the more so as it takes into account the variations in density of tissues it passes through which modifies the absorption of rayons. Computerized tomography linked to computerized dosimetric study permits the establishment of more precise plans of irradiation perfectly suited to each patient."
3012,Excluded,"Noisy vestibular stimulation improves autonomic and motor responsiveness in central neurodegenerative disorders The vestibular nerves are known to influence neuronal circuits in the medullary cardiovascular areas and, through the cerebellar vermis, the basal ganglia and the limbic system. By means of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), it might be possible to ameliorate blunted responsiveness of degenerated neuronal circuits of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both. We evaluated the effect of 24-hour noisy GVS on long-term heart rate dynamics in 7 patients with multi system atrophy and on daytime trunk activity dynamics in 12 patients with either levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease or levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism. Six of the latter patients were also examined for cognitive performance by means of a continuous performance test. Short-range or high-frequency fluctuations of heart rate were significantly increased by the noisy GVS compared with sham stimulation, suggestive of improved autonomic, especially parasympathetic, responsiveness. Long-range antipersistency of trunk activity patterns probed by an autocorrelation measure was significantly increased by the noisy GVS, suggestive of quickening of bradykinesic rest-to-active transitions. The mean reaction time of the continuous performance test was also significantly decreased by the noisy GVS, without significant changes in either the omission or commission error ratios, which is suggestive of improved motor execution during the cognitive task. In conclusion, the noisy GVS is effective in boosting the neurodegenerative brains of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both, including those unresponsive to standard levodopa therapy; it is also effective in improving these patients' autonomic and motor responsiveness."

Activity of <sup>192</sup>Ir was 0.31 mCi, the accumulated dose at 5 mm distance was 3060 rad after 21 days and 4680 rad after 35 days, respectively. None of the animals presented a neurological deficit, and the EEG recording was without significant changes. Histological damage which could be attributed to the radiation was not observed. Serum proteins, however, were detected immunohistochemically in reactive astrocytes (3 x), in macrophages (2 x) and as diffuse perivascular accumulation. Brain water in the white matter near the implantation site increased from 68.6 to 73.2%, corresponding to a volume increase of about 17%. There was no change in the grey matter or the opposite hemisphere. Cerebral blood flow decreased slightly but there was no relationship with the development of edema. The findings suggest that low dose rate topical irradiation of the brain produces primarily membrane-dependent changes, resulting in local brain-edema."
945,Excluded,"Patterns of care for patients with small cell lung cancer: A survey of German radiation oncology institutions on recommendations for prophylactic cranial irradiation Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC was first proposed in 1973 and is recommended for patients demonstrating good response to initial therapy. The general pattern of care amongst radiation oncologists in Germany has not been previously evaluated.We conceptualized and conducted this survey to assess patterns of care. Method(s): We surveyed radiation oncology institutions in Germany via an online questionnaire sent by e-mail to member institutions of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO e.V.). The questions were based on respondent and treatment characteristics with emphasis on prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited- and extensive-stage SCLC. Result(s):We receivedatotal of95responses (29%response rate). Of which 64were completed and returned and hence eligible for evaluation. Sixty-one percent of respondents were between the ages of 50-59, 88%with over 15 years of experience in the management of lungmalignancies. Sixtysevenpercent of the institutions stage theirpatients initially with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Of the 64 responses, 97% recommended deliveryofPCI in therapy responders with LS-SCLC compared to 67% with ES-SCLC. Interestingly, a quarter of respondents offered hippocampal-avoidance PCI with only 38% following their patients with serial brain imaging followingPCI.Neuropsychological testingwas generally not routinely performed. Conclusion(s): German radiation oncology institutions showed interesting variations in certain aspects yet in general congruence in SCLC management and PCI delivery in accordance with the updated national and international guidelines. Future randomized clinical trials will further reduce discrepancies regarding delivery of PCI especially in ES-SCLC."
2829,Excluded,"Monkey, rat, and first in human evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]PF- 06445974, a PET radioligand that preferentially labels phosphodiesterase 4B Introduction: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) metabolizes and terminates the actions of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 has four isozymes: A, B, C, and D. PDE4B and PDE4D have the highest expression in brain and are linked to cognitive deficits as well as major depressive disorder (MDD). This PET study assessed the newly developed PDE4B-selective radioligand [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 in rats, rhesus monkeys and, for the first time, humans. A concomitant goal was to determine whether [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 could accurately quantify PDE4 in human brain. Method(s): In two human subjects, two whole body PET scans for radiation exposure dosimetry and three brain PET scans for specific PDE4B quantification were performed. In the pharmacokinetic analysis, target enzyme density was quantified as total distribution volume (V ) using the two-tissue compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. In one male rhesus monkey, four PET whole body scans were performed on different days. The first scan was acquired under baseline conditions, and rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), a PDE4 inhibitor, was administered IV in the second scan. The same baseline and blocked paradigms were repeated with PF- 06445974 (0.1 mg/kg) as the blocking drug. Finally, brain PET scans were conducted in four rats. Concentration of radioactivity as standardized uptake value (SUV) was compared across conditions and species. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 readily entered human brain and showed widespread distribution, with lower binding in cerebellum. V was well identified in all examined brain regions, and V calculated from the first 90 min of scan data fell within 10%. V was highest in thalamus and striatum, broadly matching human brain RNA expression. Wholebody imaging in the two humans and one monkey was notable for early distribution in the blood pool, accumulation in target organs (i.e., brain, lung), and excretion via urinary tract. Doses in the two humans were 19.6 and 19.3 muSV/MBq, respectively, similar to the value extrapolated from monkey (16.5 muSv/MBq). In monkey blocking scans, both drugs substantially blocked brain uptake; at 60 min, rolipram blocked 78% of uptake and PF-06445974 blocked 92%. However, for the rolipram-blocked scan, radioactivity in brain increased after 20 min and returned to baseline by the end of the scan. Rats showed a similar pattern to monkey. To assess whether this was due to radiometabolite in brain or rapid rolipram clearance, a second rolipram dose was injected as a displacing agent at 120 min in a rat that had undergone pre-injection of 1 mg/kg iv. This repeat rolipram dose replenished rolipram concentrations in brain and restored its ability to block radioligand binding, proving that no radiometabolite entered rat or monkey brain. Conclusion(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 successfully imaged and quantified PDE4B in human brain. No radiometabolite contamination occurred, reflecting parent radioligand binding to PDE4 in brain. In nonhuman primates,, rolipram washed out more quickly than PF-06445974. Fig.1 In human brain, [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 had widespread distribution, with high uptake in striatum and thalamus. Fig.2 In human brain, two-tissue compartment modeling with plasma parent input was well-fitted (A). Distribution volume (V ) was well identified and stable (B)."

The ectodermic origin of melanocytes and the presence of melanin in the substantia nigra are the theoretic basis of the experimental use of this class of tracers for melanoma imaging.METHODS: Eleven patients with proven metastatic melanoma entered the study. Whole-body and planar scintigrams were performed 2, 4 and 24 hr after intravenous injection of a mean tracer activity of 205 MBq. The dosimetric evaluation was performed by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee method.RESULTS: The [123I]-(S)-IBZM scans allowed the detection of all six cutaneous lesions, five of six superficial pathologic lymph nodes, four of five pulmonary and one of two hepatic metastases. The maximum tumor-to-background ratio was 2.6 in planar images. The hepatobiliary excretion of the tracer may limit detection of intra-abdominal lesions. Dosimetry is similar to data for nononcologic patients.CONCLUSION: Although it is unclear if the mechanism of radiopharmaceutical uptake in melanoma is due to binding to membrane receptors or due to interactions with intracellular structures, radiolabeled benzamide is a promising tracer to detect melanoma."
939,Excluded,"The role of functional imaging in the diagnosis and management of late normal tissue injury Normal tissue injury after radiation therapy (RT) can be defined based on either clinical symptoms or laboratory/radiologic tests. In the research setting, functional imaging (eg, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], positron-emission tomography [PET], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is useful because it provides objective quantitative data such as metabolic activity, perfusion, and soft-tissue contrast within tissues and organs. For RT-induced lung, heart, and parotid gland injury, pre- and post-RT SPECT images can be compared with the dose- and volume-dependent nature of regional injury. In the brain, SPECT can detect changes in perfusion and blood flow post-RT, and PET can detect metabolic changes, particularly to regions of the brain that have received doses above 40 to 50 Gy. On MRI, changes in contrast-enhanced images, T(1) and T(2) relaxation times, and pulmonary vascular resistance at different intervals pre- and post-RT show its ability to detect and distinguish different phases of radiation pneumonitis. Similarly, conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI can be used to differentiate between normal tissue edema, necrosis, and tumor in the irradiated brain, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure changes in compounds, indicative of membrane and neuron disruption. The use of functional imaging is a powerful tool for early detection of RT-induced normal tissue injury, which may be related to long-term clinically significant injury. [References: 89]"

Selecting appropriate treatment remains a challenging problem for orthopedic physicians. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of minimally invasive adjustable plate and locking compression plate in treatment of unstable pelvic fractures via posterior approach.METHODS: From January 2009 to June 2012, fifty-six patients with unstable pelvic fractures were included. After at least 12-month follow-up, forty-four patients treated with two methods were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: minimally invasive adjustable plate (group A) and locking compression plate (group B). Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. The size of incision, operation duration, blood loss, duration of X-ray exposures, Majeed postoperative functional evaluation and Lindahl postoperative reduction evaluation were analyzed.RESULTS: The mean follow-up in group A was 27.3 months (range, 13-48 months), and that in group B was 21.8 months (range, 12-42 months). There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries during the operations in the two groups. In group B, malunion was observed in one patient, and infection of incision was observed in one case. The operation duration, blood loss, and size of incision of group A were significantly less than that of group B. There was no significant difference in the duration of X-ray exposures between the two groups. The Majeed functional evaluation score in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. The difference of the imaging score of the retained displacement was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Both the two methods can effectively stabilize the unstable pelvic fractures. However, the minimally invasive adjustable plate has the advantages of minimally invasive, less radiation exposure, technically safe and time saving. Minimally invasive adjustable plate is a good supplementary option for treating posterior pelvic ring injuries."

1287,Excluded,"Quantifying visual pathway axonal and myelin loss in neuromyelitis optic OBJECTIVE: To determine how optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures reflecting the health of neurons (total macular volume, TMV) and axons (retinal nerve fibre layer, RNFL) relate to MRI-derived measures of myelin (myelin water fraction, MWF) in the optic radiation (OR) of individuals with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) compared to healthy controls. BACKGROUND: NMO is an autoimmune disorder characterized by episodes of inflammation and damage to astrocytes that can result in optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis. The optic nerve is a frequent site for demyelination resulting in visual dysfunction which may be reflected by OCT measures of axonal health and MWF of the OR. DESIGN/METHODS: 8 eyes with ON (NMO<sup>1</sup>) and 12 eyes without ON (NMO<sup>2</sup>) from ten NMO patients (EDSS 2.06.0, mean age=43y, 3M/7F) and 24 eyes of twelve healthy subjects (mean age=31y, 3M/9F) were included. OCT assessment involved a Macular Volume protocol (volume of retina in the center 6mm of the macula) and a RNFL Thickness scan (3.4mm ring scan of retinal thickness around optic nerve). The MRI protocol included a 32-echo T2-relaxation GRASE sequence. Average MWF values were calculated within the OR. RESULT(S): RNFL thickness (NMO<sup>1</sup>:70.5+/-17.9mum; NMO<sup>2</sup>:91.3+/-8.7mum; controls:102.9+/-15.0mum) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.01) and controls (p<0.0001). TMV (NMO<sup>1</sup>:7.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; NMO<sup>2</sup>:8.4+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; controls:8.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.02) and controls (p<0.0001). Also NMO<sup>2</sup> had reduced TMV compared to controls (p=0.02). Decreased OR MWF was also observed in NMO (NMO:0.098+/-0.01; controls:0.11+/-0.01, p=0.02). There was a strong correlation between the OR MWF and RNFL (r=0.50,p=0.003) and TMV (r=0.60,p=0.0002). CONCLUSION(S): The correspondence between reductions in OCT measures of neuronal and axonal health in the anterior visual pathway and MRI-based measures of myelin health in the posterior visual pathway suggests that these measures may be used to evaluate disease progression and treatment approaches that promote repair."

The retrogasserian portion of the trigeminal nerve (a length of 4 mm, 2-3 mm anterior to the root entry zone) was targeted. Doses of 55 to 75 Gy were prescribed to the 100% isodose line, according to a dose escalation protocol. The patients were evaluated for the level of pain control, time to pain relief, hypesthesia, and time to pain recurrence.RESULTS: The median age was 74 years. All but 2 patients (94%) achieved a successful treatment outcome. The follow-up period was 9 to 37 months (mean, 23 months). The Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity Scale (BPS) score before radiosurgery was III in 2 patients (6%), IV in 8 patients (24%), and V in 23 patients (70%). The time to pain relief was 1 to 180 days (median, 30 days). No facial numbness was observed. Only 1 patient developed a transitory dysesthesia of the tongue. After treatment, the BPS score was I, II, or III in 31 patients (97%). Pain recurred in 33% (11 patients) at a mean of 9 months (range, 1-43 months). Three patients with recurrences had low pain control by medication (BPS score, IV), and 1 patient (BPS score, V) needed a radiofrequency lesioning (BPS score, I at 12 months).CONCLUSION: CyberKnife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia allows pain relief at safe doses and is suggested for pharmacologically refractory trigeminal neuralgia. Higher prescribed doses were not associated with improvement in pain relief or recurrence rate."

In this experiment, the effect of repeated, acute exposure to a low intensity 900 MHz radiofrequency (RF) field pulsed at 217 Hz was explored using an appetitively-motivated spatial learning and working memory task. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed under far field conditions in a GTEM cell for 45 min each day for 10 days at an average whole-body specific energy absorption rate (SAR) of 0.05 W/kg. Their performance in an 8-arm radial maze was compared to that of sham-exposed control animals. All behavioral assessments were performed without handlers having knowledge of the exposure status of the animals. Animals were tested in the maze immediately following exposure or after a delay of 15 or 30 min. No significant field-dependent effects on performance were observed in choice accuracy or in total times to complete the task across the experiment. These results suggest that exposure to RF radiation simulating a digital wireless telephone (GSM) signal under the conditions of this experiment does not affect the acquisition of the learned response. Further studies are planned to explore the effects of other SARs on learned behavior. Bioelectromagnetics 21:151-158, 2000. Published 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

To benchmark both gel dosimeters, they were exposed to a 6 MV photon beam and the depth dose was compared against a diamond detector measurement that served as golden standard. Both gel dosimeters were found accurate within 4% accuracy. In the 3D dose matrix of the radiochromic gel, hotspot dose deviations up to 8% were observed which are attributed to the fabrication procedure. The polymer gel readout was shown to be sensitive to B0 field and B1 field non-uniformities as well as temperature variations during scanning. The performance of the two gel dosimeters was also evaluated for a brain tumour IMRT treatment. Both gel measured dose distributions were compared against treatment planning system predicted dose maps which were validated independently with ion chamber measurements and portal dosimetry. In the radiochromic gel measurement, two sources of deviations could be identified. Firstly, the dose in a cluster of voxels near the edge of the phantom deviated from the planned dose. Secondly, the presence of dose hotspots in the order of 10% related to inhomogeneities in the gel limit the clinical acceptance of this dosimetry technique. Based on the results of the micelle gel dosimeter prototype presented here, chemical optimization will be subject of future work. Polymer gel dosimetry is capable of measuring the absolute dose in the whole 3D volume within 5% accuracy. A temperature stabilization technique is incorporated to increase the accuracy during short measurements, however keeping the temperature stable during long measurement times in both calibration phantoms and the volumetric phantom is more challenging. The sensitivity of MRI readout to minimal temperature fluctuations is demonstrated which proves the need for adequate compensation strategies."

All these patients developed tumours within the previous radiation field and satisfied the criteria used for the definition of radiation-induced neoplasm. The interval between the irradiation and the onset of meningioma was significantly less in the younger patient. All the cases had several unique features of radiation-induced meningioma including features of atypical meningioma. Two patients developed multiple site meningiomas and one patient developed early recurrence of the tumour. This report confirms that patients exposed to cranial irradiation are at lifelong risk of developing radiation-induced tumours such as meningiomas. Hence these patients require long-term clinical and radiological surveillance to detect occurrence as early as possible."
1957,Included,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature."

After incubation for 72 h with or without inhibitors of p53, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other kinases, the neuronal differentiation of irradiated Neuro-2a cells was examined through analyzing neurite outgrowth and neuronal maker expression and the activation of related signaling proteins by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. The change of neuronal marker was examined using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The irradiation of Neuro-2a cells significantly increased the neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuronal markers (neuronal nuclei [NeuN], microtubule-associated protein 2 [Map2], growth associated protein-43 [GAP-43], and Ras-related protein 13 [Rab13]). Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells."

In the flow rats, the absolute mass of postural muscles remained unchanged while their relative mass increased; this may be attributed to their enhanced hydration which developed during the first 2 days after landing. Strength losses of the postural muscles were less significant than after previous flights. Comparison of the Cosmos-1887 and hypokinesia control data has shown that even 2-day exposure to 1 G after 13-day flight can modify drastically flight-induced changes."
840,Included,"Increased risk of ischemic stroke after radiotherapy on the neck in patients younger than 60 years PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in patients irradiated for head and neck tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of ischemic stroke was determined in 367 patients with head and neck tumors (162 larynx carcinomas, 114 pleomorphic adenomas, and 91 parotid carcinomas) who had been treated with local radiotherapy (RT) at an age younger than 60 years. Relative risk (RR) of ischemic stroke was determined by comparison with population rates from a stroke-incidence register, adjusted for sex and age. Other risk factors for stroke (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus [DM]) were registered. The median follow-up time after RT was 7.7 years (3,011 person-years of follow-up).RESULTS: Fourteen cases of stroke occurred (expected, 2.5; RR, 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 9.4): eight in patients with laryngeal carcinoma (expected,1.56; RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.1), four in pleomorphic adenoma patients (expected, 0.71; RR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.5), and two in parotid carcinoma patients (expected, 0.24; RR, 8.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 30.6). Five of six strokes in patients irradiated for a parotid tumor occurred at the ipsilateral side. Analysis of other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease showed hypertension and DM to cause an increase of the RR after RT. After more than 10 years' follow-up, the RR was 10.1 (95% CI, 4.4 to 20.0). The 15-year cumulative risk of stroke after RT on the neck was 12.0% (95% CI, 6.5% to 21.4%).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an increased risk of stroke after RT on the neck. During medical follow-up, preventive measures should be taken to reduce the impact of the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, to decrease stroke in these patients."

Exposure to these particles can affect the ability of rats to perform a variety of tasks, indicating that there is the possibility that the performance capabilities of astronauts may be affected. Previous research has shown that diets containing blueberry or strawberry extract can ameliorate the deficits produced by irradiation using a ground-based analog for exposure to cosmic rays. Rats were placed on diets containing 2% blueberry or strawberry extract for 2 months prior to exposure to 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe particles. There were no effects on performance of any group of animals when tested on an ascending fixed-ratio operant task 6 months following exposure. When tested 12 months after exposure, the performance of the radiated animals given blueberry extract did not differ from the radiated animals fed the control diet. Both groups performed significantly poorer than the non-irradiated controls. There were no differences between the non-irradiated animals fed control diet and the radiated animals fed the strawberry diet and their performance was significantly better than of the radiated rats fed the blueberry or control diets. The results indicate that diets containing strawberry extract may provide a significant level of radiation protection on exploratory class missions."

565,Included,"Upregulation of Connexin-43 is Critical for Irradiation-induced Neuroinflammation BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of pituitary adenomas. Unfortunately, it might raise the risk of ischemic stroke, with neuroinflammation being a major pathological process. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system and have been reported for playing important roles in ischemic stroke.OBJECTIVE: Here we studied how gamma-radiation would introduce astrocytes into a detrimental state for neuroinflammation and provide new theory evidence and target for the clinical management of inflammation- related neural damage after radiation-induced ischemic stroke.METHOD: HA-1800 cells were treated with gamma-radiation and then the protein and mRNA levels of Connexin (Cx)-43 were evaluated by western and q-PCR. The culture supernatant was collected and the concentrations of the inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. MiRNA complementary to Cx-43 was designed through the online tools.RESULTS: Cx-43 is upregulated in the treatment of gamma-radiation in astrocytes and gamma-radiation introduced the detrimental function of astrocytes: cell viability was reduced while the apoptotic cells were increased. Inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin 1-beta were dramatically up-regulated by the irradiation. MiR-374a rescued irradiation induced Cx-43 up-regulation of astrocytes and eliminated detrimental function triggered by gamma-radiation.CONCLUSION: Cx-43 expression level may play an important role in the inflammation-related neural damage after irradiation-induced ischemic stroke."

[Chinese] BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The recurrence rate in skull base is high for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHOD(S): A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULT(S): The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084). The median disease-freely survival time was longer in boost group than in control group (60 months vs. 30 months). The prevalences of irradiation-induced brain damage were 7.4% in boost group and 4.3% in control group with no significant difference (P=0.514). CONCLUSION(S): Dose boost in skull base can reduce the recurrence of stage T4 NPC in skull base and tends to enhance the disease-freely survival rate for NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvementu it is recommended to such patients."
2850,Excluded,"Chronic morphine exposure impairs short-term synaptic depression of geniculo-cortical visual pathway in vivo Chronic morphine exposure can induce addiction and affect synaptic plasticity, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Two forms of short-term synaptic depression (paired-pulse depression (PPD) and frequency depression) were investigated in vivo in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway of morphine-treated and saline-treated (as control) adult rats. Acute exposure to morphine had no effect on paired-pulse synaptic depression and 10-40 Hz induced frequency synaptic depression. However, chronic morphine exposure reduced markedly the paired-pulse depression and frequency depression at 40 Hz. The effect of chronic morphine exposure on short-term synaptic plasticity in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway was sensitization given that morphine re-exposure further significantly reduced the short-term synaptic depression. Interestingly, the further reduction in short-term synaptic depression due to re-exposure of morphine was recovered to normal (control) levels at 3 to 6h after morphine re-exposure. These findings suggest that chronic morphine treatment could significantly degrade the short-term synaptic plasticity of geniculo-cortical visual pathway."

2625,Excluded,"Hydrocephalus in radiation leukoencephalopathy: results of ventriculoperitoneal shunting OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical benefit of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in patients suffering from radiotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy.DESIGN: Retrospective review of a single institutional experience.PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with the postradiotherapy syndrome received ventriculoperitoneal shunts. All had a history of cranial irradiation, progressive ventriculomegaly visible on neuroimaging scans, and neurologic decline; other causes of hydrocephalus were excluded. All 31 patients had cognitive deficits: 30 had gait disturbance and 24 were incontinent.RESULTS: Twenty-four (80%) of 30 assessable patients achieved symptomatic improvement an average of 1.6 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Incontinence and gait problems were more likely to improve than cognition. Sixteen (53%) of 30 patients achieved a good overall functional outcome, and incontinence was the only feature significantly associated with good outcome (P=.04). Neither cerebrospinal fluid-opening pressure nor tap tests predicted improvement from ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Median duration of improvement was 6 months, and median survival after receiving the shunt was 14.5 months. Shunt-related complications occurred in 10 (33%) of 30 patients, with 1 fatal outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Our results from ventriculoperitoneal shunting in selected patients with radiation-induced hydrocephalus suggest potential benefit. Improvement is incomplete and temporary, but can improve quality of life. Reliable predictors of successful shunt outcome were not identified."
2526,Excluded,"Photobiomodulation Therapy Inhibit the Activation and Secretory of Astrocytes by Altering Macrophage Polarization Spinal cord injury (SCI) stimulates reactive astrogliosis and the infiltration of macrophages, which interact with each other at the injured area. We previously found Photobiomodulation (PBM) significantly decreases the number of M1 macrophages at the injured area of SCI. But the exact nature of the astrocyte response following PBM and relationship with the macrophage have not been explored in detail. In this study, a BALB/c mice model with standardized bilateral spinal cord compression and a macrophage-astrocyte co-culture model were applied to study effects of PBM on astrocytes. Results showed that PBM inhibit the expression of the astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the secretion of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) in the para-epicenter area, decrease the number of M1 macrophage in vivo. The in vitro experiments indicated M1 macrophages promote the cell viability of astrocytes and the expression of CSPG. However, PBM significantly inhibited the expression of GFAP, decreased activation of astrocyte, and downregulated the expression of CSPG by regulating M1 macrophages. These results demonstrate that PBM may regulate the interaction between macrophages and astrocytes after spinal cord injury, which inhibited the formation of glial scar."
1980,Excluded,"A bayesian adaptive randomized phase ii trial of bevacizumab versus bevacizumab plus vorinostat in adults with recurrent glioblastoma final results BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab improves outcome and reduces symptoms in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). However, GBMs develop adaptive resistance to bevacizumab- mediated angiogenesis inhibition resulting in tumor recurrence. We hypothesized that vorinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, with pleotropic antiangiogenic effects, would delay emergence of resistance to bevacizumab therapy and improve clinical outcome. METHOD(S): In this multicenter phase II trial utilizing a novel Bayesian design, patients with recurrent glioblastoma were adaptively randomized to bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab+vorinostat based on a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) such that patients had a higher likelihood of receiving the more efficacious treatment. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and quality of life assessment (MDASI-BT). Eligible patients were adults (>= 18 yrs) with histologically confirmed GBMs recurrent after prior radiation and temozolomide therapy, adequate organ function, KPS>= 60, and no prior bevacizumab/HDAC inhibitors. RESULT(S): Ninety patients (bevacizumab+vorinostat:49, bevacizumab:41) were enrolled and 74 were evaluable for PFS (bevacizumab+vorinostat:44, bevacizumab:30). Grade 3 or greater toxicities in 85 evaluable patients included hypertension (n=37), neurological changes (n=2), anorexia (n=2), infections (n=9), wound dehiscence (n=2), DVT/PE (n=2), and colonic perforation (n=1). There was one treatment-related death due to pulmonary embolism. Upon multivariate analysis for bevacizumab+vorinostat vs bevacizumab, median PFS (3.7 vs. 3.9 months, p=0.94, HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.38, 1.06, p=0.08]) or median OS (7.8 vs. 9.3 months, p=0.64, HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.5, 1.6, p=0.79]) were not significantly different between the two arms. Ongoing analyses of patient reported outcomes (MDASI-BT) and plasma biomarkers will be reported. CONCLUSION(S): Combining bevacizumab with vorinostat did not result in improved PFS or OS compared with bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent GBM. This trial is the first to test a Bayesian PFSbased adaptive randomized design in patients with primary brain tumors and demonstrates the feasibility of using adaptive randomization in a multicenter setting."

Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a provincial linked database of 5718 cardiac patients with thorax and head or neck cancer having undergone radiotherapy between 2000 and 2011. One thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were identified as nonstatin users and 4166 as statin users. The primary outcome of interest was the composite of cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) or cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The crude event rate was 10.31% for nonusers and 9.03% for statin users (hazard ratio of 0.92 [95% CI 0.76-1.10, P=0.3451]), over a mean time to event/censoring of 534+/-687 days for nonusers and 594+/-706 days for the statin users. After adjusting for age, sex, prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and hypertension, statin use postradiotherapy was associated with a nonsignificant 15% relative risk reduction, but a strong trend toward reducing the primary outcome (hazard ratio=0.85 95% CI 0.69-1.04, P=0.0811). The use of statins was associated with a significant reduction of 32% for the outcome of stroke alone (hazard ratio=0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, P=0.0368). Conclusions Statin use post radiation therapy was associated with a significant reduction in stroke, with a trend toward significantly reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events."

Cysts of AE may involve lots of organs like lung, spleen, kidneys, heart, bone and brain and imitate a malign tumor. Method(s): A 31 years old male patient was admitted to our clinic due ataxi and seizures. Neurological examination revealed mildly impaired orientation and mentation, hemiparesis on right extremites and bilateral extensor Babinski sign. We have learned from his medical history he has been diagnosed as metastases of the lung and brain originating from the primary liver malignancy using PET-CT imaging and brain metastases have been treated by radiation theraphy recently. MR examination of brain demonstrated well-defined round hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images and hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images on the parietal, occipital, frontal, temporal and cerebellar regions of the brain. Surrounding oedema and ringshaped contrast enhancement were seen the walls of the cystic lesions. The results of an indirect echinococcal hemagglutination test were positive.

936,Excluded,"Platelet aggregation in acute coronary syndromes: use of a new aggregometer with laser light scattering to assess platelet aggregability OBJECTIVE: Platelet aggregation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. Small aggregates consisting of < or = 100 platelets cannot be quantified with a conventional aggregometer employing optical density. Using a recently developed aggregometer based on laser light scattering, we studied platelet aggregability in patients with acute coronary syndromes.METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 39 patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina who had received no prior antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, to be assayed immediately using a PA-100 platelet aggregometer. Blood samples from 14 healthy volunteers were used as controls.RESULTS: Spontaneous formation of platelet aggregates was observed only in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The size of these aggregates was small, consisting of < or = 100 platelets (primary aggregation). Agonist-induced aggregation consisted of two phases. In the first few minutes, the number of small aggregates increased markedly (primary aggregation), followed by an increase in larger aggregates (secondary aggregation). The EC50 of epinephrine for primary aggregation was nearly 50 times lower in acute coronary patients than in controls (P < 0.001), while the EC50 for secondary aggregation was only 2 times lower (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Aggregometry using light scattering suggests that platelet hyperaggregability and hypersensitivity in acute coronary syndromes may occur in primary but not secondary aggregation."

Median Karnofsky performance scale score was 70. After chemotherapy, 7 patients (41%) had a complete response (CR) and 7 (41%) a partial response (PR). After RT, 13 (76%) patients achieved a CR, 2 (12%) a PR, and 2 (12%) had disease progression. Relapse occurred in 7 (41%) patients; median disease-free survival was 18 months. Fifteen (88%) patients have died: 8 (47%) from PCNSL, 5 (29%) from neurotoxicity, and 2 (12%) from unknown causes. Median overall survival was 32 months. Two patients (12%) are alive and disease free at 12 years follow-up. Nephrotoxicity was a minor complication, but grades 3 and 4 myelosuppression were found in 5 (29%) patients.CONCLUSIONS: This regimen resulted in an efficacy and toxicity profile comparable to other combined modality treatments, despite the relatively low dose of methotrexate. It may be a useful option in patients unable to tolerate higher doses. Procarbazine and thiotepa are potential candidates for incorporation into chemotherapy regimens aiming to decrease the incidence of neurotoxicity.

2595,Excluded,"Differences in the DNA supercoiling response of irradiated cell lines from ataxia-telangiectasia versus unaffected individuals In this study the manifestation of DNA damage at the nucleoid level was examined in several AT cell lines using an image analysis system to directly visualize and measure the changes in DNA loop size which occur when increasing concentrations of propidium iodide (PI) are used to titrate the DNA supercoiling response (the 'fluorescent halo assay'). This response consists of a relaxation (0.5-7.5 micrograms/ml PI) and rewinding phase (10-50 micrograms/ml PI), the latter of which is impaired by the presence of DNA strand breaks in irradiated cells. In addition to the inhibition of DNA rewinding seen immediately after irradiation at 0 degrees C, the supercoiling response of AT diploid fibroblasts indicated an increased amount of DNA unwinding compared to fibroblasts from unaffected individuals. This difference appeared to saturate, since the excess in DNA loop size over that seen in irradiated fibroblasts from unaffected individuals remained constant after 5 Gy. These results may reflect a greater instability of the DNA-nuclear matrix attachment points in irradiated AT fibroblasts. The DNA supercoiling response in irradiated transformed AT fibroblasts and AT lymphoblasts did not differ from that observed in unaffected cells of the same type. However, all of the immortalized cell lines (AT and unaffected) had inherently larger DNA loop sizes than diploid fibroblasts and exhibited excess unwinding after irradiation."

The extensive distribution of soltriol nuclear receptor cells, revealed by autoradiography with tritium-labeled 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D, soltriol) and related effects, indicate an involvement of vitamin D-soltriol in the actinic induction of seasonal biorhythms. This is considered to be independent of the traditionally assigned effects of vitamin D on systemic calcium regulation. Skin-soltriol mediated seasonal, and to a degree daily, genomic activation involves many target regions in the brain. These include neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala, in the linked part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, in periventricular hypothalamic neurons, dorsal raphe nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus and autonomic, endocrine as well as sensory and motor components of the brainstem and spinal cord. Additional to the eye-regulated ""suprachiasmatic clock"", existence of a soltriol-vitamin D regulated neural ""timing circuit(s)"" is proposed. Both, activational and organizational effects of soltriol on mature and developing brain regions, respectively are likely to play a role in the regulation of neuronal functions that include the modulation and entrainment of biorhythms. Soltriol's central effects correlate with peripheral effects on elements in skin, bone, teeth, kidney, intestine, heart and blood vessels, endocrine organs, and tissues of the immune and reproductive system.

2713,Included,"Cerebromicrovascular dysfunction predicts cognitive decline and gait abnormalities in a mouse model of whole brain irradiation-induced accelerated brain senescence Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is a mainstream therapy for patients with both identifiable brain metastases and prophylaxis for microscopic malignancies. However, it also promotes accelerated senescence in healthy tissues and leads to progressive cognitive dysfunction in up to 50% of tumor patients surviving long term after treatment, due to gamma-irradiation-induced cerebromicrovascular injury. Moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) via neuronal activity-dependent cerebromicrovascular dilation (functional hyperemia) has a critical role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. To determine whether cognitive decline induced by WBI associates with impaired cerebromicrovascular function, C56BL/6 mice (3 months) subjected to a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) and control mice were compared. Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker-stimulation-induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post-irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post-irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post-irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for early and persisting neurovascular impairment after a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI, which predict early manifestations of cognitive impairment."
2997,Excluded,"Effects of ion channel blocks on electrical activity of stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neural network under electromagnetic induction The effects of channel blocks on the spontaneous spiking activity and neuron networks pattern selection are investigated by using an improved Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model in which the electromagnetic induction is considered and the magnetic flux is used to describe the influence of electromagnetic field. The discharge behavior of neurons induced by potassium ion and sodium ion channel blocks was analyzed by numerical simulation in the improved HH model. The results suggest that changes in the maximum conductance of potassium channels can cause spontaneous discharge behavior of neurons. The poisoning of potassium ion can be weakened by the electromagnetic radiation in the neural network, and the neural network presents a state of spatial order in the case of spiral waves. It is interesting that the ordered waveform is generated by no-flux boundary condition when the initial states are selected as wedge-shaped type in the network. In addition, potassium channel blocks can promote the discharge of neurons and facilitate the formation of spiral waves in the neural network. By contrast, the electrical activity of neurons is inhibited by sodium channel blocks.

267,Excluded,"Correlation between the light scattering and the mitochondrial content of normal tissues and transplantable rodent tumors The development of noninvasive optical studies necessitates an understanding of the biological parameters which affect light propagation in soft tissues. In the present report, we have measured the optical properties of various normal (i.e., perfused liver, brain, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue) and neoplastic rodent tissues (i.e., glioma, hepatoma, mammary adenocarcinoma) by using time-resolved spectroscopy. The contribution of the hemoglobin (+ myoglobin in the case of muscle) to the total light absorption at 780 nm has been determined. This contribution varies from about 25% (brain, skeletal muscle) to about 100% (white adipose tissue, 13762A mammary adenocarcinoma, 9L glioma). These results are explained by different blood volume fractions in the tissues and by the existence at 780 nm of other chromophores, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Secondly, the dependence of the light scattering of the tissue on both the cell and the mitochondrial content has been analyzed. The results indicate that there is no correlation between the light scattering and the DNA content, measured as an indicator of the cell number in the tissue. The scattering coefficient is proportional to both the succinate dehydrogenase activity and the mitochondrial protein content of the tissue, which are indicators of the mitochondria content of the tissue when based upon estimates of tissue wet weight."

Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal. Irradiated spinal nerve regions showed increased thickness and hypointensity on MR imaging.CONCLUSION: The single-session tolerance dose of the cervical spinal nerves lies between 19.0 and 24.1 Gy for this model."
777,Excluded,"Recurrent non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a review on the new pathological classification, management guidelines and treatment options At least 50% of surgically resected non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) recur. Either early or late adjuvant radiotherapy is highly efficacious in controlling recurrent NFPA but associates potentially burdensome complications like hypopituitarism, vascular complications or secondary neoplasm. Reoperation is indicated in bulky tumor rests compressing the optic pathway. To date, no standardized medical therapy is available for recurrent NFPA although cabergoline and temozolomide show promising results. Guidelines on the management of recurrent NFPAs are now available. The new 2017 WHO pituitary tumor classification, based on immunohistochemistry and transcription factor assessment, identifies a group of aggressive NFPA variants that may benefit from earlier adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, NFPA patients exhibit a reduced overall life expectancy largely due to hypopituitarism and treatment-related morbidity. The management of recurrent NFPA benefits from a multidisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, endocrinologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists and neuro-radiologists in order to provide individualized therapy and anticipate deterioration.

The scope of this study was to determine outcome and to define risk factors. Patients and Methods: 27 patients (53.3 +/- 15.8 y; 16/27 male) with popliteal soft tissue sarcomas were assessed. Mean follow-up was 40.9 +/- 33.8 months (48.5 +/- 36.7 months in surviving patients). 9/27 patients were included after prior treatment elsewhere (5 after intralesional resections and 4 local recurrences). The lesions were staged IB in 8/27 patients, IIB in 17/27 and III in 2/27. Immediate amputations were performed in 7/27 patients. 15/27 patients were subjected to radiation therapy (preoperative in 6/15 cases), 8/27 patients received chemotherapy (5/8 preoperatively). Result(s): Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 y was 63.0% and 59.5%. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. 8/27 patients developed metastatic disease after 28.9 +/- 9.8 months. Survival (p = 0.397) and disease-free survival (p = 0.113) did not differ in patients after amputations vs limb salvage. Application of radiation therapy was associated with a better survival (p = 0.003). Complications related to the surgical intervention were recorded in 2/27 patients, complications related to radiation therapy occurred in 6/15 patients. Discussion(s): Despite being extra-compartmental, popliteal sarcomas can be treated with a high rate of limb salvage while equal safety compared to amputations is maintained. Irradiation improved survival in our patient population. In cases with involvement of neurovascular structures, preoperative down-staging with radio or chemo-therapy may prevent amputation.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is able to modulate pain response to capsaicin. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of DLPFC activation (through rTMS) on nociceptive control in a model of capsaicin-induced pain. The study was performed on healthy subjects that underwent capsaicin application on right or left hand. Subjects judged the pain induced by capsaicin through a 0-100 VAS scale before and after 5 Hz rTMS over left and right DLPFC at 10 or 20 min after capsaicin application in two separate groups (8 subjects each). Left DLPFC-rTMS delivered either at 10 and 20 min after capsaicin application significantly decreased spontaneous pain in both hands. Right DLPFC rTMS showed no significant effect on pain measures. According to these results, stimulation of left DLPFC seems able to exert a bilateral control on pain system, supporting the critical antinociceptive role of such area. This could open new perspectives to non-invasive brain stimulation protocols of alternative target area for pain treatment."
3048,Excluded,"Altered expression of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA in rat brain after photochemically induced focal ischemia BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter glutamate is involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals must be removed rapidly from the synaptic cleft by high affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate transporters to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low to protect neuron from glutamate excitotoxicity, which is the major pathological mechanism of brain ischemia. GLAST is one of the identified four subtypes of the glutamate transporter system and has been suggested to play an important role in some pathological conditions. But until recently, very little information existed the concerning relationship between GLAST expression and cerebral ischemia.METHODS: Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was employed to evaluate the changes of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA expression in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus following photochemically induced focal cortical ischemia.RESULTS: GLAST mRNA expression in cerebral pyramid cells below the infarcted area did not change at 3 h, significantly decreased at 12 h, recovered to the control level at 24 h, and significantly increased at 72 h following the ischemic lesion. No changes in GLAST mRNA expression were observed in all subfields of the hippocampal complex.CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the time-course changes of GLAST mRNA expression after ischemia may be correlated with the pathogenesis of photosensitive ischemic brain damage."
3111,Included,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy Purpose/Objective(s): In our previous study, we have found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis shortly after radiation. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of minocycline on neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis. Purpose/Objective(s): The immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cell line was used. The protective effect of minocycline on X-irradiated HT22 cells was demonstrated using clonogenic assay and apoptosis analysis. The underlying mechanisms were explored by using methods such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, shRNA knockdown, Western blot et al. Result(s): We found that minocycline protected HT22 hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced cell death, manifest as increased clonogenic cell survival and decreased apoptosis in irradiated cells. This protective effect of minocycline might involve cell cycle perturbation after radiation, but not DNA damage and repair. Further investigation showed that X-irradiation activated AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy, and minocycline significantly enhanced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of minocycline might not be involved in the enhancing effect of minocycline on radiation-induced autophagy, but it might at least partially contribute to the inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced apoptosis. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis mainly through targeting radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy."

Method(s): A Monte Carlo (MC) study with the TOPAS tool was performed to compare the accuracy of relative stopping power (RSP) reconstruction and spatial resolution of low-fluence HeCT to pCT, both using 200 MeV/u particles. An ideal setup consisting of a flat beam source and a totally absorbing energy-range detector was implemented to estimate the theoretically best achievable RSP accuracy for the calibration and reconstruction methods currently used for pCT. The phantoms imaged included a cylindrical water phantom with inserts of different materials, sizes, and positions, a Catphan phantom with a module containing high-contrast line pairs (CTP528) and a module with cylindrical inserts of different RSP (CTP404), as well as a voxelized 10-year-old female phantom. Dose to the cylindrical water phantom was also calculated. The RSP accuracy was studied for all phantoms except the CTP528 module. The latter was used for the estimation of the spatial resolution, evaluated as the modulation transfer function (MTF) at 10%. Result(s): An overall error under 0.5% was achieved for HeCT for the water phantoms with the different inserts, in all cases better than that for pCT, in some cases by a factor 3. The inserts in the CTP404 module were reconstructed with an average RSP accuracy of 0.3% for HeCT and 0.2% for pCT. Anatomic structures (brain, bones, air cavities, etc.) in the digitized head phantom were well recognizable and no artifacts were visible with both HeCT and pCT. The three main tissue materials (soft tissue, brain, and cranium) were well identifiable in the reconstructed RSP-volume distribution with both imaging modalities. Using 360 projection angles, the spatial resolution was 4 lp/cm for HeCT and 3 lp/cm for pCT. Generally, spatial resolution increased with the number of projection angles and was always higher for HeCT than for pCT for the same number of projections. When HeCT and pCT scan were performed to deliver the same dose in the phantom, the resolution for HeCT was higher than pCT. Conclusion(s): MC simulations were used to compare HeCT and pCT image reconstruction. HeCT images had similar or better RSP accuracy and higher spatial resolution compared to pCT.

693,Excluded,"Depleted and natural uranium: chemistry and toxicological effects Depleted uranium (DU) is a by-product from the chemical enrichment of naturally occurring uranium. Natural uranium is comprised of three radioactive isotopes: (238)U, (235)U, and (234)U. This enrichment process reduces the radioactivity of DU to roughly 30% of that of natural uranium. Nonmilitary uses of DU include counterweights in airplanes, shields against radiation in medical radiotherapy units and transport of radioactive isotopes. DU has also been used during wartime in heavy tank armor, armor-piercing bullets, and missiles, due to its desirable chemical properties coupled with its decreased radioactivity. DU weapons are used unreservedly by the armed forces. Chemically and toxicologically, DU behaves similarly to natural uranium metal. Although the effects of DU on human health are not easily discerned, they may be produced by both its chemical and radiological properties. DU can be toxic to many bodily systems, as presented in this review. Most importantly, normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, and heart can be affected by DU exposure. Numerous other systems can also be affected by DU exposure, and these are also reviewed. Despite the prevalence of DU usage in many applications, limited data exist regarding the toxicological consequences on human health. This review focuses on the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological effects of depleted and natural uranium on several systems in the mammalian body.

This ""benign"" condition can cause significant neurologic morbidity both from the disease and unnecessary surgical treatment of the disease. Although rare, generally intracranial RDD has been treated with chemotherapy or radiation with limited role for surgery to relieve mass effect. Surgical approaches to the skull base are invasive and pose risk, especially for a benign and self-limiting disease like RDD. Presented, is the case of a 63-year-old woman with a presumed spheno-cavernous meningioma that was previously radiated without tissue diagnosis. In the interim, she was diagnosed with RDD by her dermatologist after skin biopsy. Upon presentation, the patient was experiencing retroorbital headaches and blurry vision, and MR imaging demonstrated progression of her lesion. On examination she had mild right proptosis and a partial Cranial Nerve III palsy. For these reasons, surgical biopsy was undertaken with the goal of orbital and optic nerve decompressions. An endoscopic endonasal unilateral approach was performed to sample tissue at the superior orbital fissure, with bony decompression of the orbit and optic canal. Her symptoms stabilized and the diagnosis was made of skull base RDD, after which she was started on steroids and methotrexate. At 1-month follow-up the patient remained well. Her proptosis improved, Cranial Nerve III symptoms remained stable, and her RDD remained stable as well. Hematology will start this patient on Cladribine for more intensive systemic therapy.

The main pathological feature of AD is the deposition of misfolded beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) plaques in the brain. The abnormal accumulation of Abeta plaques leads to the loss of some neuron functions, further causing the neuron entanglement and the corresponding functional damage, which has a great impact on memory and cognitive functions. Hence, studying the accumulation mechanism of Abeta in the brain and its effect on other tissues is of great significance for the early diagnosis of AD. The current clinical studies of Abeta accumulation mainly rely on medical imaging techniques, which have some deficiencies in sensitivity and specificity. Optical imaging has recently become a research hotspot in the medical field and clinical applications, manifesting noninvasiveness, high sensitivity, absence of ionizing radiation, high contrast, and spatial resolution. Moreover, it is now emerging as a promising tool for the diagnosis and study of Abeta buildup. This review focuses on the application of the optical imaging technique for the determination of Abeta plaques in AD research.

726,Excluded,"Brain Radiation Induced Extracranial Abscopal Effects in Metastatic Melanoma Historically, the brain has been viewed as a specialized neurovascular inert organ with a distinctive immune privilege. Therefore, radiation-induced extracranial abscopal effects would be considered an unusual phenomenon due to the difficulty of the immunogenic signaling molecules to travel across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, it is now possible that localized central nervous system radiation has the ability to disrupt the structural integrity of the BBB and increase its endothelial permeability allowing the free passage of immunogenic responses between the intracranial and extracranial compartments. Thus, the nascent tumor-associated antigens produced by localized brain radiation can travel across the BBB into the rest of the body to modulate the immune system and induce extracranial abscopal effects. In clinical practice, localized brain radiation therapy-induced extracranial abscopal effects are a rarely seen phenomenon in metastatic melanoma and other advanced cancers. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of the current state of knowledge and clinical experience of central nervous system radiation-induced extracranial abscopal effects in patients with malignant melanoma. Emerging data from a small number of case reports and cohort studies of various malignancies has significantly altered our earlier understanding of this process by revealing that the brain is neither isolated nor passive in its interactions with the body's immune system. In addition, these studies provide clinical evidence that the brain is capable of interacting actively with the extracranial peripheral immune system. Thus, localized radiation treatment to 1 or more locations of brain metastases can induce extracranial abscopal responses. Collectively, these findings clearly demonstrate that localized brain radiation therapy-induced abscopal effects traverses the BBB and trigger tumor regression in the nonirradiated extracranial locations."
2295,Excluded,"Changes in olfactory inputs modify the energy balance response to short days in male gray mouse lemurs The role of olfaction/olfactory cues on photoperiodic responses was assessed in Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur. When exposed to short photoperiod (SP), this primate demonstrates rapid changes in energy balance as adaptive anticipatory response for winter survival. To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls. These results suggest that olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy balance."

Additionally, cannabis use and alcohol use are each associated with WM abnormalities, however there is limited data on these substances effects on WM microstructure in psychosis, especially early phase psychosis (EPP). This study examined the impact of cannabis use and alcohol use in WM in EPP (N=21) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transverse relaxation time of tissue water (T2), with the primary outcomes being mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2. Method(s): Analyses were performed at the full brain level using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis as well as within a predefined WM region of interest (ROI) implicated in psychosis (containing the left superior longitudinal fasciculus). Result(s): Our findings revealed that younger age of onset of regular alcohol use (greater than one drink per week) was associated with lower FA values in the left thalamic radiation, left parahippocampal and left amygdalar WM. Also, more frequent lifetime cannabis use was correlated with increased mean full brain FA, although this finding did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. There was no significant relationship found between FA and alcohol or cannabis use within the ROI. Relaxometry analysis revealed trend level evidence of shortened T2 with more frequent cannabis use. Conclusion(s): This study provides novel data demonstrating cortical and subcortical WM changes related to alcohol use in EPP and is the first to combine DTI and relaxometry as it relates to this patient population."

In addition, in vivo experiments with human xenografts and human clinical trials with pancreas cancer demonstrated that high plasma concentrations of ascorbate (~20 mM) are well tolerated. Since ascorbate crosses the blood brain barrier, we hypothesized that high dose ascorbate would enhance chemo-radio-sensitization in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials/Methods: In order to determine if high dose ascorbate enhances GBM chemo-radio-sensitization, U87 and UI-581 human GBM cells were grown in vitro for 24 hrs and then exposed to 0.5 mM ascorbate and/or temozolomide 100 mmol/L for 1 hr followed by 2 Gy of concurrent irradiation. In the xenograft studies, U87 GBM cells were grown in the flanks of nude mice and treated with ascorbate (4 mg/kg; IP), and/or ionizing radiation (6 Gy x 2 fractions 48hrs apart) for 2 weeks. Tumor growth rates were assessed daily with calipers. Result(s): Both U87 and UI 581 cell lines demonstrated that ascorbate has an additive effect on radiation+temozolomide-induced cell killing in clonogenic cell survival analysis (p<0.05). In addition, ascorbate toxicity was completely inhibited (p<0.05) with the addition of catalase confirming that ascorbate toxicity is mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Mice with U87 GBM xenograft tumors treated with ascorbate and radiation demonstrated a significantly slower tumor growth rate compared to mice receiving radiation alone (p=0.031). Median survival in mice treated with radiation alone was 21 days while mice treated with ascorbate plus radiation was 28 days (p = 0.034). Conclusion(s): These experiments support the hypothesis that high dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM."

Cells within the same tumor display distinct phenotypes that affect their growth rate, survival, migration, therapy-response, and tumor-propagating capacity. We now understand cancer stem cells (CSCs) play critical roles in driving intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity by establishing dynamic cellular transitions within tumors. GBM are highly aggressive tumors that display a poorly differentiated cell phenotype characterized by high expression of genes enriched in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Lineage-tracing experiments show that stem-like cells are responsible for GBM re-growth after therapy and this process is in part mediated by known drivers of stemness (e.g. Sox2). There is a strong correlation between the expression of stem cell drivers and markers and tumor recurrence in multiple cancers, including GBM. We and others have established that reprogramming transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2 are important drivers of the stem-cell, tumor and therapy-resistant phenotype in GBM. We present data showing that GBM cells expressing transgenic Oct4 and Sox2 are more resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) treatment and exposing GBM neurospheres to temozolomide (TMZ) and IR gives rise to a cell sub-set with higher gene expression levels of Oct4 and Sox2 compared to untreated cells. The clinical and potential therapeutic relevance of this phenotype is supported by multi-dimensional transcriptome analyses that identifies a group of genes induced by Oct4 and Sox2 enriched in recurrent GBM. The promiscuous quality of miRNAs is an underexploited characteristic that could allow the targeting of multiple parallel oncogenic pathways using a single agent, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing chances of tumor recurrence. To explore this untapped potential, we predicted miRNAs likely to target the transcripts induced by Oct4/Sox2 in recurrent GBM and identified miR-149-3p as a high-priority candidate. Importantly, transient expression of miR-149-3p simultaneously repressed these transcripts in GSCs as measured by qRT-PCR, concurrent with a decrease in the capacity of both parental and GSCs expressing transgenic Oct4/Sox2 to self-renew as spheres, a biomarker of cell stemness and tumor-propagating potential. Additionally, transient expression of miR-149-3p also re-sensitized therapy-resistant GBM neurospheres to TMZ treatment. These results show this resistant phenotype is reversible and support our hypothesis that GSC-driving mechanisms induce a subset of genes that give rise to therapy-resistant GBM cells and suggests that miR-149-3p can be developed as a therapeutic for recurrent GBM."

We evaluated our experience with radiosurgical and microsurgical treatment alone and in combination for the management of NVCNS.METHODS: The charts of 62 patients with NVCNS who were treated between 1993 and 2005 at our institution were reviewed. Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results. When treatment with either modality alone is not reasonable, tumors can be managed effectively with combined micro- and radiosurgery treatment."

The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) early after injury of the optic nerve of rhesus monkeys by a single-dose/fractionation-scheme of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intraorbital optic nerve contour of 5 rhesus monkeys was acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then, the unilateral intraorbital optic nerves of 5 rhesus monkeys were injured by gamma knife surgery (GKS) with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve). DTI was performed before the irradiation and 1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 24weeks after injury to obtain the cross-sectional area, and the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values.RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the injured optic nerve exhibited significant atrophy 24weeks after SRS. FA declined 1week after injury; this value then increased slightly but remained lower than before injury (P<0.05). AD began to decline in the 2weeks after injury and gradually disappeared (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: SRS with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve) on the unilateral intraorbital optic nerve can induce RION. DTI can detect RION at an early stage. FA and AD are useful indicators for RION diagnosis. In the early stage, the primary site of RION may be the vascular endothelium."
969,Excluded,"Light seeing in radiotherapy of patients with brain tumours and head and neck malignancies Purpose or Objective: Evaluating the radiation doses delivered to different parts of the visual pathway for better understanding of light vision in radiotherapy patients. Material(s) and Method(s): 20 patients with brain tumors and head and neck malignancies who received radiotherapy and experienced any kind of light or color vision during radiation treatment. All the components of visual pathway including lenses, eyeballs, retinas, optic nerves, chiasm, optic tracts, optic radiations and visual occipital cortexes were contoured. Result(s): 11 patients were male (55%) and 9 were female (45%). Age median was 56 years. The range of dose/fraction and total prescribed dose were 1.8-3 Gy and 36-70.4 Gy respectively. Twelve patients reported white, 11, blue, 2, yellow and 2, gray color visions. Seven patients experienced more than one color, while 2 patients did not attribute any special color to their light seeing experiences. Four patients had a kind of smell experience and 1 patient had a taste experience. Conclusion(s): Cherenkov radiation in eye ballsmay be the origin of light seeing experiences in patients receiving radiation treatment for head and neck malignancies, since treatmentsareperformed with ionizing radiations with energycapable to produce this effect. Also this effectmay be due to phosphenes produced by radiation treatment in different parts of the visual pathway (from retina to visual cortex). In order to investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon in patients and to define a radiation dose threshold - if the origin of this phenomenon is phosphenes produced in visual pathway - larger studies are needed."
669,Excluded,"Long-term angiographic and clinical outcome after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and intracoronary radiation therapy in humans BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation has been shown to reduce neointimal formation after balloon angioplasty in experimental models of restenosis. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for preventing restenosis in human coronary arteries.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 arteries) with unstable angina underwent standard balloon angioplasty. ICRT was performed with the use of an 192Ir source wire that was hand delivered to the angioplasty site. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 24 hours, between 30 and 60 days, and at 6 months. Angioplasty was successful in 19 of 22 lesions, and insertion of the radioactive source wire was successful at all treated sites. Angiographic study at 24 hours demonstrated early late loss of the luminal diameter from 1.92+/-0.55 to 1.40+/-0.27 mm. Between 30 and 60 days, repeat angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 2 arteries, a new pseudoaneurysm in 1 artery, and significant dilatation at the treatment site in 2 additional vessels. At > or = 6 months' follow-up, all remaining arteries (n=20) maintained patent, with a mean lumen diameter of 1.65+/-0.8 mm. The calculated late lumen loss was 0.27+/-0.56 mm, and the late loss index was 0.19. Clinical events at 1 year included myocardial infarction in 1 patient, repeat angioplasty to the treated site in 3 patients, and persistent angina in 7 patients.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate that ICRT after coronary intervention is feasible and is associated with an acceptable degree of complications and lower rates of angiographic restenosis indexes."
1380,Excluded,"Hepatic iron loading and oxidative stress in ataxia-telangiectasia mice Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in a myriad of abnormalities including progressive neurodegeneration, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to ionising radiation. At a cellular level A-T is a disease of chronic oxidative stress (OS) resulting from reduced antioxidant defence capacity leading to the oxidative damage of proteins, lipids, and DNA. Transition metals such as Fe<sup>2/+</sup> act as pro-oxidative molecules, catalysing the conversion of weakly reactive oxygen species such as H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, causing significant oxidative damage. Cellular iron accumulation and the resultant OS has also been linked to the neurodegeneration seen in Alzheimer0s and Parkinson's diseases, lymphoid tumours (which occur in approximately 30% of A-T patients), and ionising radiation hypersensitivity. To investigate iron regulation in A-T, iron indices, iron regulatory gene expression, and markers of oxidative stress were studied in livers of wild-type and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) null mice on a control diet and when challenged with a high iron diet. At 10 weeks of age, Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a control diet had increased serum iron, hepatic iron and ferritin, with significantly up-regulated hepcidin (Hamp1) expression compared to wild-type mice. When challenged with the high iron diet Bone morphogenetic protein 6, Hfe, and Ferroportin were all significantly up-regulated in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> compared to wild-type mice. Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice also had significantly higher hepatic OS that increased disproportionately in animals fed the high iron diet. In summary, we have demonstrated that Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a propensity to accumulate iron in spite of the appropriate regulation of genes involved in iron homeostasis. The increased hepatic iron in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice is associated with a disproportionately large increase in hepatic OS. Our results suggest that increased iron status may contribute to the chronic OS seen in A-T patients."

Current guidelines recommend 5-hydroxytryptamine<inf>3</inf> receptor antagonists (5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs) for prophylaxis of RINV for moderate and highly emetogenic radiotherapy; however, certain patients may suffer from RINV despite prophylaxis. Objective(s): To determine if switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs is successful in the treatment and further prophylaxis of RINV. Method(s): This report details the case of a 47-year-old female with extensive bony involvement to the spine from breast cancer presenting with lower back pain. To palliate her symptoms, the patient underwent a course of irradiation to the lumbar spine and was prescribed ondansetron as an antiemetic. However, the patient experienced severe nausea and emesis and was subsequently switched to granisetron and aprepitant. Result(s): The patient completed the remainder of the radiation treatment with no further emesis and minimal nausea, representing the first documented success of granisetron and aprepitant for RINV after failure on ondansetron. Conclusion(s): In chemotherapy, switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs after failure on the first is successful in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), yet this has not been previously observed in radiation. In this patient, granisetron and aprepitant were successful in substantially reducing nausea and preventing further emesis, and may represent an alternative antiemetic regimen for RINV prophylaxis and salvage.

Clinically significant radiation necrosis (RN) was defined as symptomatic RN or asymptomatic RN that resulted in surgery or bevacizumab administration. The cumulative incidence was calculated using competing risks. Risk factors were identified using Cox proportional hazards.RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 28.5 months, cRN developed in 18 patients (proton, 6; photon, 12). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN for proton and photon therapy was 18.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5%-33.8%) and 9.7% (95% CI, 5.1%-16%), respectively (P = .16). On multivariate analysis, risk factors for cRN included oligodendroglioma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.57; 95% CI, 1.38-9.25; P = .009) and higher prescription dose (in gray relative biological equivalents [GyRBE]) (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61; P = .015). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas was 24.2% and 6.2%, respectively (P = .01). The relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was a significant dosimetric predictor of cRN in oligodendrogliomas (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that 1p/19q codeleted oligodendroglioma was a significant risk factor associated with cRN and the relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was an important dosimetric predictor of cRN for oligodendroglioma patients. There is insufficient evidence at this time to conclude a significant difference in the incidence of cRN between proton and photon therapy."

These areas were identified individually prior to rTMS using fMRI in a subgroup of our patients. Active stimulation was applied over Broca's area and over the superior temporal gyrus as determined by fMRI, or according to structural images in the remaining patients. rTMS did not lead to a significant reduction of hallucination severity.

The control group sustained a one-minute clip compression (force of clip was 30 g) injury of the spinal cord at the T2 level, without X-irradiation. The experimental group received X-irradiation 14 days after injury. Neurological function was assessed by the modified Tarlov method, including hind limbs movement, inclined plane, and pain withdrawal. These tests were performed in a blinded fashion at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after injury. At 43 days after injury, histological examination of the injured spinal cord was performed following decapitation of the rats.RESULTS: Sixty-two rats met the experimental requirements (spinal cord injury was similar), 32 rats in experimental group and 30 rats in control group. Statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in hind limbs movement and inclined plane (P < 0.01), but not in the pain withdrawal test. The edema and necrosis areas of injured spinal cords in experimental group were less than those in control group, and axons in experimental group were significantly more than those in control group (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Delayed X-irradiation following spinal cord injury may enhance functional recovery by improving and restoring structural integrity of the injured spinal cord in rats."

Even if uncertainties in risk assessment will be reduced in the next few years, there is little doubt that appropriate countermeasures have to be taken to reduce the exposure or the biological damage produced by cosmic radiation. In addition, it is necessary to provide effective countermeasures against solar particle events, which can produce acute effects, even life threatening, for inadequately protected crews. Strategies that may prove to be effective in reducing exposure, or the effects of the irradiation, include shielding, administration of drugs or dietary supplements to reduce the radiation effects, crew selection based on a screening of individual radiation sensitivity.

The effects of linopiridine on local cerebral glucose metabolism were studied by the quantitative autoradiographic 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose method. Linopirdine administration in naive rats (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) did not significantly alter cerebral glucose metabolism in any of the regions analyzed. Since linopirdine protects against hypoxia-induced passive avoidance deficits in rats, we also examined the effects of linopirdine on cerebral metabolism after the rats were exposed to 30 min of hypoxia. Glucose metabolism was not significantly altered after hypoxic exposure, except for a small increase in some brain regions. Linopirdine administered after hypoxia decreased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus, limbic cortex, ventral hippocampal commissure, medial septum, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta, lateral habenula, cerebral cortex, cerebellar vermis and a few thalamic nuclei. Statistically significant effects of linopirdine on glucose metabolism were observed in 22 of 56 brain regions sampled. In hypoxia-exposed rats, linopirdine altered glucose metabolism in brain regions that are implicated in learning and memory and are affected in Alzheimer's disease. Several of the affected regions are associated with the cholinergic system and may play a role in the cognitive enhancing properties of linopirdine."

We have previously reported that CRT-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain tissues and inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus might be caused by microglial activation and may play an important role in RIBI. In this study we examined the role of p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD) in radiation-induced activation of BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotide control mRNA or antisense oligonucleotide-targeted PIDD mRNA and were sham or 16 Gy irradiated. The state of microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Findings from this study suggest that silencing PIDD expression could inhibit microglial activation by downregulating the PIDD-C/NF-kappabeta transcription pathway. PIDD acts as a critical switcher between the NF-kappabeta transcription pathway and radiation-induced apoptosis. Given these findings, this study offers a potential novel approach to further combination treatment of RIBI."

In these two structures we evaluated spike amplitude, area, duration, rise time and mean total firing rate. The recording spike density was higher in the STN than in the SNr (94% vs. 28%). Microelectrode recordings showed a larger spike area and amplitude in the SNr than in the STN ([mean+/-SD] amplitude: 46.7+/-31.1 vs. 36.3+/-29.6 microV; area: 25.6+/-24.2 vs. 36.7+/-21.4 microVmsec), a higher total firing rate at rest in the SNr than in the STN (78.6+/-53.5 vs. 61.9+/-40.8 Hz), and a longer duration and rise time in the SNr than in the STN (duration: 2.0+/-1 vs. 1.3+/-0.6 ms; rise time: 0.95+/-0.6 vs. 0.67+/-0.3 ms). Our analysis also revealed sex-related differences in the studied spike descriptors, paralleling recent findings from deep electroencephalography recordings. In the STN, males had larger spike area and amplitude (amplitude: 41.97+/-32.57 vs. 26.2+/-19.7 microV; area: 31.8+/-26.4 vs. 13.0+/-10.6 microVmsec), whereas females had higher mean total firing rate (66.7+/-53.4 vs. 82.8+/-50.8 Hz).

312,Excluded,"Refresher course: Ultrasound guided chronic pain management: Evidence and practice Ultrasound has become a popular tool utilized in the performance of chronic pain interventions. Traditionally, procedures in pain medicine were performed using anatomic landmarks, fluoroscopy or CT scan. While the semodalities continue to be utilized, there has been a tremendous growth in the use of ultrasound by pain practitioners. Interventional techniques for acute and chronic pain management have traditionally performed upon a combination of anatomical landmarks, electron eurostimulation or imaging. All this techniques are usefull but, ENS has no help in avoiding puncture of vessels, pleura or other structure. Fluoroscopy is effective for visualization of bony structures but not soft tissues. It thus has limitations when performing procedures for peripheral procedures. While CT scan is better than fluoroscopy for visualization of bony structures and soft tissue, it can be cost prohibitive and is associated with significant radiation exposure to the patient and practitioner Most pain management guidelines have moved towards recommending image guidance such as ultrasound, fluoroscopy or CT scan for interventional procedures. This is largely due to the increased accuracy, reliability (precision) and safety associated with structure visualization. Ultrasound can identify other structures asmuscles, ligaments, vessels, joint and bony surfaces. An ultrasound machine is affordable, portable and does not diffuse radiation, its use has not be associated with any risk both for patients and practitioners. The image that we can see is real time and can be performed continuously along the procedure Ultrasound can be implemented in office-based practice for diagnostic and therapeutic injections. Mergin experience from various specialities seems to be a way for forward. Musculoskeletal US experts (radiologists, rheumatologists) may help to develop skills in joint injections. Trigger point injections (including Botulinum Toxin A) are not longer to be blind but specific group of muscle can be targeted and potential complications (pneumothorax, intraperitoneal, intravaascular injections) avoided. Anesthetists with experience with peripheral nerve blocks under ultrasound guidance naturally progress to blocks in field of chronic pain. Chronic pain procedures may include nerve blocks, many spinal approches, including epidurals, selective nerve block, facet joints, medial branch blocks and sympathetic blocks. More recently ultrasound guidance has been used as aid placement of peripheral neuromodulation electrodes. What limitations. High frequency probe providing high resolution pictures but will not penetrate deep tissue. Low frequency probe penetrates deeper but quality of pictures is degradeed. Structures like bones are not easily penetrated by ultrasound wave producing scattering or artifacts. Spine procedures: The primary advantage of ultrasonography (besides no radiation exposure) is direct visualization of soft tissue structures, it is particularly beneficial in cervical spine injections, where the multitude of blood vessels and other vital soft tissue structures make this area particularly vulnerable to injury if only fluoroscopy-guided injections are used. Ultrasound is an excellent tool in ""visualizing"" and, hence, ""avoiding"" vascular injury during cervical spine procedures, whereas contrast fluoroscopy can only ""detect"" when the tip of the needle is intravascular. One should be mindful that fluoroscopy may not detect that the needle has already traversed a vessel on its way to the target, whereas ultrasound can avoid this. Ultrasound guided lumbar intra-articular and medial branch block was compared to the most commonly used fluoroscopically guided approach. Very good result were obtained with US technique but limitations also exist when compared to fluoroscopically based technique. These limitiations are: obese patients, chllenge in detecting intravascular injection at such a depth, the possible need for a larger-gauge needle to improve visibility[1]. Thus despite the increasing number of paper published no recomandations can be given at this time if US is superior to fluoroscopy. On the contrary third occipital nerve block under fluoroscopy has a false positive rate of 38% and accurate needle placement up to 82% has been achieved with US guidance[2]. Also US guided stellate ganglion block helps in decreasing complications. With the anatomical landmarks trechnique several side effects or complications can occur. Puncture of the oesophagus leading to mediastinitis or carotid artery or other thyroids vessels puncture are serous complications. US guidance increases the incidence of successful sympathetic block and lowers the incidence of hoarseness associated with local anesthetic injections above the prevertebral fascia.[3] US guidance is very helpfull in border nerve syndromes (genitofemoral, iliinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves) where anatomical landmarks are confusing. Anatomical variability of the course of this nerves and distributiona of the sensory innervated skin area are very high. US helps in needle visualisation and makes anatomy more predictable.[4] In trunk pain US helps to visualise ribs, pleura, muscle layers. US makes the block easier and safer. In other sitution as pudendal neuralgia diagnosis is primarily a clinical one, confirmed by a diagnostic block. Tha interligamentous plane is the key to local anesthetic placement. US helps in real time visualisation of needle placement and confirmation of an injectate sperad within the interlegamentous plane. Almost 100% block success has been achieved by this technique and by identifyng pudendal artery and depositing local anesthetic solution media to the artery[5] US was considered a standard tool also for musculoskeletal pain. All joint injection can better performed under US guidance.[6] Ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve stimulation avoids the invasiveness of electrode placement via an open procedure while providing excellent pain relief. There are limitations of the percutaneous approach when navigating close to large blood vessels, a situation more appropriately managed with open peripheral nerve stimulator placement. Ultrasound-guided placement may be considered for patients receiving peripheral nerve stimulators placed within the deep tissues, and not easily placed in a blind fashion.[7] Conclusion(s): US systems are more available and cheap these days. Transportable devices give high resolution and quality pictures. This device is available in almost every hospital. Potential advantages of ultrasound are: no hazard of radiation exposure, it could be done in every position, visualization of nerves and surrounding structures: vessels, muscles, bone and visceral pleura, lung, peritoneum, bowel, diagnostic recognizing anatomical variability and pathology real time image of needle, needle nerve contact and inject it spread, reduce complication: nerve injury, vessels puncture, pneumothorax etc., higher success rate, quicker onset, reduces performance time, reduce volume of local anesthetic. A problem with the application of ultrasound in chronic pain interventions is that randomised controlled trials may not be ethical while comparing to fluoroscopy or CT. Wide world use of ultrasound guidance into clinical practice has to come as its use a tool, from clinical outcome studies. Its further development will depends on training and education. ASRA and ESRA published recomandation on this issue in 2009[8] Further investigations will include quantitative analysis of bidimensional ultrasound images, coupled with volume data from 3D ultrasound technology."

Diagnosis of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) was established in accordance with diagnostic standards adopted inUkraine. All study subjects had no signs of CVD, and neither of endocrine disease nor of metabolic disorders beforethe accident.RESULTS: Clinical course of the TIIDM, depending on the disease severity, onset of angiopathy and polyneuropathy,prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure were surveyed and analyzed. Concomitant TIIDM was associated witha higher incidence of angina pectoris and heart failure. According to the Kaplan-Meier method of survival estimatingthe accumulation of new TIIDM cases occurred faster in the ACUW compared with individuals in the CG, however withno statistical significance in subjects aged up to 60 years old (log-rank test chi2 = 4.89, p = 0.027). Mean age of theACUW having comorbid CVD and DM was (54.6 +/- 9.7) years, whilst in the CG it was (59.9 +/- 10.7) years (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: The DM course in the ACUW was not significantly different from non-irradiated control both in sever-ity and such complications as angiopathy of retina and lower extremities, as well as manifestations of lower extrem-ity polyneuropathy. Clinical manifestations of CVD in the form of angina pectoris and heart failure were identical inthe ACUW and control group of patients having a comorbid TIIDM. The latter was a factor exacerbating the CVDcourse and leading to a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure both in the ACUW and in non-irritat-ed individuals. Accumulation of the new DM cases occurred more rapidly in ACUW vs. non-irradiated control, so theywere in average 5 years younger at the time of TIIDM manifestation than the control subjects."

Open surgery is invasive and carries a risk of neurological injury and vertebral column dysfunction. Conventional radiotherapy often has poor clinical efficacy and a risk of neurologic complications. Spinal radiosurgery has been developed to overcome these limitations. This technique consists of precise delivery of high-dose radiation to a spinal target. To spare the delicate and radiation-sensitive spinal cord and to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications, it is essential that the radiation dose decreases rapidly outside of the target. This is accomplished by use of advanced, image-guidance technology, treatment planning software, and robotics. Preliminary data indicate that this approach can achieve high rates of tumor control of spinal and paraspinal lesions and durable reduction of associated vertebral pain without neurological complications.

Impact on working habits of the physician was quantified using fluoroscopy time and number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images.RESULTS: The optimized system settings provided significant reduction in dose indicators versus reference system settings (p<0.001): from 124 to 47 Gy cm(2) and from 0.78 to 0.27 Gy for neuroangiography, and from 328 to 109 Gy cm(2) and from 2.71 to 0.89 Gy for interventional neuroradiology. Differences were not significant between the two systems with regard to fluoroscopy time or number of DSA images.CONCLUSION: X-ray imaging technology using an image noise reduction algorithm and system settings provided approximately 60% radiation dose reduction in neuroangiography and interventional neuroradiology, without affecting the working habits of the physician."
1518,Excluded,"Inactivation and block of calcium channels by photo-released Ca2+ in dorsal root ganglion neurons Calcium channels are inactivated by voltage and intracellular calcium. To study the kinetics and the mechanism of calcium-induced inactivation of calcium channels, a ""caged"" calcium compound, dimethoxy-nitrophen was used to photo-release about 50 microM calcium ion within 0.2 millisecond in dorsal root ganglion neurons. When divalent cations were the charge carriers, intracellular photo-release of calcium inactivated the calcium channel with an invariant rate [time constant (tau) approximately equal to 7 milliseconds]. When the monovalent cation sodium was the charge carrier, photorelease of calcium inside or outside of the cell blocked the channel rapidly (tau approximately equal to 0.4 millisecond), but the block was greater from the external side. Thus the kinetics of calcium-induced calcium channel inactivation depends on the valency of the permeant cation. The data imply that calcium channels exist in either of two conformational states, the calcium- and sodium-permeant forms, or, alternatively, calcium-induced inactivation occurs at a site closely associated with the internal permeating site."
1179,Excluded,"Neck stiffness in a post-irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma adult: An unusual diagnosis Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a neoplasm commonly found in population of South East Asia. The mainstay of treatment is high dose irradiation. Complications from radiotherapy are not uncommon especially to those nearby structures such as vertebrae and spinal cord. A 57 year-old gentleman with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who was treated with chemo-radiation (total of 35 fractions,70Gy) presented to us 6 months post therapy with bilateral nasal discharge and progressive neck stiffness. Nasoendoscopy showed inflamed nasophayngeal mucosa and Computed Tomography (CT) brain and cervical spine showed retropharyngeal and anterior epidural collection with extension into atlantoaxial bone and spinal cord compression. Histopathological specimen revealed features of chronic inflammations with multiple actinomycetes colonies. Our patient suffered severe neck stiffness and loss of sensations on both upper limbs. He was treated conservatively with Halo vest and intravenous antibiotics for 8 weeks and recovered fully. Irradiation in NPC is known to cause devastating complications to cervical spine such as osteoradionecrosis, osteomyelitis. It also renders tissues hypoxic and risk of getting rare infection like actinomycosis. This report can represent a great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with differentials of tumor recurrence, osteoradionecrosis or osteomyelitis. Patients must be regularly followed up to look for possible cervical complications as a result from irradiation, to prevent devastating outcome or prognosis."
1055,Included,"Utility of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Modern Era with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance Aims: To retrospectively analyse the impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on survival and intracranial progression in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) in the modern era of widespread magnetic resonance imaging brain screening. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with LS-SCLC treated within our network between 2009 and 2020 who responded to initial therapy were stratified by receipt of PCI and stage of disease. A propensity score match analysis was carried out for stage II-III patients. Overall and neurological survival were defined as time to death and presumed death due to uncontrolled intracranial disease, respectively. Brain metastasis-free survival and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival were defined as freedom from intracranial progression and symptomatic intracranial progression, respectively. The effect of PCI on these outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Result(s): In total, 243 (69.6%) of 349 patients received PCI. On multivariate analysis in the propensity matched stage II-III cohort, PCI was a significant predictor of improved neurological survival (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.65; P = 0.01), brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51; P < 0.01) and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55; P < 0.01), but not improved overall survival. Two-year neurological survival estimates within the propensity matched cohort were 96.8% (95% confidence interval 87.6-99.2%) with PCI and 77.2% (95% confidence interval 63.0-86.4%) without PCI and 1- and 2-year estimates of incidence of brain metastases were 3.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7%) and 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6-23.5%) in the PCI group and 31.6% (95% confidence interval 22.1-43.9%) and 40.4% (95% confidence interval 29.2-54.0%) in the no PCI group, respectively. Conclusion(s): In the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging screening, PCI was associated with reduced incidence of intracranial progression in patients with stage II-III LS-SCLC who respond to initial therapy. This, importantly, translated to a decreased risk of neurological death within our propensity matched cohort, without significant improvement in overall survival.

2436,Excluded,"Surface chemistry governs cellular tropism of nanoparticles in the brain Nanoparticles are of long-standing interest for the treatment of neurological diseases such as glioblastoma. Most past work focused on methods to introduce nanoparticles into the brain, suggesting that reaching the brain interstitium will be sufficient to ensure therapeutic efficacy. However, optimized nanoparticle design for drug delivery to the central nervous system is limited by our understanding of their cellular deposition in the brain. Here, we investigated the cellular fate of poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles presenting different surface chemistries, after administration by convection-enhanced delivery. We demonstrate that nanoparticles with 'stealth' properties mostly avoid internalization by all cell types, but internalization can be enhanced by functionalization with bio-adhesive end-groups. We also show that association rates measured in cultured cells predict the extent of internalization of nanoparticles in cell populations. Finally, evaluating therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic model of glioblastoma highlights the need to balance significant uptake without inducing adverse toxicity."
1335,Excluded,"Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish Larval zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating the mechanisms involved in generating rhythmic patterns of behavior, such as swimming, due to the array of techniques available including genetics, optical imaging, and conventional electrophysiology. Because electrophysiological and imaging studies of rhythmic motor behaviors in paralyzed preparations depend on the ability to monitor the central motor pattern, we developed a fictive preparation in which the activity of axial motor neurons was monitored using extracellular recordings from peripheral nerves. We examined spontaneous and light induced fictive motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish (4-6 days post-fertilization) paralyzed with curare. All spontaneous and light-induced preparations produced alternation of motor activity from side-to-side (mean contralateral phase = 50.7 +/- 7.0%; mean burst frequency = 35.6 +/- 4.7 Hz) and a progression of activity from head-to-tail (mean ipsilateral rostrocaudal delay = 0.8 +/- 0.5 ms per segment), consistent with lateral undulation and forward propulsion during swimming, respectively. The basic properties of the motor pattern were similar in spontaneous and light-induced swimming. This fictive preparation can be used in combination with conventional electrophysiological and imaging methods to investigate normal circuit function as well as to elucidate functional deficits in mutant lines. Toward this end, we show that two accordion class mutants, accordion and bandoneon, have alternating activity on opposite sides of the body, contradicting the hypothesis that their deficit results from the absence of the reciprocal glycinergic inhibition that is typically found in the spinal cord of swimming vertebrates."

Neurocognitive testing utilized the Morris Water Maze with a Noldus Etho Vision video tracking system. Testing was completed pre treatment and then 8 weeks after treatment at which time the animals were then sacrificed. Mice were trained with 3 trials/day ( 90 second maximum ) with a 30 minute intra-trial interval for 5 consecutive days. At sacrifice amyloid count , volume , synaptophysin along with other stains were completed Results: Latency period for controls pre treatment were 58 secs ( SD +/- 23s ) and 48 secs (SD +/- 15s ) for 'to be treated' animals ( p=.39 ). At 8 weeks post treatment the control animals latency period was 60 secs ( SD +/- 15s) and for the treated animals it was 31secs(SD+/- 17s) (p=0.03 ) The treatment group located the platform significantly faster than the control animals on the final day of testing. This finding was not attributed to baseline learning the groups did not differ in latency to find the platform pre treatment Treatment animals had statistically lower amyloid plaque numbers and trended towards significance in volume of residual plaques Conclusion(s): This data confirms our previous hemi brain irradiation data but documents improved memory performance when LDWBI is utilized. Based on this data we have been granted FDA approval to initiate a Ph I human clinical trial using LDWBI."

RF exposure for 24 h at a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 10 W/kg was carried out in a waveguide system under accurately controlled environmental and dosimetric parameters. DNA integrity, cell viability, and apoptosis were investigated as cellular endpoints relevant for carcinogenesis and other diseases of the central nervous system. Very sensitive biological assays were employed to assess the effects immediately after RF exposure and 24 h later, as demonstrated by the cellular response elicited in PC12 cells using positive control treatments provided for each assay. In our experimental conditions, 24 h of RF exposure at a carrier frequency and modulation scheme typical of a UMTS signal was not able to elicit any effect in the selected cellular endpoints in undifferentiated PC12 cells, despite the application of a higher SAR value than those applied in the majority of the studies reported in the literature."

After an i.v. injection of a small amount of radioactive probe, PET images are taken based on the decay of shortlived positron-emitting isotopes. The emitted positron collides with a neighboring electron to produce two 511 KeV gamma rays roughly 180 apart. It is based on this physical principal and the positron coincident signals that the point source of the gamma rays can be deduced by using a coincident circuit for detectors 180 apart. Currently, there are three FDA-approved imaging agents (Amyvid, NeuraCeq, and Vizamyl) available for mapping Abeta in the brain of patients suspected of having Alzheimer's disease. There is a strong interest in measuring tau deposition by PET imaging in a quantitative manner.

2101,Included,"A model for assessing cognitive impairment after fractionated whole-brain irradiation in nonhuman primates To investigate the effect of fractionated whole-brain irradiation on nonhuman primates, 6-9-year-old male rhesus monkeys were irradiated with 40 Gy delivered as two 5-Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed 5 days/week for 4 months prior to fractionated whole-brain irradiation and for 11 months after irradiation using a Delayed-Match-to-Sample (DMS) task at both low and high cognitive loads. Local rates of cerebral glucose metabolism were measured prior to and 9 months after irradiation using [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography. Low cognitive load trials did not reveal a significant reduction in performance until 7 months after irradiation; performance then declined progressively. In high cognitive load trials, the initial impairment was observed ~1 month after irradiation. This was followed by a transient recovery period over the next 1-2 months, after which performance declined progressively through 11 months after irradiation. Nine months after irradiation, glucose uptake during the DMS task was decreased in the cuneate and prefrontal cortex and was increased in the cerebellum and thalamus compared with the levels prior to irradiation. Results from this pilot study suggest that the radiation-induced changes in cognition and brain metabolism observed in rhesus monkeys may be similar to those observed in brain tumor patients receiving brain irradiation."
698,Included,"Distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells in X-irradiated rats. An electrophysiological study 1. The distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied with intracellular recordings in X-irradiated and normal rats. 2. In the treated rats, multiple steps in the post-synaptic potential were elicited in 57% of the Purkinje cells by graded stimulation of the climbing fibres, the response was all-or-none in character in the other cells and in all Purkinje cells recorded in normal animals. In the neurones exhibiting the former type of response, no collision was seen along the afferent fibres during interaction experiments between just-threshold juxtafastigial and maximal olivary stimulations, whereas a collision always occurred when all-or-none responses were recorded. 3. These results show that in X-irradiated rats, the majority of Purkinje cells have a multiple innervation by two to four climbing fibres, instead of the one-to-one relationship seen normally. 4. Input resistances and total electrotonic lengths of Purkinje cells were measured in normal and treated rats. Mean values for these two parameters were higher than normal in multiply innervated cells. 5. Mean time course and mean current for reversal of the post-synaptic potential elicited in Purkinje cells by stimulation of the climbing fibres were nearly the same in mono- and in multiply innervated neurones. In multiply innervated cells, time courses and currents for reversal were independent of the size of the response or varied slightly with it, suggesting that the climbing fibres involved innervated territories whose electrotonic distance from the recording site were either the same or slightly different. 6. Interactions between two all-or-none steps of the graded post-synaptic potential evoked in multiply innervated cells by juxtafastigial and olivary stimulations revealed either a very weak or a very marked shunting effect between synapses of the two climbing fibres involved. 7. These results indicate that the over-all distribution of climbing fibre synapses on multiply innervated Purkinje cells is not grossly abnormal and that two fibres contacting a given cell can be either intermingled on the same dendrites, or segregated on distinct dendritic branches. 8. In general, the present study does not suggest the existence of a strong competition among climbing fibres innervating each Purkinje cell during development at least when granule cells are absent."

Straylight values were measured before surgery and 3 months after surgery using the Oculus C-Quant (Oculus Optikgerate). Furthermore, correlations were analyzed between straylight and the following parameters: keratometry, axial length, spherical equivalent, astigmatism, pIOL power, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, and pupil size.RESULTS: Mean straylight decreased from 1.18 +/- 0.17 log units before surgery to 1.13 +/- 0.17 after surgery (P = .016). Higher preoperative straylight values were associated with larger postoperative decreases in straylight (r = -0.534; P < .001). Higher postoperative straylight values were correlated to higher axial length (r = 0.444; P = .001) and lower keratometry values in diopters (r = -0.414; P = .001). After regression analysis, only axial length was found to be an independent predictor of preoperative and postoperative straylight (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). After correcting for the axial length of an emmetropic eye (23.44 mm), all straylight correlations disappeared, indicating that an increase in distance from cornea to retina explains the increase in straylight values in longer eyes.CONCLUSIONS: Retinal straylight was reduced significantly after Artiflex pIOL implantation. Besides age, axial length was the only predictor of preoperative and postoperative straylight values. The increased tissue length light has to pass from cornea to retina, might explain the increase in straylight values in longer eyes."

[Japanese] Radiation-induced brain injury is a life-threatening or at least QOL-compromising pathological entity induced by therapeutic irradiation to malignant brain tumors. Although life-threatening late delayed radiation necrosis and radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy had been assumed to be major complications of radiation therapy to the brain classically, these complications seem to be less frequently seen in therapeutic irradiation to the brain recently because in many treatment protocols to brain tumors, irradiation field is now confined to tumors and their margins and adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of methothrexate etc. has been avoided as much as possible. Instead, less aggressive but still QOL-compromising encephalopathy has been recognized for the past 20 years. This encephalopathy occurs in senior adults several months after the extended field irradiation with even less amount of irradiation dose such as 40 Gy whole brain irradiation. This encephalopathy is characterized by cognitive impairment and brain atrophy which attenuates QOL of the patients.

2946,Excluded,"Developing optic radiation tractography to reduce visual field deficits following anterior temporal lobe resection Objectives: Anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is an effective treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Damage to Meyer's loop of the optic radiation (OR) leads to postop visual field deficits (VFD) in 52-100% of patients and may prevent driving. The OR cannot be seen on clinical MRI sequences, but can be visualised using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Incorporating these data into the neuronavigational system during surgery should reduce the risk of VFD. However, preop tractography is no longer valid due to brain shift/distortion. A new image registration technique to compensate for brain shift/distortion is described and validated it in a cohort of patients undergoing ATLR with the aim of using this to guide future neurosurgery. Method(s): Pre-/postop structural MRI and DTI scans were acquired on 16 patients undergoing ATLR. The OR was delinetaed using probabilistic tractography on preop data and propagated onto postop structural images using a novel image registration technique. Degree of resection was quantified by the maximum A-P distance between the anterior of the OR on the propagated tractography and the resection margin. Postop VFD was quantified as percentage of upper quadrant lost using Goldmann perimetry. Result(s): Postop VFD were seen in 8 patients (10-92% of the upper quadrant, mean 51%). In 8 patients without VFD, the propagated OR was 0.0-15.0 (mean 3.4 mm) posterior to the resection margin. In 8 patients with VFD, the propagated OR lay 3.8-15.9 (mean 7.7 mm) anterior to the resection margin. The Pearson correlation coefficient between A-P distance and VFD was 0.809 (one-tailed p = 0.008). Linear regression showed for each additional 1 mm of resection, 5.8% more upper quadrant vision was lost. Mean image registration time by implementation on a GPU (graphical processing unit) was 3.2 min. Conclusion(s): A novel non-linear registration algorithm was used to propagate preop OR tractography onto postop images. Results obtained were highly predictive of the VFD. MRI and DTI scans can be acquired during surgery in an interventional MRI suite. As transfer of the patient from the MRI scanner back to the operating table takes 7-10 min, the algorithm is fast enough to be applied to propagate preop tractography onto intraop images before surgery recommences. Future work will display the propagated tractography to the surgeon in the neuronavigation system to determine whether this additional information can reduce the risk of a VFD."

All patients had treatment and follow-up data available in their medical charts, which we extracted for this retrospective study. We evaluated a number of potential predictors of survival after WBRT: age, primary tumor stage, control of primary tumor, presence of other systemic metastases, site of systemic metastases, Karnofsky performance status, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis class, total dose of WBRT, and number of BM. Eighteen patients received a total dose >3000 cGy and 7 received a partial brain boost.RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the median survival from the start of WBRT was 4.2 months. The 1-year survival rate was 17%, and the 2-year survival rate was 2%. Using univariate analysis, only Karnofsky performance status (p = 0. 0084), recursive partitioning analysis class (p = 0. 0147), and total WBRT dose (p = 0.0001) were predictive of longer survival.

2472,Excluded,"Therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells can result from deregulated EGFR signaling The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with various downstream molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/GSK-3, Jak/STAT and others. Often these pathways are deregulated in human malignancies such as breast cancer. Various therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of EGFR family members including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been developed. A common problem with cancer treatments is the development of drug-resistance. We examined the effects of a conditionally-activated EGFR (v-Erb-B:ER) on the resistance of breast cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil as well as ionizing radiation (IR). v-Erb-B is similar to the EGFR-variant EGFRvIII, which is expressed in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate. Both v-Erb-B and EGFRvIII encode the EGFR kinase domain but lack key components present in the extracellular domain of EGFR which normally regulate its activity and ligand-dependence. The v-Erb-B oncogene was ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) which results in regulation of the activity of the v-Erb-ER construct by addition of either estrogen (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) to the culture media. Introduction of the v-Erb-B:ER construct into the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line increased the resistance to the cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs, hormonal-based therapeutics and IR. These results point to the important effects that aberrant expression of EGFR kinase domain can have on therapeutic resistance."

Objective(s): This study was to establish an ideal radioactive optic nerve injury animal model. Method(s): Healthy 8-week SD rats with hygiene grade were randomly divided into normal control group and model group, with 6 rats in each group. The total 30 Gy dose of radiation with 3 portions was used to irradiate the head model group rats; ELISA was performed to analysis the changes of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations in blood 2, 4 and 8 weeks after irradiation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscope were performed to observe the changes of optic structure.

There were significant differences of ET-1 and vWF concentrations among different groups and time points (ET-1: F<inf>group</inf>=32.160, P=0.012 ; F<inf>time</inf>=21.180, P=0.023.vWF: F<inf>group</inf>=73.110, P=0.001; F<inf>time</inf>=46.180, P=0.002). The nerve fiber bundles was swelled with disordered arrangement and vacuolization 8 weeks after irradiation. Axon swell and atrophy, axons with myelin sheath layer plate separation were obtained. The rates of axon demyelination in the normal control group and model group were (1.35 +/- 0.79)% and (14.44 +/- 2.32)%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=14.07, P<0.01).

957,Excluded,"Celecoxib combined with hippocampus sparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy reduces the injury of cognitive function induced by radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Objective: In this study, we compared the effects of combination of celecoxib, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and hippocampal sparing, IMRT with hippocampal sparing and IMRT only on cognitive function, life quality and therapeutic effects in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): From June 2015 to December 2016, 177 cases with NPC in our hospital were finally enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: IMRT only group (I group), hippocampal sparing IMRT (H group) and celecoxib combined with hippocampal sparing IMRT group (Ce group). Cognitive function and life quality were evaluated three months after treatment via Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ C30) respectively. Indicators for therapeutic effects including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), adverse reactions, recurrence and metastasis of tumor and serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of patients were also compared. Result(s): Before the intervention, there was no difference in cognitive function score among all the patients (P=0.876). After the treatment, no significant difference was found for RR among groups (P=0.245), however, patients in the Ce group showed the highest cognitive function score (P<0.001); the differences in adverse reactions including dry mouth (P=0.026, Ce vs. H; P=0.000, Ce vs. I; P=0.000, H vs. I), oral mucositis (P=0.060, Ce vs. H; P=0.008, Ce vs. I; P=0.396, H vs. I), skin reaction (P=0.654, Ce vs. H; P=0.027, Ce vs. I; P=0.065, H vs. I), irradiation otitis media (P=0.097, Ce vs. H; P=0.009, Ce vs. I; P=0.051, H vs. I) had statistical significance, and their incidence rates in Ce group were lowest. Meanwhile, recurrence and metastasis were less in the Ce group although the differences were insignificant (P=0.302 and 0.638). The serum level of CEA was notably lower in Ce group (P=0.031, Ce vs. H; P=0.020, Ce vs. I; P=0.512, H vs. I). Life quality scores about cognitive function and role function of H group and Ce group were higher than that of I group while Ce group was the highest (Cognitive function: P=0.020, Ce vs. H; P=0.015, Ce vs. I and P=0.023, H vs. I; role function: P=0.039, Ce vs. H; P=0.011, Ce vs. I and P=0.031, H vs. I). Conclusion(s): Celecoxib combined with hippocampus sparing IMRT for the treatment of NPC patients could drastically alleviate cognitive dysfunction, improve life quality and reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with hippocampal sparing IMRT and IMRT only.

2902,Included,"Neuroprotective effect of liu wei di huang tang on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice OBJECTIVE To explore the effect and mechanisms of LW-AFC, a new formula derived from Liu Wei Di Huang Tang, on irradiation-induced reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n=10): control group, LW-AFC group (1.6 g?kg<sup>-1</sup>), Liu Wei Di Huang Tang (LW) group (10 g-kg<sup>-1</sup>), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) group, irradiation group, irradiation+ LW group, and irradiation + LW-AFC group. Reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis was induced by cranial irradiation. LW-AFC was administered by oral gavage for 30 d after cranial irradiation treatment. Immunofluorescence and Nissl's staining were performed for histological morphology assessment. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was used in the detection of proliferation cells. The peripheral blood and hippocampal homogenate were collected to measure the content of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-y), interleukin-1 (3 (IL-1(3), IL-4 and IL-10. The hippocampal homogenate was used for Western blot to detect the BDNFkappaB signal pathway, including extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and BDNF target protein. Morris water maze and new object recognition test were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. The mice forced swimming and tail suspension test were used to assess alteration in depressive behavior. Long term potentiation was used to examine the synaptic plasticity change of mice. RESULTS Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced after irradiation of 20 Gray dose (10 Gray per day, total 2 d). LW-AFC treatment increased the BrdU number of irradiated mice (P<0.05). In Morris water maze test, LW-AFC group showed decreased escape latency in the learning period (P<0.05), while increased the number of crossing the platform in the memory period. LW-AFC can also reduce the immobility time of mice in the tail suspension test (P<0.01). CONCLUSION LW-AFC modulates adult neurogenesis to ameliorate cognitive impairment and reduce depressive behavior in radiation injury mice."

The exposure took place in cylindrical coil at laboratory temperature. After the experiment they were sacrificed and the level of protein c-Jun and c-Fos in different parts of brain were estimated. The expression of c-Fos was not affected by magnetic field on the other hand the expression of c-Jun decreased after magnetic field exposure. The results did not depend on sex of mice."
822,Included,"Selenium content and distribution in rat tissues irradiated with gamma rays The effects of supplementation with selenous yeast and ionizing radiation on selenium (Se) content and distribution were evaluated in rat tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, heart, muscle, blood, front brain, hind brain, hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal glands, testes, and hair). This study had 16 Se-supplemented (0.5 micrograms Se/d) and 16 placebo adult male Wistar rats. One half of the animals (eight Se-supplemented and eight placebos) were irradiated with a single dose of 4.2 Gy from a Co-60 source and sacrificed 7 d after irradiation along with nonirradiated animals and analyzed for Se content determination. The data obtained showed that selenous yeast supplementation increased Se levels in rat tissues (highest increases in hypothalamus, 161%; hind brain, 126%; spleen, 110%; and adrenal gland, 105%). Ionizing radiation induced significant changes in Se content and distribution (decrease in liver, blood, hair, femoral muscle, spleen, and hypothalamus; increase in kidney, testes, adrenal glands, and brain of placebo group). Supplementation with selenous yeast reduces changes in Se content and distribution after irradiation. It seems that the animal tissue susceptibility to oxidative damage may be correlated to their ability to retain Se in tissues."
1252,Included,"Physiological and pathological observations on rat middle cerebral arteries and human AVM tissue cultures following single high-dose gamma irradiation In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall."
855,Excluded,"Whole-brain changes in white matter microstructure after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a diffusion tensor imaging study Radiation-induced local white matter (WM) damage has been observed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) within a priori-defined regions of interest following radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we aimed to detect WM changes throughout the brain of NPC patients by DTI. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to analyze DTI data from 81 NPC patients. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were quantified across the whole brain in separate groups: pre-RT, and <6, 6-12, and >12 months post-RT. We found that fractional anisotropy values were significantly lower in the right frontal, parietal, and occipital WM <6 months post-RT compared with pre-RT and remained significantly lower in the right frontal and parietal WM at >12 months. MD values were significantly higher in the right occipital, bilateral temporal, right occipital-temporal junction, left parietal, left centrum semiovale, and left frontal-parietal junction WM <6 months post-RT and remained higher in the right occipital WM at >12 months. This study suggests that changes in white matter microstructure following RT for NPC were widespread, complex, and dynamic. Diffusion tensor imaging with TBSS analysis allows for early non-invasive detection of RT-induced WM damage."
1578,Excluded,"Radiation-induced cerebral aneurysm successfully treated with endovascular coil embolization In a 30-year-old male, multiple cerebral aneurysms developed 19 years after receiving 60 Gy of irradiation for craniophariginoma. Angiogram revealed right IC-PC and upper basilar trunk aneurysms in addition to atherosclerotic change. The right IC-PC aneurysm was wrapped and the basilar trunk aneurysm located between the origins of SCA and AICA was treated by endovascular coil embolization. The packing of the aneurysm was complete, but stenosis of the basilar artery appeared. The patient was discharged uneventfully and follow-up angiogram 6 months later demonstrated that the aneurysm had disappeared and the patency of the basilary artery had been preserved. Radiation-induced intracranial vasculopathy is a well-recognized phenomenon, but aneurysm formation is less common than arterial occlusive lesion. However, the mortality rate after bleeding is so high that immediate diagnosis and treatment by direct surgery or coil embolization are necessary."
816,Excluded,"Hemorrhage of cerebral arteriovenous malformations significantly alters stereotactic radiosurgery outcomes Introduction: Intracranial hemorrhage is simultaneously the most frequent and most debilitating manifestation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM), but its impact on success and complications of radiosurgery has not been rigorously assessed. In this case-control study, we define the effect of prior hemorrhage on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. Method(s): From a prospective, institutional database of 1400 AVM patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, unruptured and ruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to outcome, based on patient demographics, prior embolization, AVM size (mean volume of unruptured AVMs 3.7 cm3 versus ruptured AVMs 3.5 cm3, P=0.195), Spetzler-Martin grade and radiosurgical treatment parameters (mean prescription dose for unruptured AVMs 20.9 Gy versus ruptured AVMs 21.0 Gy, P=0.837). There were 270 patients in each cohort. Matched statistical analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics, obliteration rates, post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage risks, and incidences of radiation-induced changes (RIC) between the two cohorts. Result(s): The actuarial obliteration rates of the two cohorts were similar (unruptured AVMs: 38%, 58%, 76% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 40%, 60%, 73% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.592). However, for embolized AVMs, complete obliteration was more likely to be achieved in unruptured lesions (unruptured AVMs: 25%, 32%, 54% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 18%, 27%, 42% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.038). Prior AVM rupture resulted in a higher annual risk of post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage (ruptured AVMs 2.3% versus unruptured AVMs 1.1%, P=0.025) but a lower rate of cumulative and symptomatic RIC (cumulative RIC: ruptured AVMs 30.4% versus unruptured AVMs 48.9%, P<0.0001; symptomatic RIC: ruptured AVMs 7.0% versus unruptured AVMs 12.2%, P=0.041, respectively). The rates of permanent RIC were similar between the unruptured (2.2%) and ruptured (1.9%) AVM cohorts (P=0.761). Conclusion(s): Prior AVM rupture significantly alters the risk of latency period hemorrhage and RIC following radiosurgery. These effects should be taken into consideration with the multidisciplinary management of AVM patients."

A. calamus extract (250 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to mice 1 h prior to whole body gamma-radiation exposure. The antioxidant levels in the tissue homogenates of brain, liver and kidney of the irradiated mice were determined and cellular DNA damage was monitored by comet assay. Effect of administration of the extract on survival of the animals exposed to acute lethal dose of 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiations was also monitored. Administration of the extract significantly increased the activities of major enzymes of the antioxidant defense system specially SOD, catalase and GPx and levels of GSH in 2, 6 and 10 Gy irradiated mice and decreased the formation MDA. The extract also decreased DNA strand breaks. The survival rate was found to be increased up to 5%. These studies highlight the role of A. calamus extract as good source of natural radioprotecting agent and its therapeutic implications for radiation-induced injuries."
759,Excluded,"Temozolomide induced c-Myc-mediated apoptosis via Akt signalling in MGMT expressing glioblastoma cells PURPOSE: We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of Temozolomide (TMZ) in both O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase (MGMT) depleted as well as undepleted glioblastoma cell lines. Since TMZ is used in clinics in combination with radiotherapy, we also studied the effects of TMZ in combination with ionising radiation (IR).METHODS: Cell colony-forming ability was measured using a clonogenic assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were evaluated by Flow Cytometry (FCM). Proteins involved in cell cycle control were detected by Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assays.RESULTS: Our data showed that TMZ, independent of MGMT expression, inhibited glioblastoma cell growth via an irreversible G(2) block in MGMT depleted cells or the induction of apoptosis in MGMT normal expressing cells. When TMZ was administered in combination with IR, apoptosis was greater than observed with either agent separately. This TMZ-induced apoptosis in the MGMT expressing cells occurred through Akt/Glycogen-Synthase-Kinase-3s (GSK3s) signalling and was mediated by Myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) oncoprotein. Indeed, TMZ phosphorylated/activated Akt led to phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK3s which resulted in the stabilisation of c-Myc protein and subsequent modulation of the c-Myc target genes involved in the apoptotic processes.CONCLUSION: C-Myc expression could be considered a good indicator of TMZ effectiveness."

2715,Included,"Edaravone protects ovaries from radiation-induced apoptosis Objective: Ovaries are very sensitive and prone to radiation-related damage. Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Edaravone is a potent free radical scavenger, which has been clinically used to treat the neuronal damage following acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose is to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone and to investigate the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in rat ovaries after radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups. 1: control group, 2: sham group (only radiation), 3: 450 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group, 4: 45 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed. Histologic changes under light microscopy and immunoreactivity for anticaspase-3 were noted and compared between the four groups. Result(s): There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts, vascular congestion, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and interstitial cell degeneration between the groups. Radiation causes deterioration of histopathological parameters. Administration of edaravone at different doses seems to reverse these alterations and alleviate the injury. Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be enhanced by edaravone. Conclusion(s): This is the first study evaluating the protective effects of edaravone on radiation-induced ovarian damage. Edaravone decreased the follicule apoptosis and attenuates ovarian damage induced radiation in rats."

The purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of palliative gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in a group of poor-risk patients with multiple brain metastases. Methods. The medical records of 72 patients with multiple brain metastases treated with GKS between October 1993 and November 9, 2001, were reviewed retrospectively. All patients presented with more than 10 lesions. There were 26 men and 46 women. The median age was 60 years (range 24-84 years). There were 39 patients with lung cancer, 18 with breast cancer, nine with metastatic melanomas, two with metastatic renal cell carcinomas, and four with other primary tumors. A total of 147 treatment sessions were required to treat 1304 sites in 72 patients. A mean of 10.4 isocenters per treatment was used. The mean tumor volume was 1.7 cm<sup>3</sup>. All patients had extracranial disease. The variables included in this study were the patient's Karnofsky Performance Scale score, age, sex, the radiation dose, initial number of lesions, and tumor volume and histopathology. Conclusions. Radiosurgery can be a powerful tool in the palliative management of advanced metastatic disease even in patients presenting with multiple brain metastases. A median of two outpatient treatments was required, allowing the advanced cancer patient to avoid protracted fractionated radiotherapy and to undergo other therapeutic treatment with an acceptable quality of life."
300,Excluded,"Characterization of the inflammatory response to solid cancer metastases in the human brain BACKGROUND: New immunomodulatroy agents, like ipilimumab, showed promising activity in brain metastases (BM). However, little is known about the inflammatory response in BM and new insights are needed to further guide the development of treatment strategies. METHOD(S): We investigated 17 human autoptic tissue specimens of BM from breast cancer (n = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 5), small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n = 3) and melanoma (n = 6). Immunohistochemical staining for a comprehensive panel of 21 inflammation-associated markers was performed. Results were quantified by manual counting of the various cell populations in three areas of 0.5 mm2 (intratumoral, peritumoral, control region). RESULT(S): Profound microglia activation with marked peritumoral accumulation and some intratumoral infiltration of HLA-DR-positive microglia/macrophages was found. A high proportion of these cells showed strong immunoreactivity for phagocytosis associated markers and MHC class 1, while a smaller subgroup of cells expressed molecules involved in radical production (inducible nitric oxide synthase or NADPH oxidases). Only few B- and T-lymphocytes were observed in and around BM. The number of CD8-positive T-cells was not correlated to MHC class 1 expression on microglia/macrophages or tumor cells. Melanoma BM had significantly less dense peritumoral microglia infiltrates than NSCLC BM. The inflammatory pattern was independent from treatment of patients with glucocorticoids or radiation. CONCLUSION(S): Inflammatory reaction to BM is mainly characterized by activation of microglia/macrophages and shows pronounced upregulation of markers involved in phagocytosis, but seems to be insufficient in activating T-cell response. Treatment strategies aimed at activating specific immunity may potentiate immune attack on tumor cells."
459,Excluded,"CEST signal at 2ppm (CEST@2ppm) from Z-spectral fitting correlates with creatine distribution in brain tumor In general, multiple components such as water direct saturation, magnetization transfer (MT), chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and aliphatic nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) contribute to the Z-spectrum. The conventional CEST quantification method based on asymmetrical analysis may lead to quantification errors due to the semi-solid MT asymmetry and the aliphatic NOE located on a single side of the Z-spectrum. Fitting individual contributors to the Z-spectrum may improve the quantification of each component. In this study, we aim to characterize the multiple exchangeable components from an intracranial tumor model using a simplified Z-spectral fitting method. In this method, the Z-spectrum acquired at low saturation RF amplitude (50 Hz) was modeled as the summation of five Lorentzian functions that correspond to NOE, MT effect, bulk water, amide proton transfer (APT) effect and a CEST peak located at +2 ppm, called CEST@2ppm. With the pixel-wise fitting, the regional variations of these five components in the brain tumor and the normal brain tissue were quantified and summarized. Increased APT effect, decreased NOE and reduced CEST@2ppm were observed in the brain tumor compared with the normal brain tissue. Additionally, CEST@2ppm decreased with tumor progression. CEST@2ppm was found to correlate with the creatine concentration quantified with proton MRS. Based on the correlation curve, the creatine contribution to CEST@2ppm was quantified. The CEST@2ppm signal could be a novel imaging surrogate for in vivo creatine, the important bioenergetics marker. Given its noninvasive nature, this CEST MRI method may have broad applications in cancer bioenergetics."

The mean latency times for the development of myelopathy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam-alone, or in combination with BPA or BSH, were 23.7 +/- 0.3, 21.8 +/- 0.4 and 19.6 +/- 0.4 weeks, respectively. The radiation-induced lesion in the spinal cord was characterised by white matter necrosis. Due to the variations in the microdistribution of different neutron capture agents in body tissues, it was considered inappropriate to define the biological effectiveness of the high LET radiation, resulting from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,alpha)<sup>7</sup>Li neutron capture reaction, relative to photon radiation, using the term 'relative biological effectiveness' (RBE). The term 'compound biological effectiveness' (CBE) factor was used as an alternative. ED<inf>50</inf> values for the various irradiation modalities were calculated from probit fitted dose effect curves. Expressed as total physical absorbed doses these values were 13.6 +/- 0.4, 30.3 +/- 2.7 and 13.8 +/- 0.5 Gy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam alone, or the thermal neutron beam in combination with BSH or BPA, respectively. The RBE of the thermal neutron beam was 1.4 +/- 0.04. The microdistribution of the two neutron capture agents played a crucial role in the determination of the overall biological effect, after thermal neutron activation. BSH, which is excluded from the CNS parenchyma by the blood brain barrier, had a low CBE factor value of 0.46 +/- 0.5. BPA, on the other hand, which crosses the blood brain barrier and distributes in the CNS parenchyma, had a higher CBE factor value of 1.33 +/- 0.16."

1854,Excluded,"[Orthostatic hypotension after space flight] Cardiovascular changes occur during spaceflight. Because of the loss of hydrostatic pressure there is, during weightlessness, a fluid shift of extra- and intra-vascular volumes to the upper part of the body. This provokes objective and subjective symptoms, especially in the first days of spaceflight. The fluid shift is perceived by baroreceptors as a relative central hypervolaemia and induces neuro-hormonal mechanisms which provoke a real hypovolaemia. Cardiovascular deconditioning exists during spaceflight with the following symptoms when astronauts return to earth: decreased orthostatic tolerance with possible tendency towards spontaneous syncope and decreased effort capacity. The mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance are not well known. Several factors are probably involved, including hypovolaemia, modifications of the venous system, baroreflex changes, etc. Various countermeasures have been tested in microgravity simulations on the ground, then in flight.

1976,Included,"Radiation arteritis: a contraindication to carotid stenting? BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) for high-risk anatomic lesions is accepted practice. Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis."
460,Included,"Metallothionein induction in human CNS in vitro: neuroprotection from ionizing radiation PURPOSE: There have been extensive studies on the regulation of metallothionein (MT) synthesis, and its biological role in liver and kidney. Although there are few reports on brain MT, there is a growing interest in the role of MT in brain. There have been no publications to date on MT synthesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) following exposure to ionizing radiation. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures were used to examine the effect of ionizing radiation on MT mRNA and protein synthesis. In the same cultures, the neuroprotective effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd)-induced MT synthesis from high-dose radiation were also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary, serum-free, human CNS cultures were exposed to 30 or 60 Gy gamma-rays. The total MT protein was then measured by a Cd-heme assay, and mRNA for MT-II and MT-III was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release and apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis. Sublethal neuroglial injury was assessed morphologically using specific astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein--GFAP) and neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2--MAP2) immunohistochemical markers.RESULTS: The total MT protein content was increased 12h after exposure to 30Gy. The increase in MT content in response to 60Gy was not statistically significant. MT-II mRNA levels increased at 3 and 6h after exposure to 30Gy gamma-rays, with a maximum expression at 12-24 h. MT-III mRNA was not significantly affected. Exposure to 60 Gy, but not 30 Gy, caused a marked increase in LDH release. Cells exposed to 30 Gy or less showed some apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis, while exposure to 60 Gy resulted in a DNA smear confirmed by LDH assays. Preinduction of MT by 5 microM Cd or 100 microM Zn resulted in a significant reduction in radiation-induced LDH release. Morphological evaluations revealed that Cd or Zn preincubation led to relative preservation of MAP2 staining and GFAP.CONCLUSION: Both MT protein and MT-II mRNA can be induced in human CNS cells by ionizing radiation. Furthermore, induction of MT synthesis with Zn and Cd can protect human CNS cells from radiation-induced cytocidal and sublethal injuries. Both findings have implications in the development of strategies to protect human CNS tissue from damage during radiotherapy."

Cancer survivors were also compared on the basis of treatment intervention, involving chemotherapy (n = 27) versus local therapy through surgery and radiation (n = 30).RESULTS: As a group, the breast cancer survivors scored lower on measures of general cognitive function, working memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function when compared with the normal comparisons. Among the cancer survivors, those who received local therapy scored lower than the other survivors and normal comparisons on measures of verbal learning, visual perception and construction, as well as visual attention and short-term retention.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cognitive outcomes may involve greater age-related deficits among older cancer survivors compared with matched healthy subjects."

In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis."
2691,Excluded,"Biologically effective dose and prediction of obliteration of unruptured arteriovenous malformations treated by upfront Gamma Knife radiosurgery: A series of 149 consecutive cases OBJECTIVE Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present no pathologic tissue, and radiation dose is confined in a clear targeted volume. The authors retrospectively evaluated the role of the biologically effective dose (BED) after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for brain AVMs. METHODS A total of 149 consecutive cases of unruptured AVMs treated by upfront GKRS in Lille University Hospital, France, were included. The mean length of follow-up was 52.9 months (median 48, range 12-154 months). The primary outcome was obliteration, and the secondary outcome was complication appearance. The marginal dose was 24 Gy in a vast majority of cases (n = 115, 77.2%; range 18-25 Gy). The mean BED was 220.1 Gy<inf>2.47</inf> (median 229.9, range 106.7-246.8 Gy<inf>2.47</inf>). The mean beam-on time was 32.3 minutes (median 30.8, range 9-138.7 minutes). In the present series, the mean radiation dose rate was 2.259 Gy/min (median 2.176, range 1.313-3.665 Gy/min). The Virginia score was 0 in 29 (19.5%), 1 in 61 (40.9%), 2 in 41 (27.5%), 3 in 18 (12.1%), and 4 in 0 (0%) patients, respectively. The mean Pollock-Flickinger score was 1.11 (median 1.52, range 0.4-2.9). Univariate (for obliteration and complication appearance) and multivariate (for obliteration only) analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 104 AVMs (69.8%) were obliterated at the last follow-up. The strongest predictor for obliteration was BED (p = 0.03). A radiosurgical obliteration score is proposed, derived from a fitted multivariable model: (0.018 x BED) + (1.58 x V12) + (-0.013689 x beam-on time) + (0.021 x age) - 4.38. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7438; after internal validation using bootstrap methods, it was 0.7088. No statistically significant relationship between radiation dose rate and obliteration was found (p = 0.29). Twenty-eight (18.8%) patients developed complications after GKRS; 20 (13.4%) of these patients had transient adverse radiological effects (perilesional edema developed). Predictors for complication appearance were higher prescription isodose volume (p = 0.005) and 12-Gy isodose line volume (V12; p = 0.001), higher Pollock-Flickinger (p = 0.02) and Virginia scores (p = 0.003), and lower beam-on time (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The BED was the strongest predictor of obliteration of unruptured AVMs after upfront GKRS. A radiosurgical score comprising the BED is proposed. The V12 appears as a predictor for both efficacy and toxicity. Beam-on time was illustrated as statistically significant for both obliteration and complication appearance. The radiation dose rate did not influence obliteration in the current analysis. The exact BED threshold remains to be established by further studies.

1515,Excluded,"Biophysical analyses of synthetic amyloid-beta(1-42) aggregates before and after covalent cross-linking. Implications for deducing the structure of endogenous amyloid-beta oligomers A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of large numbers of senile plaques in the brain. These deposits are rich in fibrils that are composed of 40- and 42-residue amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Several lines of evidence indicate that soluble Abeta aggregates as well as fibrils are important in the etiology of AD. Low levels of endogenous soluble Abeta aggregates make them difficult to characterize, but several species in extracts of AD brains have been detected by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and immunoblotting. Individual Abeta oligomers ranging in size from dimers through dodecamers of 4 kDa monomeric Abeta have been resolved in other laboratories as discrete species by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In an effort to reconstitute soluble Abeta aggregates in vitro that resemble the endogenous soluble Abeta aggregates, we previously found that monomeric Abeta(1-42) rapidly forms soluble oligomers in the presence of dilute SDS micelles. Here we extend this work in two directions. First, we contrast the size and secondary structure of these oligomers with those of synthetic Abeta(1-42) fibrils. SEC and multiangle light scattering were used to obtain a molecular mass of 150 kDa for the isolated oligomers. The oligomers partially dissociated to monomers through nonamers when incubated with SDS, but in contrast to endogenous oligomers, we saw no evidence of these discrete species prior to SDS treatment. One hypothesis to explain this difference is that endogenous oligomers are stabilized by covalent cross-linking induced by unknown cellular agents. To explore this hypothesis, optimal mass spectrometry (MS) analysis procedures need to be developed for Abeta cross-linked in vitro. In our second series of studies, we began this process by treating monomeric and aggregated Abeta(1-42) with three cross-linking agents: transglutaminase, glutaraldehyde, and Cu(II) with peroxide. We compared the efficiency of covalent cross-linking with these agents, the effect of cross-linking on peptide secondary structure, the stability of the cross-linked structures to thermal unfolding, and the sites of peptide cross-linking obtained from proteolysis and MS."
2166,Excluded,"PKC{alpha} is essential for the proper activation and termination of rod bipolar cell response PURPOSE: Protein kinase (PKC)-alpha is abundant in retinal bipolar cells. This study was performed to explore its role in visual processing.METHODS: PKCalpha-knockout (Prkca(-/-)) mice and control animals were examined by using electroretinography (ERG), light microscopy, and immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The Prkca(-/-) mice showed no signs of retinal degeneration up to 12 months of age, but ERG measurements indicated a decelerated increase in the ascending limb of the scotopic (rod-sensitive) b-wave as well as a delayed return to baseline. These results suggest that PKCalpha is an important modulator that affects bipolar cell signal transduction and termination. Confocal microscopy of retinal sections showed that PKCalpha co-localized with calbindin, which indicates a PKCalpha localization in close proximity to the horizontal cell terminals. In addition, the implicit time of the ERG c-wave originating from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the recovery of photoreceptors from bleaching conditions were substantially faster in the knockout mice than in the wild-type control animals.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PKCalpha is a modulator of rod-bipolar cell function by accelerating glutamate-driven signal transduction and termination. This modulation is of importance in the switch between scotopic and photopic vision. Furthermore, PKCalpha seems to play a role in RPE function."
411,Included,"Radiosurgery of the rat hippocampus: magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological, histological, and behavioral studies OBJECTIVE: To explore the histological, electrophysiological, radiological, and behavioral effects of radiosurgery using a new model of proton beam radiosurgery (PBR) of the rodent hippocampus.METHODS: Forty-one rats underwent PBR of the right hippocampus with nominal doses of 5 to 130 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE). Three control animals were untreated. Three months after PBR, 41 animals were evaluated with the Morris water maze, 23 with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 22 with intrahippocampal microelectrode recordings. Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain. Three months after PBR, the irradiated rat hippocampus demonstrates necrosis at 90 CGE, but not at 60 CGE, with associated abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging, physiology, and memory testing. HSP-72 was up-regulated at nonnecrotic doses."
2412,Excluded,"Radiosensitivity and differentiation of ganglion cells within fetal mouse retinal explants in vitro Fetal mouse retinas were explanted at 13-14 days of gestation, and exposed to gamma radiation in vitro. Not all regions of the retina were equally susceptible to radiation-induced necrosis; when exposed to 5000 rads soon after explanation, each explant had a single small radioresistant nubbin of apparently intact tissue, located near the optic nerve-head. This region of radioresistant tissue was larger when the dose of radiation was reduced and when the explants were exposed at later times in vitro, indicating the existence of a gradient of radioresistance across retinal explants which spread outward through at least the first week in vitro, the period examined. Based upon the extensive in situ literature which has correlated the emergence of radioresistance with the differentiation of retinal neurons, we conclude that the in situ central-to-peripheral sequence of cellular differentiation continues in vitro within our retinal explants. Whereas the ganglion cell axonal outgrowth from control retinas grown in isolation on collagen substrates underwent a gradual disintegration over 3 weeks in vitro, the sparse axonal outgrowth from explants exposed to 5000 rads disintegrated abruptly at 5-7 days in vitro. This did not appear to be due to direct damage from radiation, but instead reflected the fact that axons in irradiated cultures arose from central retinal regions only, while many axons in control cultures emerged from later-differentiating peripheral regions. We suggest that disintegration of individual axons in the outgrowth may occur rapidly and in a central-to-peripheral sequence. These findings should be useful in designing assays for trophic factors which may prevent ganglion cell axon disintegration in this in vitro model system."
537,Excluded,"Concurrent capecitabine and whole-brain radiotherapy for treatment of brain metastases in breast cancer patients Preclinical data have demonstrated that ionizing radiation acts synergistically with capecitabine. This report retrospectively assessed the use of capecitabine concurrently with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. From January 2003 to March 2005, five breast cancer patients with brain metastases were referred for WBRT with concurrent capecitabine. Median age was 44 years (range: 38-53). The median dose of capecitabine was 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days (day1-14). Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days, concurrently with WBRT (30 Gy, 3 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week). Median survival after starting WBRT plus capecitabine was 6.5 months (range 1-34 months). One patient achieved a complete response. Two patients achieved partial response, including one with local control lasting until most recent follow-up. One patient had stable disease. The remaining patient was not assessable for response because of early death. Most commonly reported adverse events were nausea (n = 2) and headache (n = 2), always grade 1. Other toxicities were grade 3 hand/foot syndrome (n = 1), moderate anemia requiring transfusion and dose reduction of capecitabine (n = 1), and grade 1 mucositis (n = 1). Although promising, these preliminary data warrant further assessment of capecitabine-based chemoradiation in brain metastases from breast cancer and need to be further validated in the setting of a clinical trial."
2757,Excluded,"Magnetic resonance based small animal radiotherapy in neuro-oncology Compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides vastly superior soft-tissue contrast. This makes it much easier to visualize lesion boundaries that will result in a much better delineation of the target volume, helping to better irradiate the lesion and avoid surrounding tissue.Therefore, combining MRI with CT data is increasingly used for radiotherapy planning in the clinic. This combined CT/MRI dataset contains both the information required for targeting and for dose calculations. During this presentation, three studies will be presented where MRI and small animal radiotherapy were combined in the field of neuro-oncology. In a first study, we used a combined CT/MRI dataset to guide the irradiation of brain tumours in a F98 glioblastoma rat model using a micro-irradiator. Contrast-enhanced MRI images were acquired to follow up tumour growth after orthotopic inoculation, to monitor treatment response, and to delineate the target volume during radiotherapy planning. Using multiple non-coplanar arcs the prescribed dose could be delivered to 90% of the target volume, while minimizing the dose to normal brain tissue. A challenging aspects of small animal CT imaging relates to the radiation dose received by the animals. This might become a very important issue when the therapeutic dose has to be delivered in multiple fractions spaced over time, where each individual irradiation requires a CT for accurate animal positioning. Therefore, in a second study we investigated the feasibility of a MRI-only based workflow for radiotherapy planning of the rat brain, that enables both accurate target delineation and accurate dose calculations using only MRI-based volumes. Multiple MRI sequences were used to generate synthetic CT images that could be used for dose calculations, because only one MRI volume was not sufficient to separate all major tissue types (air, soft tissue, bone) in the rat head. The synthetic CT images were sufficiently similar to the segmented CT images that are routinely used for radiotherapy planning on preclinical radiation research platforms. No significant differences were observed between CT and MRI based dose calculations when more complex beam configurations (multiple beams) were used in the dose plan. However, further research is required in the thoracic or abdominal region of small animals, where more tissue classes will be required to allow for accurate dose calculations compared to the rat head. Finally, discrimination between brain tumor recurrence (glioblastoma) and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional MRI. Functional imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. A third study will be presented to investigate the potential of DCE-MRI and PET in discriminating high-grade glioma from RN in rats. Induction of RN was achieved by irradiating the right frontal region with 60 Gy using multiple arcs. Results suggested that functional imaging can be used to discriminate glioblastoma (recurrence) from RN. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

Contents of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma and IL-4 in serum were measured and changes of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoid (GC) in serum were analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunologic assay, respectively at different time points post wound and radiation.RESULTS: (1) The level of IFN-gamma, one of the Th1 cell cytokines increased significantly at 14 d post CWR, which was markedly higher than that in control group and wound group. However, the level of IL-4, IL-1beta and IL-6, one of the Th2 cell cytokines, did not show obvious change. (2) Ratio of Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) in wound group and CWR group increased significantly at 7 d after wound and radiation, which suggested that Th1/Th2 balance drifted to Th1 immune response. The ratio of Th1/Th2 in wound group returned to the normal level up to 14 d after the wound and radiation, while the Th1/Th2 ratio in CWR group increased persistently and was much higher than that in control and wound groups. (3) Level of serous ACTH and GC in CWR group increased at 3 d post wound and radiation, and among them, level of GC showed statistically significant increase, which was much higher than that in control and wound groups.CONCLUSION: Level of serous neurohormone GC in rats increased significantly immediately after wound and radiation; while the level of IFN-gamma showed significant increase only up to 14 d after wound and radiation, and the Th1/Th2 imbalance sustained till 28 d post wound and radiation. In order to reduce acute damage caused by CWR, organic immune system and nerve system showed up a marked regulate effects simultaneously and mutually. Nonetheless, the excessive stress induced by CWR causes disturbance of immunoregulation, which is one of the key reasons for delayed wound healing in CWR."
3147,Excluded,"The dual-peak light response of ganglion cells in chicken retina In the present study, a particular temporal pattern of the ganglion cells' light response specified as ""dual-peak"" was observed. In the chicken retina (N=15), about 37.5% (174 out of 464) of the ganglion cells showed such special temporal property in response to the onset of light flash. These neurons responded to light stimulus with two successive components: a transient increase of firing rate which lasted for less than 100 ms, and another prolonged light response appeared in about 100 ms after the first transient response. Moreover, our data demonstrated a temporal adaptation process in the later phase of firing activities when repeated flashes were applied. Meanwhile, the earlier phase had a more stable latency in response to the stimulus. Application of picrotoxin could evoke the dual-peak responses in transient ganglion cells. These results suggest that the origination of the two response components might be distinct and the later one is likely related to GABAergic pathways."

Material(s) and Method(s): Our phantom comprised two components, i.e., a hollow-fiber hemodialyzer to pump the diluted contrast material and a surrounding syringe-shaped X-ray-absorbing body to simulate the absorption of X-rays by a brain and cranium. We performed CTP scans on the phantom under various dose conditions ranging from 20 to 140 mA using a 64-row CT scanner, measuring experimental cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP) values using a deconvolution algorithm. Result(s): The theoretical value of the CBV was within the 95% confidence interval of CBV values measured under 80 mA. The CBV measured under low-dose settings and all CBF values measured were smaller than the theoretically calculated ones, and all MTT values measured were larger. All measured values of the CBV, CBF, MTT, and TTP decreased with an increase in image noise under lower dose conditions. Conclusion(s): It is difficult to define a low-dose limit in clinical scan conditions because of the complex characteristics of perfusion indices. Copyright Â© 2017, Japan Radiological Society."

GBM is usually managed by neurosurgery followed by both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since GBM develops resistance to conventional therapies, treatment with C-ions is promising to completely eradicate the tumoural mass. During cranial irradiation, exposure of healthy tissues is inevitable. Because of the presence of neural stem cells, a deep investigation on the effects of C-ion irradiation with respect to X-ray induced damage is mandatory to allow a better definition of treatments. In this work, the comparison of X-rays and C-ion irradiation-induced effects on human neural stem cell, focusing on multiple endpoints, such as cell viability, cytokine secretion and spheroid formation is presented. Results show different temporal and dose responses of human neural stem cells to the different radiation qualities, suggesting different underpinning mechanisms of radiation-induced damages."
1116,Excluded,"Short-term hazards of low-dose radioiodine ablation therapy in postsurgical thyroid cancer patients During the last two decades, there has been a trend to use low-dose I-131 ablation therapy in patients with thyroid carcinoma without metastases. However, information regarding the incidence of acute adverse reactions in patients after low-dose radioiodine therapy has not been reported. In this study, the acute radiation effects after low-dose radioiodine ablation therapy in postsurgical differentiated thyroid cancer patients was evaluated. Fifty-six patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were prospectively evaluated. None of these patients had evidence of a distant metastasis. All patients received 40 mCi (1480 MBq) I-131 MIBG orally and were evaluated for symptoms and signs by a physician on the second and seventh days after therapy. Xerostomia and nausea were the most common complaints with the same incidence rate of 5.35%. Gastralgia occurred at a frequency of 3.57%. Pain in the thyroid bed, tenderness over a parotid gland, submandibular glands, change in taste, and vomiting all were found at a frequency of 1.78%. Maximum reactions generally occurred 24-48 hours after therapy. All the symptoms except for xerostomia resolved completely in most patients within a week. In comparison with high-dose ablation therapy published in the literature, the incidence of radiation reactions in low-dose radioiodine therapy was much lower. It was concluded that in patients without lymph node or distant metastases, low-dose I-131 MIBG therapy may be recommended to avoid the high incidence of local complications after high-dose treatment."
1107,Excluded,"Can a comparison of clinical and deep space irradiation scenarios shed light on the radiation response of the brain? Not surprisingly, our knowledge of the impact of radiation on the brain has evolved considerably. Decades of work have struggled with identifying the critical cellular targets in the brain, the latency of functional change and understanding how irradiation alters the balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Radiation-induced cell kill following clinical fractionation paradigms pointed to both stromal and parenchymal targets but also defined an exquisite sensitivity of neurogenic populations of newly born cells in the brain. It became more and more apparent too, that acute (days) events transpiring after exposure were poorly prognostic of the late (months-years) waves of radiation injury believed to underlie neurocognitive deficits. Much of these gaps in knowledge persisted as NASA became interested in how exposure to much different radiation types, doses and dose rates that characterize the space radiation environment might impair central nervous system functionality, with possibly negative implications for deep space travel. Now emerging evidence from researchers engaged in clinical, translational and environmental radiation sciences have begun to fill these gaps and have uncovered some surprising similarities in the response of the brain to seemingly disparate exposure scenarios. This article highlights many of the commonalities between the vastly different irradiation paradigms that distinguish clinical treatments from occupational exposures in deep space."

Currently, laser irradiation with an infrared (830 nm) wavelength for analgesia is being used very successfully in a number of dental procedures. Study: Thus far, however, the effect of laser irradiation has been limited to analgesia. Recently Dr. Roberta Chow has reported a great deal of success by utilizing the visible red wavelength in the peripheral nerves. Preliminary results have indicated there is great analgesia being obtained, and in some cases, it hs been thought that anesthesia has been achieved.

Leukemia cell sensitization to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation is achieved by upregulation of ROS production and/or downregulation of antioxidative enzymes. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the potential role of fullerenol nanoparticle in modulation of the leukemic cellular response to irradiation. We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated (IR) and FNP pre-treated irradiated cells (FNP + IR) K562 cells, and compared gene expression level with the overall cell survival, determined by DET and MTT assays. Interesting result of similar percentage of cell survival in FNP and FNP + IR groups (67.9% versus 63%), indicated the possible protective effect of FNP in irradiated cells. Under oxidative stress induced by radiation, cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 were upregulated in FNP pretreated K562 cells in comparison with control group, IR and FNP - treated non-irradiated cells. Amongst the antioxidative enzymes, only the mRNA of Cu, Zn - SOD (SOD-1) was downregulated, while gGT, GPX and GSTP1 were not significantly modulated in FNP-treated irradiated cells. Together with survival data and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL genes, our results may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy."
1959,Excluded,"[Radiation-induced neuropathies: collateral damage of improved cancer prognosis] INTRODUCTION: Because of the improvement of cancer prognosis, long-term damages of treatments become a medical and public health problem. Among the iatrogenic complications, neurological impairment is crucial to consider since motor disability and pain have a considerable impact on quality of life of long cancer survivors. However, radiation-induced neuropathies have not been the focus of great attention. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated review about the radiation-induced lesions of the peripheral nerve system.STATE OF THE ART: Radiation-induced neuropathies are characterized by their heterogeneity in both symptoms and disease course. Signs and symptoms depend on the affected structures of the peripheral nerve system (nerve roots, nerve plexus or nerve trunks). Early-onset complications are often transient and late complications are usually progressive and associated with a poor prognosis. The most frequent and well known is delayed radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, which may follow breast cancer irradiation. Radiation-induced lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy is characterized by pure or predominant lower motor neuron signs. They can be misdiagnosed, confused with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or with leptomeningeal metastases since nodular MRI enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content can be observed. In the absence of specific markers of the link with radiotherapy, the diagnosis of post-radiation neuropathy may be difficult. Recently, a posteriori conformal radiotherapy with 3D dosimetric reconstitution has been developed to link a precise anatomical site to unexpected excess irradiation.PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION: The importance of early diagnosis of radiation-induced neuropathies is underscored by the emergence of new disease-modifying treatments. Although the pathophysiology is not fully understood, it is already possible to target radiation-induced fibrosis but also associated factors such as ischemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. A phase III trial evaluating the association of pentoxifylline, tocopherol and clodronate (PENTOCLO, NCT01291433) in radiation-induced neuropathies is now recruiting."
2931,Excluded,"Use of the dog spleen for studying effects of irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents, with suggested uses of other organs The irradiation of the exteriorized spleen of the dog, with the animal lead-shielded, produced constant changes in the white blood cells. The time of recovery from the irradiation effect was determined. The normal canine spleen could handle live pneumococci injected into the splenic artery, as proven by sterile cultures of splenic vein samples. The size of the bolus used was determined by repeated trials and proved to be one billion pneumococci per pound of body weight. The capacity of the irradiated spleen to handle this number of pneumococci was impaired. It was found that whole body irradiation, nitrogen mustard, thio-tepa, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, and azothioprine all impaired this capacity of the spleen. The dose of the chemotherapeutic agent was the same in milligrams per kilogram as that used in the cancer clinic. A method for determining the recovery time following the use of one or more agents was developed with the repeated use of the spleen model. By extending the methods used with the spleen it was found that similar use could be made, usually without surgery, of the liver, gut, and lungs (and probably the kidney and brain)."
2742,Excluded,"A colourful clock Circadian rhythms are an essential property of life on Earth. In mammals, these rhythms are coordinated by a small set of neurons, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The environmental light/dark cycle synchronizes (entrains) the SCN via a distinct pathway, originating in a subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that utilize the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4). The pRGCs are also innervated by rods and cones and, so, are both endogenously and exogenously light sensitive. Accumulating evidence has shown that the circadian system is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), blue, and green wavelengths of light. However, it was unclear whether colour perception itself can help entrain the SCN. By utilizing both behavioural and electrophysiological recording techniques, Walmsley and colleagues show that multiple photic channels interact and enhance the capacity of the SCN to synchronize to the environmental cycle. Thus, entrainment of the circadian system combines both environmental irradiance and colour information to ensure that internal and external time are appropriately aligned."

Patients were assessed immediately prior to treatment, and again within a week of finishing. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Bidimensional Fatigue Scale (BFS). Quality of life was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQc30). Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Personality Traits were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). Fatigue severity increased significantly on 3 out of the 5 assessment instruments used. Radiotherapy was associated with a decline in global quality of life, role, cognitive and social functioning, and an increase in nausea/vomiting, pain, insomnia, diarrhea, and financial difficulty. At baseline, 39% of the variation in fatigue scores among the patients could be explained by a combination of measures of their global quality of life and physical functioning. A combination of fatigue and anxiety scores at baseline was able to predict 54% of the variation in fatigue scores at the completion of radiotherapy. These data indicate that fatigue is a significant problem for patients receiving radical radiotherapy, although its severity is relatively modest."
2169,Excluded,"Tactile situation awareness system: proprioceptive prostheses for sensory deficiencies UNLABELLED: Pilots and astronauts do not experience spatial disorientation in normal day-to-day terrestrial activities. On the ground, the perception of position and motion is determined by central nervous system integration of concordant and redundant information from multiple sensory channels (somatosensory, vestibular and visual) which collectively yield veridical perceptions. In the acceleration environments experienced by pilots and astronauts, the somatosensory and vestibular senses frequently present false but concordant information concerning the direction of gravity or down. When presented with conflicting sensory stimuli, it is normal for pilots and astronauts to experience episodes of disorientation. Visual instruments and displays developed over the past 70 yr have not solved the problem. A simple solution to maintain spatial orientation is to provide true information using the same sensory channels we use so successfully on Earth.METHODS: The Tactile Situation Awareness System (TSAS) developed by NASA and the U.S. Navy uses a matrix of mechanical tactile stimulators (tactors) applied on the torso and limbs to convey orientation cues (e.g., gravity vector) in an intuitive fashion to the skin. A series of in-flight experiments to validate and test a variety of tactile displays and concepts has been carried out in both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.RESULTS: Pilots were able to fly complex maneuvers with no instruments or outside visual references (blindfolded) with less than 20 min of training. Recovery from unusual attitudes solely by tactile cues was trivial. Lab tests have shown the TSAS improves performance under conditions of high workload.CONCLUSIONS: When orientation information is presented via intuitive tactile displays spatial orientation is easily maintained in altered sensory conditions including unusual acceleration environments."
183,Excluded,"Magnetic fields alter electrical properties of solutions and their physiological effects Calcium chloride and snail physiological salt solutions were exposed to static magnetic fields (2.3-350 mT), and the physical properties of the solutions as well as their biologic effects were studied. Our preliminary observations show that these fields alter physicochemical properties of CaCl2 solutions and the functional effects of physiological solutions. Experiments on CaCl2 solutions demonstrated field-dependent changes of electrical conductivity, with the magnitude and the direction of conductivity change being a function of both concentration and field intensity. The changes in conductivity were maintained for periods in excess of 1 h after exposure. Conductivity changes were not found after exposure of physiological solutions to static magnetic fields, but changes of biological consequence did occur. Other experiments showed that there were several changes in cellular function observed in ganglia and isolated neurons of Helix pomatia when the perfusing medium was changed from the normal physiologic solution to the same solution after exposure to magnetic fields. These changes include membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge, reduced uptake of Ca into cells, altered content of cyclic nucleotides in ganglia, and increased volume of isolated cell bodies. A change in hydration of calcium ions may be one of the consequences of magnetic-field exposure, and in physiological solutions this change may have functional consequences."
285,Excluded,"Dexamethasone-related adrenal insufficiency in patients with brain and skull base tumours Purpose or Objective This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in a cohort of patients with brain and skull base tumours and to identify factors which may predict its occurrence. Material and Methods Patients with brain or skull base tumours attending for a short synacthen test (SST) at a single institution between October 2010 and January 2014 were retrospectively identified. Baseline demographics and dexamethasone exposure was scrutinised. Fisher's Exact, Student's ttest, Mann-Whitney and the Kendall's tau-b were used to evaluate differences between patients who passed or failed the SST. Results Thirty-one of 51 patients with previous dexamethasone exposure failed their first SST (61%). Duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone was significantly different between pass and fail groups (p=0.001 and p=0.007 respectively). No significant relationship was demonstrated between age, gender, diagnosis or mean pituitary radiation dose and SST results. Receiver operator characteristic curves generated suggest both duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone are acceptable discriminators when predicting SST failure. These curves generate values of 78 days and 171 milligram days respectively with optimum sensitivity (i.e. ability to detect SST failures.) Conclusion These values may be used clinically to identify patients at higher risk of adrenal suppression who require empirical hydrocortisone pending formal testing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis."

Dose prescription was set to 16 x 3.63 Gy (total dose 58.08 Gy). The clinical target volume was the entire vocal cord. Setup verification was done by means of an online correction protocol using cone beam computed tomography. Data for voice quality assessment were collected prospectively at baseline, end of treatment, and 4, 6, and 12 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment using VHI questionnaires.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 7-50 months), the 2-year local control and overall survival rates were 100% and 90% because no single local recurrence was reported and 3 patients died because of comorbidity. All patients have completed the intended treatment schedule; no treatment interruptions and no grade 3 acute toxicity were reported. Grade 2 acute dermatitis or dysphagia was reported in only 5 patients (17%). No serious late toxicity was reported; only 1 patient developed temporary grade 2 laryngeal edema, and responded to a short-course of corticosteroid. The VHI improved significantly, from 33.5 at baseline to 9.5 and 10 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively (P<.001). The control group, treated to the whole larynx, had comparable local control rates (92.2% vs 100%, P=.24) but more acute toxicity (66% vs 17%, P<.0001) and higher VHI scores (23.8 and 16.7 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively, P<.0001).CONCLUSION: Single vocal cord irradiation is feasible and resulted in maximal local control rate at 2 years. The deterioration in VHI scores was slight and temporary and subsequently improved to normal levels. Long-term follow-up is needed to consolidate these promising results."

Patients were examined with (11)C-L-methionine PET and MRI prior to treatment and after 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Temporal changes in methionine uptake ratio, meningioma volume, meningioma regrowth and clinical symptoms throughout the follow-up period were evaluated.RESULTS: In 17 patients the tumour volume was unchanged throughout the follow-up. The methionine uptake ratio on PET decreased over the years in most patients. In two patients the tumour remnant showed progression on MRI. In these patients, prior to the volume increase on MRI, the methionine uptake ratio increased. One patient experienced transient clinical symptoms and showed radiological evidence of a radiation-induced reaction close to the irradiated field.CONCLUSION: Proton beam treatment is a safe and effective treatment for achieving long-term growth arrest in meningioma remnants. Follow-up with (11)C-L-methionine PET may be a valuable adjunct to, but not a replacement for, standard radiological follow-up."

384,Excluded,"Effects of oxygen and bFGF on the vulnerability of photoreceptors to light damage PURPOSE: To test whether tissue oxygen levels affect the vulnerability of photoreceptors to damage by bright continuous light (BCL).METHODS: Albino rats were raised in standard conditions of cyclic light (12-hour light, 12-hour darkness) with the light level at 5 to 10 lux or 40 to 65 lux. They were then exposed to BCL (1000-1400 lux), either continuously for 48 hours or for the day or night components of the 48-hour period. During BCL, some rats were kept in room air (normoxia, 21% oxygen), some in hypoxia (10%), and some in hyperoxia (70%). Their retinas were examined for cell death, for the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and for response to light (electroretinogram, ERG).RESULTS: The death of retinal cells induced by BCL was confined to photoreceptors. Within the retina, the severity of death was inversely related to the level of bFGF immunolabeling in the somas of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) before exposure. The death of photoreceptors was accompanied by an upregulation of bFGF protein levels in the ONL and by a decline in the ERG. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia during BCL reduced the photoreceptor death, bFGF upregulation, and ERG decline caused by BCL. The protective effects of hyperoxia and hypoxia were evident during both the day and night halves of the daily cycle. Hypoxia or hyperoxia alone did not upregulate bFGF or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) expression in the retina.CONCLUSIONS: Photoreceptors are protected from light damage by hypoxia and hyperoxia during exposure. The protection provided by oxygen levels operates during both day and night. The protection is not mediated by an upregulation of bFGF or CNTF."

The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells.

This study sought to investigate modification of the radiation response in a rat 9L brain tumor model in vivo by the wild-type p53 gene (wtp53). Determination of the timing and dose of radiation therapy required the assessment of the duration of the effect of wtp53 expression on 9L tumors after in vivo transfection. Methods. Anesthetized male F-344 rats each were stereotactically inoculated with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> 9L gliosarcoma cells through a skull screw into the cerebrum in the right frontal region. Twelve-day-old tumors were inoculated through the screw with recombinant adenoviral vectors under isoflurane anaesthesia: control rats with Ad5/RSV/GL2 (carrying the luciferase gene), and study rats with Ad5CMV-p53 (carrying the wtp53 gene). Brain tumors removed at specific times after transfection were measured, homogenized, and lysed and wtp53 expression determined by Western blot analysis. Four groups of nine rats were, subsequently, implanted with iodine-125 seeds 15 days post-tumor inoculation to give a minimum tumor dose of 40 or 60 Gy. Results. We demonstrated transfer of wtp53 into rat 9L tumors in vivo using the Ad5CMV-p53 vector. The expression of wtp53 was demonstrated to be maximum between days 1 and 3 post-vector inoculation. Tumors expressing wtp53 were smaller than controls transfected with Ad5/RSV/GL2 but this difference was not statistically significant. Radiation made a significant difference to the survival of tumor-bearing rats. Moreover, wtp53 expression conferred a significant additional survival advantage. Conclusion. The expression of wtp53 significantly improves the survival of irradiated tumor-bearing rats in our model."

OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN).METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months.RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479).CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope."

3132,Excluded,"Photoresponse diversity among the five types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate non-image-forming visual responses, including pupillary constriction, circadian photoentrainment and suppression of pineal melatonin secretion. Five morphological types of ipRGCs, M1-M5, have been identified in mice. In order to understand their functions better, we studied the photoresponses of all five cell types, by whole-cell recording from fluorescently labelled ipRGCs visualized using multiphoton microscopy. All ipRGC types generated melanopsin-based ('intrinsic') as well as synaptically driven ('extrinsic') light responses. The intrinsic photoresponses of M1 cells were lower threshold, higher amplitude and faster than those of M2-M5. The peak amplitudes of extrinsic light responses differed among the ipRGC types; however, the responses of all cell types had comparable thresholds, kinetics and waveforms, and all cells received rod input. While all five types exhibited inhibitory amacrine-cell and excitatory bipolar-cell inputs from the 'on' channel, M1 and M3 received additional 'off'-channel inhibition, possibly through their 'off'-sublamina dendrites. The M2-M5 ipRGCs had centre-surround-organized receptive fields, implicating a capacity to detect spatial contrast. In contrast, the receptive fields of M1 cells lacked surround antagonism, which might be caused by the surround of the inhibitory input nullifying the surround of the excitatory input. All ipRGCs responded robustly to a wide range of motion speeds, and M1-M4 cells appeared tuned to different speeds, suggesting that they might analyse the speed of motion. Retrograde labelling revealed that M1-M4 cells project to the superior colliculus, suggesting that the contrast and motion information signalled by these cells could be used by this sensorimotor area to detect novel objects and motion in the visual field."

1773,Excluded,"Neuromagnetic responses to chords are modified by preceding musical scale Previous psychological studies have shown that musical chords primed by Western musical scale in a tonal and modal schema are perceived in a hierarchy of stability. We investigated such priming effects on auditory magnetic responses to tonic-major and submediant-minor chords preceded by major scales and tonic-minor and submediant-major chords preceded by minor scales. Musically trained subjects participated in the experiment. During MEG recordings, subjects judged perceptual stability of the chords. The tonic chords were judged to be stable, whereas the submediant chords were judged to be unstable. Dipole moments of N1m response originating in the auditory cortex were larger in the left hemisphere for the submediant chords than for the tonic chords preceded by the major but not minor scales. No difference in the N1m or P2m moment was found for the chords presented without preceding scales. These results suggest priming effects of the tonal schema, interacting with contextual modality, on neural activity of the auditory cortex as well as perceptual stability of the chords. It is inferred that modulation of the auditory cortical activity is associated with attention induced by tonal instability and modality shift, which characterize the submediant chords."

The functional role of the amino acid residues contributing to the channel pore in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors is not well understood. We characterized the contribution of TMD2 position V7' to channel gating in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute position alpha3 (V7') with four different amino acids (A, F, S, or Y) and coexpressed each mutant subunit with wild-type (WT) beta2 or beta4 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Whole-cell voltage clamp experiments show that substitution for an alanine, serine, or phenylalanine decreased by 2.3-6.2-fold the ACh-EC(50) for alpha3beta2 and alpha3beta4 receptor subtypes. Interestingly, mutation V7'Y did not produce a significant change in ACh-EC(50) when coexpressed with the beta2 subunit but showed a significant approximately two-fold increase with beta4. Similar responses were obtained with nicotine as the agonist. The antagonist sensitivity of the mutant channels was assessed by using dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) and methyllycaconitine (MLA). The apparent potency of DHbetaE as an antagonist increased by approximately 3.7- and 11-fold for the alpha3beta2 V7'S and V7'F mutants, respectively, whereas no evident changes in antagonist potency were observed for the V7'A and V7'Y mutants. The V7'S and V7'F mutations increase MLA antagonist potency for the alpha3beta4 receptor by approximately 6.2- and approximately 9.3-fold, respectively. The V7'A mutation selectively increases the MLA antagonist potency for the alpha3beta4 receptor by approximately 18.7-fold. These results indicate that position V7' contributes to channel gating kinetics and pharmacology of the neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors."

The whole-brain irradiation (WBI) of 15 Gy in three fractions was delivered to C57BL/6 mice before implantation of GL261 glioma cells. The changes in vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) after WBI were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell invasion assays were performed to study the effects of VEGF and SDF-1alpha. The levels of VEGF and SDF-1alpha in normal brain tissues increased after 15 Gy WBI. The WBI before tumor implantation significantly increased the invasive ability of GL261 cells. VEGF and SDF-1alpha could promote invasion of GL261 cells even after high-dose irradiation. The combination of irradiation and inhibitors such as AMD3100 may prevent irradiation-stimulated dissemination of glioma cells.

Background Abnormal DTI measures of the superior cerebellar peduncles were reported in PSP-RS patients. A few studies showed that PSP-RS patients had DTI alterations also in the corpus callosum, internal capsulae, and long-range WM tracts. However, most of the previous studies did not include the atypical clinical presentations of PSP. Design/Methods: In 37 PSP (21 PSP-RS, 16 PSP-P) and 42 controls, tract-based spatial statistics was applied. DTI metrics were derived from supratentorial, thalamic, and infratentorial tracts. Brain atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, fronto-parietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P. When MRPI and DTI measures were combined, the discriminatory power increased from 0.92 to 0.98 for PSP-RS vs. controls, from 0.70 to 0.82 for PSP-P vs. controls, and from 0.77 to 0.84 for PSP-RS vs. PSP-P. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of GM and WM alterations occur in PSP-RS and PSP-P. Adding DTI measures to MRPI improves the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating each PSP syndrome from healthy individuals and each other."

The ability of newest radiation techniques including IMRT and proton therapy to generate steep dose gradients may yield more accurate models in the future. Some toxicities are severe and irreversible, leading to vision loss, as in the case of radiation-induced optic neuropathy for which curative treatments are suboptimal.

732,Excluded,"The discovery and development of new potential antioxidant agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases Introduction: Several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases have had associations with the oxidative process and free radical damage. Consequently, in past decades, several natural and synthetic antioxidants have been assessed as therapeutic agents but have shown limitations in bioavailability, metabolic susceptibility and permeability to the blood brain barrier. Given these issues, medicinal chemists are hard at work to modify/improve the chemical structures of these antioxidants, thereby improving their efficacy. Areas covered: In this review, the authors critically analyze several biological mechanisms involved in the generation of free radicals. Additionally, they analyze free radicals' role in the generation of oxidative stress and in the progression of many NDs. Further, the authors review a collection of natural and synthetic antioxidants, their role as free radical scavengers along with their mechanisms of action and their potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Expert opinion: So far, preclinical studies on several antioxidants have shown promise for treating NDs, despite their limitations. The authors do highlight the lack of the adequate animal models for preclinical assessment and this does hinder further progression into clinical trials. Further studies are necessary to fully investigate the potential of these antioxidants as ND therapeutic options. Â© Informa UK, Ltd."
774,Excluded,"Long INterspersed element-1 mobility as a sensor of environmental stresses Long INterspersed element (LINE-1, L1) retrotransposons are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome, constituting approximately 17%. They move by a ""copy-paste"" mechanism, involving reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and insertion of its cDNA copy at a new site in the genome. L1 retrotransposition (L1-RTP) can cause insertional mutations, alter gene expression, transduce exons, and induce epigenetic dysregulation. L1-RTP is generally repressed; however, a number of observations collected over about 15 years revealed that it can occur in response to environmental stresses. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that L1-RTP can play a role in the onset of several neurological and oncological diseases in humans. In recent years, great attention has been paid to the exposome paradigm, which proposes that health effects of an environmental factor should be evaluated considering both cumulative environmental exposures and the endogenous processes resulting from the biological response. L1-RTP could be an endogenous process considered for this application. Here, we summarize the current understanding of environmental factors that can affect the retrotransposition of human L1 elements. Evidence indicates that L1-RTP alteration is triggered by numerous and various environmental stressors, such as chemical agents (heavy metals, carcinogens, oxidants, and drugs), physical agents (ionizing and non-ionizing radiations), and experiential factors (voluntary exercise, social isolation, maternal care, and environmental light/dark cycles). These data come from in vitro studies on cell lines and in vivo studies on transgenic animals: future investigations should be focused on physiologically relevant models to gain a better understanding of this topic."

Because extended exposure to visible light can be toxic to cells, it is important to characterize the effects of light stimulation on cellular function in the absence of optogenetic proteins. Here we exposed mouse cortical cultures with no exogenous optogenetic proteins to several hours of flashing blue, red, or green light. We found that exposing these cultures to as short as 1 h of blue light, but not red or green light, results in an increase in the expression of neuronal activity-regulated genes. Our findings suggest that blue light stimulation is ill suited to long-term optogenetic experiments, especially those that measure transcription, and they emphasize the importance of performing light-only control experiments in samples without optogenetic proteins."

Here, we show that oxidative damage of wild type SOD at physiological concentrations ( approximately 40 microm) results in destabilization and aggregation in vitro. Oxidation of either mutant or wild type SOD1 causes the enzyme to dissociate to monomers prior to aggregation. Only small changes in secondary and tertiary structure are associated with monomer formation. These results indicate a common aggregation prone monomeric intermediate for wild type and fALS-associated mutant SODs and provides a link between sporadic and familial ALS."

In this study, we analysed the treatment parameters and outcomes of our cranial meningioma patients treated with SRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 103 cranial meningioma lesions of 93 patients were treated with CyberKnife (Accurayw) Stereotactic Radiosurgery Unit. 42 patients (45%) received SRT as primary modality, and 51 patients ( 55 %) received postoperatively. Six patients have treated with external beam radiotherapy. Of the 103 cases, 69 of the lesions were located basally, 34 of them nonbasally. The most common symptoms in patients with basal tumours (38 patients, 58%) was detoriation in the visual field and the restriction of the eye movements and in patients with non-basal tumours (8 patients, 26%) was headache. In 33 patients (32%) tumours were located just adjacent to the optic apparatus or brain stem, 27 of them (26%) were located close (<1cm) to the optic apparatus or brain stem. SRT dose and fractionation were determined according to tumor localization. Optical apparatus and brainstem maximum point dose constraints for one fraction were 10 Gy and 14 Gy; 25 Gy and 30 Gy were for 5 fractions. RESULT(S): The median age was 44 (16-81). The female to male ratio was 73/20 (3.6/1). Median follow-up was 10 months (1-37 months). The median dose was 2500cGy (1500 - 3000 cGy). The median number of fraction was5 (1-5 fractions) fraction.GTVvolume ranged between 0.66cm3and 80.6 cm3 (Median 12.4 cm3). Median conformity index was 1.4 (1.06 to 2.03) and the median homogeneity index was 1.25 (1.09 to 1.56). Among the patients with follow up, local control rate was 98%. Only one patient with parasagittal meningioma underwent decompressive surgery due to radiation induced edema. All other side effects were either grade I or II. The most common side effect was headache associated with brain edema in 10 patients (11%). CONCLUSION(S): Hypofractionated SRT is an effective treatment method in patients with cranial meningiomas with excellent rate of local control and minimal side effects."

No significant changes in levels of plasma insulin and glucose have been revealed.
3126,Excluded,"Dual-Energy CT helps in head & neck cancer treatment planning Purpose: Our previous study had demonstrated that dual energy CT (DECT) provided advantageous features in cranial target delineation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical application of DECT for treatment planning of head & neck cancer. Method(s): A Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS (Open 20RT) was used in this study for treatment planning CT simulation of all head and neck patients since January 2018. The DECT scanner allowed for sequential acquisition of two image datasets at 80 kVp and 140 kVp with the same acquisition time and radiation dose as a conventional single-energy scan. Images were reconstructed for nominal monoenergies of 40 keV, 100 keV and 190 keV, and a mixed energy of 120 kVp, which is equivalent to that currently used in routine simulation scanning. The reconstructed images were compared using the Varian VelocityAI software with a focus on the anatomical appearance of the lymph nodes and primary tumor sites. Result(s): Our data showed that there were clinically significant differences in DECT images at different nominal energies. At 40 keV, enhancement of the tumor was more clearly seen compared with CT images at 120 kVp, 100 keV and 190 keV. More significant differences were also found at the border and necrotic area of nodes using different energies. For most patients the 40 keV CT images showed more enhanced tumor areas surrounding the vessels compared with images at 120 kVp, 100 keV and 190 keV, respectively. Conclusion(s): It was demonstrated that the appearance of the head & neck primary tumor and nodes was significantly different among CT images reconstructed at different monoenergies. Quantification of such differences is in progress with corresponding MR images to evaluate clinical significance. In order to contour the gross tumor volume and nodes accurately, MR imaging is recommended."

The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases."
3042,Excluded,"Multimodal therapy for the treatment of fatigue in patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy and radiation Background: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most frequently reported symptom associated with cancer and its treatment. Unfortunately, there are limited treatment options to alleviate this distressing symptom. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and methylphenidate (that is, multimodality therapy [MMT]) can play an important role in reducing CRF. The project's objective is to explore the effects and safety of this MMT on CRF in prostate cancer patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy. We hypothesizethat the MMT is capable of reducing CRF as measured by the FACIT-F subscale in prostate cancer patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy. Specific Aims:(1) Our primary aim is to obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of various treatments (exercise, CBT, and methylphenidate) and their combinations in reducing CRF in prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, as measured by the change in patients' FACIT-F subscale scores taken at baseline and on day 57 and the secondary objective is to determine the effects of the treatments and their combinations on anxiety and depressed mood (both measured by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS]); on physical activity and function (measured by an accelerometer and a handgrip dynamometer, respectively); on levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) in serum and induced monocytes, before and after treatment Methods: For this study, we will use a randomized factorial design to assess 3 treatments (exercise, CBT, and methylphenidate) and their placebos in 8 replications. A total of 32 patients will receive each primary treatment and 32 will not. Patients will be studied for a 57-day period, during which they are scheduled undergo daily radiation treatments with androgen deprivation therapy. Fatigue, anxiety and depressed mood, and inflammatory cytokines will be determined at baseline and at 3 subsequent post-intervention assessments. After successful initiation so far 19/64 patients were enrolled. Accrual continues."

1526,Included,"Small cell bladder cancer: should we consider prophylactic cranial irradiation? PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with small cell bladder cancer at our institution, including those who received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for the prevention of intracranial recurrence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with small cell bladder cancer treated at a single institution between January 1990 and August 2015 were identified and analyzed retrospectively for demographics, tumor stage, treatment, and overall survival.RESULTS: Of 44 patients diagnosed with small cell bladder cancer, 11 (25%) had metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Treatment included systemic chemotherapy (70%), radical surgery (59%), and local radiation (39%). Six patients (14%) received PCI. Median overall survival was 10 months (IQR 4 - 41). Patients with extensive disease had worse overall survival than those with organ confined disease (8 months vs. 36 months, respectively, p = 0.04). Among those who received PCI, 33% achieved 5 - year survival.CONCLUSION: Outcomes for patients with small cell bladder cancer remain poor.

2511,Excluded,"Targeting CREB inhibits radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation and increases radiation-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a process by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) cancer cells. Accumulated evidence suggests that NED is associated with disease progression and therapy resistance in prostate cancer patients. We previously reported that by mimicking a clinical radiotherapy protocol, fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR) induces NED in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, FIR-induced NED constitutes two distinct phases: a radioresistance phase in which a fraction of cells selectively survive during the first two week irradiation, and a neuroendocrine differentiation phase in which surviving cells differentiate into NE-like cancer cells during the second two week irradiation. We have also observed increased activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein during the course of FIR-induced NED. To determine whether targeting NED can be explored as a radiosensitization approach, we employed two CREB targeting strategies, CREB knockdown and overexpression of ACREB, a dominant-negative mutant of CREB, to target both phases. Our results showed that ACREB expression increased FIR-induced cell death and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Consistent with this, knockdown of CREB also inhibited FIR-induced NED and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Molecular analysis suggests that CREB targeting primarily increases radiation-induced pre-mitotic apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting NED could be developed as a radiosensitization approach for prostate cancer radiotherapy."
2070,Excluded,"Octopamine modulates photoreceptor function in the Limulus lateral eye Activity at night in efferent nerve fibers from a central circadian clock produces changes in photoreceptor function in the lateral compound eye of Limulus: the response to light is increased; membrane potential fluctuations (bumps) occurring in the dark are suppressed; and the duration of bumps occurring both in the dark and under dim illumination is increased (Barlow et al., 1977; Kaplan & Barlow, 1980; Barlow, 1983; Barlow et al., 1985). Efferent nerve terminals release octopamine when activated (Battelle et al., 1982; Battelle & Evans, 1984, 1986); exogenous octopamine in vitro produces some of the changes resulting from efferent nerve activity in vivo (Kass et al., 1988). We report here that the increase in both on-transient and steady-state response to light induced by octopamine in the lateral eye in vitro are concentration dependent with threshold at or below 100 nM, saturation at or above 100 microM, and half-maximal increase in the range 1-10 microM. Octopamine also reduces bump activity in the dark in a concentration-dependent way. Unlike the increase in light response, the dependence of this effect on octopamine concentration is extremely variable from specimen to specimen. The effects of exogenous octopamine on light response and bump activity can sometimes be reversed by removing octopamine from the medium bathing the in vitro preparation. Octopamine also increases bump duration, apparently in a concentration-dependent manner. We have not succeeded in reversing this increase in bump duration. The concentration dependence of changes in photoreceptor response described here agrees qualitatively with the dependence of cAMP levels on octopamine in Limulus photoreceptors (Kaupp et al., 1982), lending further support to the idea that cAMP acts as a second messenger in the circadian control of photoreceptor function. Our results also suggest that the changes induced in the transient and steady-state response to light by both efferent nerve activity and exogenous octopamine have a common origin, which may differ from that responsible for the modulation of bump activity."
2040,Excluded,"Trends in radiotherapeutic management and outcomes in esophageal brain metastases Objective: To examine national practice patterns and survival outcomes in patients with brain metastases from an esophageal primary treated with intracranial radiation. Background(s): Brain metastasis from an esophageal primary are a rare occurrence, therefore clinical data regarding management and outcomes are limited. Intracranial radiotherapy in the form of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common treatment approaches in management of brain metastases, however the utilization patterns and efficacy of each technique in esophageal based brain metastasis are unknown. Design/Methods: We analyzed 289 stage IV esophageal cancer patients with documented brain metastasis treated with intracranial radiotherapy as reported by the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) between the years 2004-2014. The treatment arms included those receiving WBRT versus SRS. Univariable and multivariable analyses identified characteristics predictive of overall survival. Multivariable logistic regression identified co-variates associated with each treatment arm. Result(s): There were 230 patients in the WBRT group and 59 patients in the SRS group. With multivariable analysis, SRS receipt was an independent predictor of improved overall survival (HR=0.63, p=0.005) along with receipt of chemotherapy, lower comorbidity score, African American race, and absence of liver/bone metastases (p<0.01). Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years for the WBRT was 17% and 4% (median OS: 4.5 months) compared to 32% and 12% (median OS: 6.9 months) for the SRS arm (p=0.004). Notably, patient age, tumor grade, histology, presence of lung metastasis, and sex were not associated with differences in OS. More recent treatment year was associated with receipt of SRS (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): In the largest known analysis of intracranial radiotherapy in esophageal brain metastases to date, receipt of SRS was associated with increased OS compared to WBRT. Given the limitations of a retrospective analysis, these findings require further investigation."

Lesions were grossly visible in random areas of the brain immediately following exposure, but were not as common following a 1 h recovery period and were absent after a 2 h recovery period. The apparent route of increased permeability was via endothelial vesicular transport, since reaction product was not seen passing through the endothelial tight junctions. In addition, endothelial flooding of HRP, platelet aggregation and perivascular edema were observed only in experimental animals. Possible mechanisms of the enhanced vesicular transport are discussed."

[Russian] Wistar rats were exposed to 10, 20 and 40 sGy of gamma-irradiation. Maximal activity of 2-oxoglutarate- and succinate dehydrogenases, as well as of aspartate-2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate-2-oxoglutarate in the brain tissue was measured within 30 days after the exposure. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in the brain cortex, limbic system and in the cerebellum; transaminase activity was determined in the brain cortex, diencephalic zone and in the hypophysis. It was found that small doses of irradiation resulted in an oscillating increase of dehydrogenase activity with a decrease of the amplitude by the 30th day of the experiment. As the dose of irradiation increases, the periods of normal activity change into phases of inhibition of dehydrogenase action, the period of oscillations diminishes. Transaminase activity, as a rule, changes in a phase in a reversible manner as compared with dehydrogenase activity. These observations are discussed from the point of view of structural relations between these two systems in the intramitochondrial supramolecular structures, the so-called metabolons."

The response rates, duration of response, and toxicities are compared with those of other series of patients treated with 32P and with sequential hemibody irradiation. The response rates and duration of response are similar with both modalities ranging from 58 to 95% with a duration of 3.3 to 6 months with 32P and from 75 to 86% with a median duration of 5.5 months with hemibody irradiation. There are significant differences in the patterns of response and in the toxicities of the two treatment methods. Both methods cause significant bone marrow depression. Acute radiation syndrome, radiation pneumonitis, and alopecia are seen with sequential hemibody irradiation and not with 32P, but their incidence can be reduced by careful treatment planning. Hemibody irradiation can provide pain relief within 24 to 48 h, while 32P may produce an initial exacerbation of pain. Lower hemibody irradiation alone is less toxic than either upper hemibody irradiation or 32P treatment."

1820,Included,"Mortality among pilots and cabin crew in Greece, 1990-1997 Background. Specific health hazards, among them radiation of cosmic origin, have caused some concern among aircrew in civil aviation in recent years. Several cohort studies in Northern countries have investigated mortality and cancer incidence among aircrew. Our goal was to study the pattern of mortality among Greek commercial airline cockpit and cabin crew. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 843 Olympic Airways cockpit crew and 1835 cabin attendants. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated based on death rates of the Greek population. Duration of employment as a proxy for occupational exposure was used to stratify the cohort. Results. For cockpit crew, the overall SMR was 0.7 (n = 65, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9). The SMR for all cancers was also significantly decreased (n = 17; SMR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Most of this reduction was due to a large deficit in lung cancer deaths (SMR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). Slight but non-significant increases were noted for brain and liver cancer. The SMR for cardiovascular death was close to unity. Among female cabin attendants the SMR for all causes was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4-1.3). The SMR for all cancers was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-1.7). Mortality from breast cancer was not increased. Among male cabin crew, SMR for all causes was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Analyses according to duration of employment showed no pattern. Conclusions. In this first-ever occupational cohort study in Greece, Greek aircrew had a low overall and cancer mortality. Due to the small number of events, the strength of our study is limited. The Greek data will be included in a pooled analysis of European studies."
3168,Included,"Angiographic features, collaterals, and infarct topography of symptomatic occlusive radiation vasculopathy: a case-referent study BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes.METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation. Clinical decompensation, despite more extensive collateralization, may precipitate stroke in ORV."

2514,Included,"Targeting of externalized alphaB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction.METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy).RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mug/mL.CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces. CRYAB provides a novel radiation marker for potential vascular targeting in irradiated brain AVMs."

1077,Excluded,"Diminished capacity for p53 in mediating a radiation-induced G1 arrest in established human tumor cell lines It has been reported that the p53 gene mediates an ionizing radiation-induced G1 arrest in mammalian cells. To further characterize this important phenomenon, a panel of seven human diploid fibroblast cell strains and 14 human tumor cell lines from a variety of sources with both wild-type and mutant p53 status were assayed for their susceptibility to G1 arrest after gamma-ray irradiation by a continuous labeling [3H]thymidine incorporation technique. An irreversible G1-block involving 20-70% of the cell population was observed in diploid fibroblasts irradiated with 4 Gy. The block was abolished by transfection with the Human Papilloma Virus E6 gene and in an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, indicating a role for the AT and p53 genes respectively in this process. In contrast to wild-type normal fibroblast cell strains, the G1-block in all tumor cell lines was significantly reduced, irrespective of their p53 status. None of the nine human tumor cell lines with mutant p53 genes showed a significant G1-block following irradiation with 4 Gy. Among the five tumor cell lines expressing wild-type p53, two showed no apparent G1-block. The remaining three showed a G1-block involving only 8-15% of the cell population, a block much smaller in magnitude than that seen in diploid fibroblasts. Finally, a diploid fibroblast cell strain and a tumor cell line, both showing a normal p53 and p21/WAF1 expression pattern, were examined for pRb phosphorylation before and after irradiation. The diploid fibroblast cell strain showed a significant G1-arrest and a clear inhibition of pRb phosphorylation by irradiation whereas the tumor cells showed no G1-arrest and no inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. These results suggest that (1) multiple genetic factors may modulate the occurrence and magnitude of the G1-arrest induced by exposure to ionizing radiation, (2) the capacity for p53 to mediate a radiation-induced G1 arrest is significantly reduced in tumor cells, (3) the disruption of G1-block modulating factor(s) other than p53 may be an important step in carcinogenesis."

The outcomes of patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of toxicity, local control, and overall survival.RESULTS: Total of 97 patients were selected (56 male; 42 female) who were respectively submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A, n = 50 patients) or WBRT + SRT (Group B, n = 47 patients). Median follow-up was 95 months (range, 8-171 months). The 1-year local control rates were 46.0% and 69.0% respectively. No significant difference in local tumor control was observed between group A and B (p = 0.10). Median overall survival was 15 and 19 months in group A and B, respectively. One-year survival was 56.0% and 62%, respectively. No difference was observed in the two groups (p = 0.40).CONCLUSION: Surgery remains the main therapeutic approach in symptomatic patients; nevertheless, our data support the use of WBRT plus SRT in one or two brain metastases smaller than 3 cm."
2298,Excluded,"The radiation exposure of the patient from stable-xenon computed tomography For stable-xenon computed tomography (CT), an X-ray examination for measurement of cerebral blood circulation in the brain, the radiation exposure of the patient was determined in order to estimate the risk of inducing cancer. Organ doses of brain, eyelenses, thyroid and gonads have been calculated using the measured air kerma free-in-air on the axis of rotation and organ-specific conversion factors calculated with the Monte Carlo method. Dose measurements with TLD-100 rods using a humanoid Alderson phantom were carried out for verification of the calculated organ doses. In the case of brain partially located in the region of primary radiation a mean organ dose of 39 mSv was calculated. The dose measurements showed dose equivalents between 6 and 68 mSv in different regions of the brain and consequently an inhomogeneous dose distribution. From an estimation of the radiation-induced risk using the effective dose of 1.6 mSv it follows that one additional fatal cancer per 12,500 stable-xenon CT examinations has to be expected. The organ doses of eyelenses and thyroid located in the region of scattered radiation are so low that biological effects are hardly to be expected. The calculated dose equivalents of 6.5 mSv and 0.5 mSv, respectively, are in good agreement with measurements. The organ dose of gonads amounted to less than 0.07 mSv."

Although brain tumours have been documented and recorded since the nineteenth century, 2016 marked 90 years since Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing coined the term ""glioblastoma multiforme"". Since that time, although extensive developments in diagnosis and treatment have been made, relatively little improvement on prognosis has been achieved. The resilience of GBM thus makes treating this tumour one of the biggest challenges currently faced by neuro-oncology. Aggressive and robust development, coupled with difficulties of complete resection, drug delivery and therapeutic resistance to treatment are some of the main issues that this nemesis presents today. Current treatments are far from satisfactory with poor prognosis, and focus on palliative management rather than curative intervention. However, therapeutic research leading to developments in novel treatment stratagems show promise in combating this disease. Here we present a review on GBM, looking at the history and advances which have shaped neurosurgery over the last century that cumulate to the present day management of GBM, while also exploring future perspectives in treatment options that could lead to new treatments on the road to a cure.

Mean age of the persons was 41. Vegetative dystonia syndrome was diagnosticated in 50% of examined subjects. The increased perception and pain thresholds, as well as the thresholds' asymmetry were determined in 30% of patients. The conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerves, as well as the neuromuscular transmission were normal. No substantial changes in parameters of the soleus H- and M-responses were detected. A decreased amplitude and increased latency of the evoked skin sympathetic potential were found indicating a decreased tone of the adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstrictors and cholinergic sudomotor fibres, that may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the sensory, vegetotrophovascular disorders for these subjects. Decreased activity of the sympathetic autonomic system causes permanent course of the vegetative dystonia syndrome and more seldom the parasympathetic autonomic paroxysms. A decreased tone of the sympathetic autonomic system may be due to the monoaminergic neuromediation inhibition (decreased noradrenaline and dopamine excretion for the same subjects), that can induce psychoemotional disorders, depression and sleep-wakeness cycle disorders."

Pain induced by these treatments is frequent and varies from one treatment to another. Chemoradiotherapy induces less pain but often more severe pain, since 20% of these situations are not controlled by strong opioids. Pain from mucositis, although nonspecific to otolaryngic cancer, is more frequent and more severe, and prevention and treatment remain poorly defined. Pain from postradiotherapeutic necrosis (mandibula, laryngeal cartilage, etc.) is less frequent, delayed, and extremely severe. Cervical and shoulder pain is present in more than one-third of patients and stems from a number of mechanisms (myofascial and articulatory). It is secondary to radiotherapy or surgery (XIth cranial nerve lesions during curage or flap reconstruction). Finally, pain coexists with disturbances of basic functions (speech, swallowing, etc.) and the disability generated by treatments. Management of pain, suffering, and the psychosocial impact is essential. [References: 34]"

The ability to self-renew throughout life and the reproducible recovery after injury, make it a model tissue to study mechanisms underlying neurogenesis. In this study, X-rays were used to disrupt proliferating olfactory stem cell populations and to assess their role in the cellular and morphological changes involved in olfactory neurogenic processes.RESULTS: We have analysed the histological and functional effects of a sub-lethal dose of X-rays on the adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium at 2 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks and 5 weeks. We have shown an immediate cessation of proliferating olfactory stem cells as shown by BrdU, Ki67 and pH3 expression. At 24 hours there was an increase in the neural transcription factors Mash1 and Pax6 expression, and a disruption of the basal lamina and increase in glandular cell marker expression at 1 week post-irradiation. Coincident with these changes was an impairment of the olfactory function in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significant changes in basal cell proliferation as well as morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium following X-ray irradiation.

To date, no mechanism to explain these findings has been identified. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure. The dose-response and time-course data from the multiple animal groups tested in this study provide no evidence of magnetic-field-induced DNA damage."

Survival outcomes were retrospectively analysed in a consecutive series of 67 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients who had received either conventional fractionated photon radiotherapy (CRT) or high-dose particle radiotherapy (HDT). In the CRT protocol, a total dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy was administered. In the HDT protocol, an average dose of approximately 30 GyE in a single session and additional fractionated photon irradiation of total dose 30 Gy were administered to patients receiving boron neutron capture therapy; and a total dose of 96.6 GyE was administered to patients receiving proton therapy. Most of the patients had received chemotherapy with nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) alone or with ACNU, procarbazine and vincristine. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival times for all patients were 17.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.6-20.9 months] and 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.9 months), respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 67.2% and 33.7%, respectively. For patients treated with HDT, the median OS was 24.4 months (95% CI, 18.2-30.5 months), compared with 14.2 months (95% CI, 10.0-18.3 months) for those treated with CRT. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed radiation modality (HDT vs CRT) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis class to be the significant prognostic factors. Age, sex, pre-operative performance status, treatment with or without advanced neuroimaging, extent of surgery and regimen of chemotherapy were not statistically significant factors in predicting prognosis.

Pericardial effusions associated with sarcoidosis are uncommon (19% of cases.) Case Report: A 54-year-old lady was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of a breast biopsy in 2014 that revealed non-caseating granulomas. Since then, the patient has had chronic persistent dyspnea. Also, she has had involvement of cardiac muscle, her neurological system (unable to raise the left arm), spleen, lungs (stage 2, bilateral hilar adenopathy with infiltrates), and bony involvement of hands (arthritis and clubbing.) Often, patients with stage 2 sarcoidosis tend to go into remission spontaneously (40-70%.) In our patient's case, none of her multi-organ system manifestations abated. Up until this point, her lifelong condition has never been treated despite her symptoms because she refused corticosteroids. Superimposed on this patient were additional inflammatory diagnoses: Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, treated lyme disease, second degree heart block, spinal meningitis, tick-borne alpha 1,3 galactose allergy. When we met the patient our focus was patient-centered education. We convinced our patient to accept steroid treatment because PET-MRI imaging may now detect scar vs. inflamed, viable tissue in her ventricle with enhanced sensitivity. Discussion(s): Newer-generation PET-MRI scans have ability to differentiate scar vs. inflammatory muscle with enhanced sensitivity. This improves clinical decision-making. Only 40-50% patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are diagnosed during their lifetime. To avert missed diagnoses, the advent of improved PET-MRI allows us to detect and treat cardiac sarcoidosis. It is incumbent to treat, because, if left untreated, the risk of sudden death from cardiac sarcoidosis is as high as 85%. Recent developments in PET technology reduce radiation dose. In our patient's situation, her decision to finally initiate therapy at age 54 was based on a patient-centered, empathic, compassionate explanation of the multi-system organ nature of her disease and the advantageous properties of PET-MRI to detect a treatable cause of dyspnea."
2895,Excluded,"Performance characteristics of alcohol-mediated endovascular renal denervation BACKGROUND Efficient and safe neurolysis is key to performing a successful renal denervation procedure. Chemical neurolysis based on the perivascular infusion of alcohol via endovascular technique represents a safe and effective method which includes performance characteristics essential to the procedure. METHODS The Peregrine SystemTM Infusion Catheter contains 3 micro-needles which are deployed through the media of an artery into the adventitial region. The device is directed into the renal arteries using standard endovascular techniques. A small volume of Dehydrated Alcohol (0.3 mL-0.6 mL) when infused through the catheter, distributes circumferentially and axially along the vessel. The infusion is performed at a single site of each renal artery. Alcohol is a well-characterized neurolytic agent and functions in a consistent, dose-dependent fashion by a combination of cellular dehydration, extraction of lipids, and precipitation of proteins of target tissue. Targeted delivery of the alcohol to the perivascular space ensures that the perirenal nerves are destroyed while preserving adjacent tissue. RESULTS No procedural vascular adverse events have been reported with the use of the Peregrine Catheter. The delivery mechanisms of the device are highly flexible and atraumatic. Alcohol, as a hygroscopic agent, distributes evenly at the site of infusion. Ablation depths of up to 13 mm, as measured from the IEL, are observed. Alcohol is distributed circumferentially around the vessel (with some variation due to adjacent anatomic structures) to form a 'cuff' surrounding the artery at the infusion site. An ablation area of up to 57 mm2 have been reported based on morphometric measurements. Renal norepinephrine has been reduced by 64%-86% compared to controls. Since a single deployment and infusion is required at each renal artery, procedure time, contrast, radiation exposure are all reduced. CONCLUSION Preclinical data has shown that endovascular alcohol mediated renal denervation using the Peregrine Catheter incorporates the performance characteristics required to produce more effective neurolysis of the sympathetic perirenal nerves. On-going and completed clinical trials continue to demonstrate promising results of both safety and effectiveness."

Three-dimensional treatment planning calculations are used to compare dose distributions for several different radiation types and irradiation geometries. Calculations were performed using charged particles (H, He, C, and Ne ions) and the irradiation geometry currently used at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Photons in the Gamma Knife configuration and the Heidelberg Linac arc method are used. The 3-dimensional dose distributions were evaluated by means of dose-volume histograms and integral doses to the target volume and to normal brain. The effects of target volume, shape and location are studied. The charged particle dose distributions are more favorable than those of the photon methods.

951,Excluded,"Charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular malformations Heavy charged-particle radiation has unique physical characteristics that offer several advantages over photons and protons for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial AVMs. These include improved dose distributions with depth in tissue, small angle of lateral scattering, and sharp distal fall-off of dose in the Bragg ionization peak. Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Different types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging light-driven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse visual system."
1833,Excluded,"Survival and danger signals expression in glioblastoma cell lines: Tumour immunogenicity after radiation and chemotherapy Tumour immunogenicity is the ability of a tumour to induce an immune response that can prevent its growth. The tumour cell microenvironment, the stroma and immunity have a major role in cancer. When cells die as a result of chemoradiotherapy, the innate immune system not only alerts the adaptive immune system to potential danger, but also induces an inflammatory response. Defined proteins that appear at the surface of stressed and dying cells and are released from the cells can stimulate this immune response. The molecular mechanism accounting for the expression of immunogenic signals, in particular, in glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour, is presently under investigation. In this tumour it is necessary not only to develop a strategy to kill cancer cells efficiently, but also to attempt to stimulate an immune response to keep residual tumour under control. In our studies we investigated cell death and survival after single treatments or combination of X rays and temozolomide in glioblastoma cell lines (T98G, U87 and U251MG) and we attempted to identify danger signals, HMGB1 and HSP70, that are released by dying cells and could activate anti-tumour immunity that might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of treatments. Our results confirmed recent data showing a resistance to ionizing radiation of these cell lines. Under our experimental conditions, after a dose of 2 Gy and 10 Gy we observed a drastic increase of cell death. Our data suggested that HSP70 and HMGB1 were expressed and released in response to single or combined treatments of radiation and temozolomide, confirming a role of these proteins as signals released after radiation-induced damage in glioblastoma cells. We also could state that temozolomide had limited effectiveness in activating HMGB1 and HSP70 signalling and, instead, an adjuvant effect in their expression and release was observed in some combined treatments, but this depended on schedule, cell line and timing."
2628,Excluded,"Reactive gliosis in the adult zebrafish retina In contrast to mammals, zebrafish posses the remarkable ability to regenerate retinal neurons. Damage to the zebrafish retina induces Muller glia to act as stem cells, generating retinal progenitors for regeneration. In contrast, injury in the mammalian retina results in Muller glial reactive gliosis, a characteristic gliotic response that is normally detrimental to vision. Understanding the signaling pathways that determine how Muller glia respond to injury is a critical step toward promoting regeneration in the mammalian retina. Here we report that zebrafish Muller glia exhibit signs of reactive gliosis even under normal regenerative conditions and that cell cycle inhibition increases this response. Persistently reactive Muller glia increase their neuroprotective functions, temporarily saving photoreceptors from a cytotoxic light lesion. However, the absence of a sustained proliferation response results in a significant inhibition of retinal regeneration. Interestingly, when cell cycle inhibition is released, a partial recovery of regeneration is observed. Together, these data demonstrate that zebrafish Muller glia possess both gliotic and regenerative potential."
1299,Excluded,"Extreme retinal remodeling triggered by light damage: implications for age related macular degeneration PURPOSE: Our objective was to comprehensively assess the nature and chronology of neural remodeling in retinal degenerations triggered by light-induced retinal damage (LIRD) in adult albino rodents. Our primary hypothesis is that all complete photoreceptor degenerations devolve to extensive remodeling. An hypothesis emergent from data analysis is that the LIRD model closely mimics late-stage atrophic age relared macular degeneration (AMD).METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received intense light exposures of varied durations and survival times ranging from 0 to 240 days. Remodeling was visualized by computational molecular phenotyping (CMP) of a small molecule library: 4-aminobutyrate (gamma), arginine (R), aspartate (D), glutamate (E), glutamine (Q), glutathione (J), glycine (G), and taurine (tau). This library was augmented by probes for key proteins such as rod opsin, cone opsin and cellular retinal binding protein (CRALBP). Quantitative CMP was used to profile 160 eyes from 86 animals in over 6,000 sections.RESULTS: The onset of remodeling in LIRD retinas is rapid, with immediate signs of metabolic stress in photoreceptors, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the choriocapillaris, and Muller cells. In particular, anomalous elevated aspartate levels appear to be an early stress marker in photoreceptors. After the stress phase, LIRD progresses to focal photoreceptor degeneration within 14 days and extensive remodeling by 60 days. RPE and choriocapillaris losses parallel Muller cell distal seal formation, with progressive neuronal migration, microneuroma evolution, fluid channel formation, and slow neuronal death. The remaining retina in advanced light damage can be classified as survivor, light damage (LD), or decimated zones where massive Muller cell and neuronal emigration into the choroid leaves a retina depleted of neurons and Muller cells. These zones and their transitions closely resemble human geographic atrophy. Across these zones, Muller cells manifest extreme changes in the definitive Muller cell tauQE signature, as well as CRALBP and arginine signals.CONCLUSIONS: LIRD retinas manifest remodeling patterns of genetic retinal degeneration models, but involve no developmental complexities, and are ultimately more aggressive, devastating the remaining neural retina. The decimation of the neural retina via cell emigration through the perforated retina-choroid interface is a serious denouement. If focal remodeling in LIRD accurately profiles late stage atrophic age-related macular degenerations, it augurs poorly for simple molecular interventions. Indeed, the LIRD profile in the SD rat manifests more similarities to advanced human atrophic AMD than most genetically or immunologically induced murine models of AMD."

Volumetric assessment of the dysmorphic acardiac twin with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis (VOCAL) software is more accurate than the conventional ultrasound measurement. Twin anemia polycythemia (TAP) sequence and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) may be clinically monitored with 3DUS placental volume (PV) and power Doppler vascular indices. Congenital anomalies are more common in twins. Evaluation of fetal anomalies with 3DUS could assist perinatal management. The 3DUS power Doppler can provide a better understanding of true and false umbilical cord knots, which are commonly found in monoamniotic (MA) twins. Single demise in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies can cause severe neurologic morbidity in the surviving co-twin. Prenatal prediction of brain injury in the surviving co-twin with unremarkable neurosonographic examination is difficult. The 3DUS power Doppler may aid in prenatal detection of subtle abnormal cerebral perfusion. Prenatal assessment of conjoined twins with 3DUS is important if emergency postnatal surgical separation is anticipated. There is no significant additional advantage in using real-time 3DUS to guide prenatal interventions. Assessment of the cervix and pelvic floor during twin pregnancies is enhanced with 3DUS. Due to lack of high-quality studies, routine prenatal 3DUS in twin pregnancies needs to be balanced with risks of excessive ultrasound exposure.

LFP produced an ipsilateral lesion with cortical contusion, hemorrhage, mass shift, and neuronal cell loss (adjacent cortex and hippocampus CA-2/-3), along with contralateral neuromotor dysfunction. X-rays confirmed complete fractures in the middle of the bone shaft. The type of injury (P < 0.001) and time (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with increased IL-6 levels. CNT produced the highest IL-6 plasma levels with a maximum peak at 6 h after trauma (P < 0.001). Similarly, callus formation at fracture sites in CNT was significantly increased versus fracture only (P < 0,01). The CNT model mimics a variety of clinically relevant features known from human multiple injury, including TBI, and offers novel approaches for investigation of interactive mechanisms and therapeutic approaches."
1746,Excluded,"CT evaluation of patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding: how precisely can patients reproduce the tumor position in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices? The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reproducibility of tumor position under patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices, as well as to compare the reproducibility of deep inspiration self-breath-holding on the verbal command of a radiation technologist (Passive mode) with that initiated by patients' own estimation (Active mode). Twenty patients with lung cancer were shown how the tumor and diaphragm move during the respiration cycle. Patients were instructed to hold their breath during deep inspiration and reproduce identical tumor position as well as possible either by the Active mode or by the Passive mode. After patients had practiced self-breath-holding during deep inspiration, a set of three CT scans was obtained for each of the two modes of self-breath-holding (6 CT scans total) to obtain randomly timed images of 2 mm thickness in the vicinity of the tumor. The first three scans were performed during breath-hold using the Active mode, and next three scans were using the Passive mode. Maximum difference in tumor position for the three CT scans was then calculated along three axes: cranial-caudal (C-C); anterior-posterior (A-P); and right-left (R-L). In the 20 patients who underwent analysis of self-breath-holding, mean maximum difference in tumor position obtained under breath-hold using the Active and the Passive modes were: 2.2 and 3.1 mm along the C-C axis; 1.4 and 2.4 mm along the A-P axis; and 1.3 and 2.2 mm along the R-L axis, respectively. These differences in all axes were significantly smaller (p<0.05) for the Active mode than for the Passive mode. Most tumors displayed maximal respiratory movement along the C-C axis, and minimal movement along the R-L axis, but tumors located in the upper lung displayed maximal movement along the A-P axis. Significant correlation (p<0.05) was observed between differences along three axes in either mode of breath-hold. In conclusion, the reproducibility of tumor position under self-breath-holding by patients during deep inspiration after sufficient practice and in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices was satisfactorily accurate, and differences in tumor position were smaller under breath-holding using the Active mode than using the Passive mode. We believe this new technique is likely to prove extremely useful for the irradiation of lung tumors with a small internal margin and for reduced proportion of high-dose irradiated normal lung to total lung volume."
1866,Excluded,"Magnetic resonance imaging associates with differences in neurocognitive performance for cancer survivors complaining of cognitive deficits following brain irradiation BACKGROUND: Following brain irradiation, roughly 50% of cancer survivors develop some higher-order neurocognitive impairment that does not resolve and can decline further into dementia. However, predicting those who will develop cognitive impairment following therapy is not currently possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers from clinical scans may provide candidate biomarkers related to cognitive performance. METHOD(S): Baseline MRI scans and neurocognitive scores were collected from 198 participants enrolled in CCWFU91105 (NCT#00369785) prior to randomization. Subjects self-reported cognitive difficulties and were at least 6 months post-therapy. At minimum, a T1-weighted MRI pre- and post-gadolinium contrast was requested to confirm stable disease in all participants. Additional scans, including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and T2-weighted MRI scans, were available for analysis in subgroups of participants. Significance was assessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) with a family-wise error correction of p < 0.05. RESULT(S): Because of the vast variability in scan protocols, consistent whole-brain imaging (ie, no skip) was found in 50% of post-contrast T1-weighted scans. From these, local gray and white matter volumes were determined. Increased processing speed was associated with increased volume of white matter in the Muratoff bundle (i.e., subcallosal fasciculus), whereas increased verbal fluency was associated with increased white matter in the corpus callosum, left frontal horn, and bilateral cerebellum. Subgroup analysis of other modality scans (as available: FLAIR and diffusion-weighted) supported these findings. Perfusion of gray matter did not correlate with neurocognitive function in the sub-group receiving pulse arterial spin labeling scans. CONCLUSION(S): Variance in brain structure correlated with performance differences on several neurocognitive tests and indicated a strong association between white matter integrity and maintenance of cognitive function in cancer survivors following brain irradiation. Whether a prospective trial from a pretreatment baseline will find white matter integrity to be predictive of postradiotherapy cognitive function remains to be seen."
27,Excluded,"Potential role of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors of the maxillary sinus Purpose: To assess 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques to see whether doses to critical structures could be reduced while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage in patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus because of the risk of radiation-induced complications, particularly visual loss. Methods and Materials: Six patients who had recently received conventional RT for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus were studied. Conventional RT, 3D-CRT, and step-and-shoot IMRT plans were prepared using the same 2-field arrangement. The effect of reducing the number of segments in the IMRT beams was investigated. Result(s): 3D-CRT and IMRT reduced the brain and ipsilateral parotid gland doses compared with the conventional plans. IMRT reduced doses to both optic nerves; for the contralateral optic nerve, 15-segment IMRT plans delivered an average maximal dose of 56.4 Gy (range 53.9-59.3) compared with 65.7 Gy (range 65.3-65.9) and 64.2 Gy (range 61.4-65.6) for conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. IMRT also gave improved PTV homogeneity and improved coverage, with an average of 8.5% (range 7.0-11.7%) of the volume receiving <95% of the prescription dose (64 Gy) compared with 14.7% (range 14.1-15.9%) and 15.1% (range 14.4-16.1%) with conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Little difference was found between the 15 and 7-segment plans, but 5 segments resulted in a reduced minimal PTV dose. Conclusion(s): IMRT offers significant advantages over conventional RT and 3D-CRT techniques for treatment of maxillary sinus tumors. Good results can be obtained from 7 segments per beam without compromising the PTV coverage. This number of segments is practical for implementation in a busy RT department.

1710,Excluded,"Determining elemental tissue composition from dual energy cone-beam CT using principal component analysis and a shallow neural network Purpose: Due to the use of kV photon beams in small animal radiotherapy, the dose deposition is strongly dependent on the elemental tissue composition. We present a novel method to extract continuous elemental tissue compositions from dual energy CBCT (DE-CBCT) images. Method(s): We use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the material space. For each DE-CBCT image, we first classify individual voxels as air, soft tissue, or bone through a support vector machine. In a next step, a shallow neural network determines the weights of the principal components. All images were acquired on the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (XStrahl Ltd). The DE-CBCT imaging protocol was optimised over a range of energy and tin filter combinations. The model is calibrated on a mousesized solid water phantom with 10 tissue-equivalent material inserts with known elemental composition. We validate the model on a second phantom with 6 different tissue-equivalent inserts, and compare the predictions to a conventional PCA method with a linear regression model. We additionally apply the new method to a mouse DE-CBCT. Result(s): The material composition in the 6 inserts of the validation phantom was extracted with a mean squared error of 1%, averaged over all inserts. This is an improvement over conventional PCA methods without a neural network (3% average mean squared error), especially for bony tissues. While no ground truth is available for the mouse tissues, we found good agreement with the composition from the material database, for instance within 3% for the mouse brain. Conclusion(s): We presented a novel method to extract the elemental tissue composition from DE-CBCT images. The continuous assignment of materials is expected to reduce discretisation errors in dose calculations compared to current approaches, where only 4 to 7 materials are used."

Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs."

In addition, a focused movable laser with a diameter comparable to cell sizes is employed to select the desirable single cell for measurement under a microscope.

Features of the recorded extracellular potential firings are analyzed in frequency and time domains. We have shown that bioengineered OSNs can generate specific response signals upon the stimulation of diacetyl, which is the natural ligand of ODR-10. Moreover, different concentrations of diacetyl can elicit different temporal firing patterns in bioengineered OSNs, which permits the concentration detection of specific odorant molecules in solution."

[Russian] Short-term external gamma-irradiation (0.1-5 Gy) and long-term (30 days) internal irradiation of rats by everyday intake of 137Cs and 85Sr isotopes into their organisms induced, most probably, irreversible changes in the level of synthetic processes in the rat brain cortex neurons. Synthesis of RNA and proteins decreased significantly after 2h-long irradiation. Irradiation which lasted for 30 days has somewhat shortened the level of reparative DNA synthesis and has almost twice increased RNA synthesis. It was accompanied by changes in the relative activity of RNA-polymerases A, B and C. Doses over 1 Gy have induced an exponential delay of dose-dependent changes in the level of synthetic processes."

2610,Excluded,"Effects of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields on acetylcholine release in hippocampus of freely moving rats Some central cholinergic effects have been reported in animals after acute exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic field at low intensity. We studied acetylcholine (ACh) release in the brain of freely moving rats exposed for 1 h during the day to a 2.45 GHz continuous wave radiofrequency field (RF) (2 or 4 mW/cm(2)) or exposed for 1 or 14 h during the night to a 800 MHz field modulated at 32 Hz (AM 200 mW/cm(2)). Measurements were performed by microdialysis using a membrane implanted through the upper CA1 region of the hippocampus. After irradiation with the 2.45 GHz RF, rats exposed at 2 mW/cm(2) did not show a significant modification of Ach release, whereas those exposed at 4 mW/cm(2) showed a significant 40% decrease in mean ACh release from hippocampus. This decrease was maximal at 5 h post exposure. Exposure to the 800 MHz RF for 1 h did not cause any significant effect, but exposure for 14 hrs induced a significant 43% decrease in ACh release during the period 11 p.m.-4 a.m. compared to control rats. In the control group we observed an increase of ACh release at the beginning of the night, which was linked to the waking period of rats. This normal increase was disturbed in rats exposed overnight to the 800 MHz RF. This work indicates that neurochemical modification of the hippocampal cholinergic system can be observed during and after an exposure to low intensity RF."
511,Included,"Cranial irradiation alters dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus Therapeutic irradiation of the brain is a common treatment modality for brain tumors, but can lead to impairment of cognitive function. Dendritic spines are sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in spine structure and number are thought to represent a morphological correlate of altered brain functions associated with hippocampal dependent learning and memory. To gain some insight into the temporal and sub region specific cellular changes in the hippocampus following brain irradiation, we investigated the effects of 10 Gy cranial irradiation on dendritic spines in young adult mice. One week or 1 month post irradiation, changes in spine density and morphology in dentate gyrus (DG) granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons were quantified using Golgi staining. Our results showed that in the DG, there were significant reductions in spine density at both 1 week (11.9%) and 1 month (26.9%) after irradiation. In contrast, in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, irradiation resulted in a significant reduction (18.7%) in spine density only at 1 week post irradiation. Analysis of spine morphology showed that irradiation led to significant decreases in the proportion of mushroom spines at both time points in the DG as well as CA1 basal dendrites. The proportions of stubby spines were significantly increased in both the areas at 1 month post irradiation. Irradiation did not alter spine density in the CA1 apical dendrites, but there were significant changes in the proportion of thin and mushroom spines at both time points post irradiation. Although the mechanisms involved are not clear, these findings are the first to show that brain irradiation of young adult animals leads to alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus in a time dependent and region specific manner."

194,Included,"Does radiation exposure portend worse postoperative outcomes after cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign indications? INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative radiation exposure is traditionally thought to correlate with increased postoperative complications after cystectomy with urinary diversion (CxUD) for benign indications. We assessed postoperative outcomes among patients who received CxUD, stratified by radiation exposure. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients undergoing CxUD over a 10 year period encompassed demographics, operative parameters, 30 and 90 day readmission and complications. CxUD for malignant indications and in patients below 18 years of age were excluded. Chi-square and t-test analyses assessed demographics and indications. Complications were measured by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Among 103 patients, 39 (38%) had radiation exposure prior to CxUD. Mean age for patients with radiation exposure undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion was significantly higher (69.8 vs 59.7 years, p=0.001). In patients receiving preoperative radiation, 23.1% (9/39) had congestive heart failure (p=0.005). Other preexisting conditions such as diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, renal disease and liver disease were not associated with radiation exposure. Operative time (p=0.861), estimated blood loss (p=0.756) and length of stay (p=0.776) were not associated with radiation exposure. There was a significant correlation between radiation exposure and having a preoperative diagnosis of genitourinary fistulae (p=0.001), neurogenic bladder (p<0.0001) and urethral stricture (p=0.002). Radiation exposure did not correlate to readmission at 30 days (p=0.256) or at 90 days (p=0.576). Ureteroileal strictures requiring interventional radiology procedures were observed in 6 patients (5.8%) and stomal stenosis was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). Neither variable was correlated with radiation exposure (p=0.27 and p=0.265, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In spite of patients being older with more comorbidities at baseline, patients with preoperative radiation exposure undergoing CxUD for benign indications did not have increased readmission at 30 or 90 days or increased complications postoperatively. Additionally, operative parameters such as surgery time, estimated blood loss and length of stay were similar between radiation and naive patient groups. These findings suggest radiation exposure prior to CxUD may not portend as negative consequences as once thought."

PAsAG protected plasmid DNA from gamma-radiation induced damages under in vitro conditions. Presence of 1.6 mM PAsAG inhibited the disappearance of ccc (covalently closed circular) form of plasmid pBR322 with a dose modifying factor of 1.5. Comet assay studies on mouse spleen cells exposed to 6 Gy gamma-radiation (ex vivo) in presence and absence of PAsAG revealed that cellular DNA was effectively protected by this compound from radiation induced damages. Oral administration of 80 mg/kg body weight of PAsAG to mice 1 hour prior to 6 Gy whole body gamma-radiation exposure, efficiently protected cellular DNA in tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and blood, from radiation induced damages as indicated by alkaline comet assay. Oxidative stress in tissues such as liver and brain of mice, following whole body exposure to various doses of gamma-radiation (2-8 Gy), monitored as levels of GSH and peroxidation of lipids, were found considerably reduced when PAsAG was orally administered (80 mg/kg body weight) to the mice one hour prior to the radiation exposure. PAsAG administration improved the per cent survival of mice following exposure to 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiation.

1644,Excluded,"Uncertainty in assessment of radiation-induced diffusion index changes in individual patients The purpose of this study is to evaluate repeatability coefficients of diffusion tensor indices to assess whether longitudinal changes in diffusion indices were true changes beyond the uncertainty for individual patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT). Twenty-two patients who had low-grade or benign tumors and were treated by partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) participated in an IRB-approved MRI protocol. The diffusion tensor images in the patients were acquired pre-RT, week 3 during RT, at the end of RT, and 1, 6, and 18 months after RT. As a measure of uncertainty, repeatability coefficients (RC) of diffusion indices in the segmented cingulum, corpus callosum, and fornix were estimated by using test-retest diffusion tensor datasets from the National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) database. The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated RC from the test and retest data were used to evaluate whether the longitudinal percentage changes in diffusion indices in the segmented structures in the individual patients were beyond the uncertainty and thus could be considered as true radiation-induced changes. Diffusion indices in different white matter structures showed different uncertainty ranges. The estimated RC for fractional anisotropy (FA) ranged from 5.3% to 9.6%, for mean diffusivity (MD) from 2.2% to 6.8%, for axial diffusivity (AD) from 2.4% to 5.5%, and for radial diffusivity (RD) from 2.9% to 9.7%. Overall, 23% of the patients treated by RT had FA changes, 44% had MD changes, 50% had AD changes, and 50% had RD changes beyond the uncertainty ranges. In the fornix, 85.7% and 100% of the patients showed changes beyond the uncertainty range at 6 and 18 months after RT, demonstrating that radiation has a pronounced late effect on the fornix compared to other segmented structures. It is critical to determine reliability of a change observed in an individual patient for clinical decision making. Assessments of the repeatability and confidence interval of diffusion tensor measurements in white matter structures allow us to determine the true longitudinal change in individual patients."
903,Excluded,"Stereotactic LINAC-radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors: A long-term follow-up of 27 patients Background: The optimal treatment of glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs) remains controversial. Due to the critical location, microsurgery still provides high treatment-related morbidity and a decreased quality of life. Thus, we performed stereotactical radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of GJTs and evaluated the long-term outcome. Method(s): Between 1991 and 2011, 32 patients with GJTs underwent SRS using a linear accelerator (LINAC) either as primary or salvage therapy. Twenty-seven patients (median age 59.9 years, range 28.7-79.9 years) with a follow-up greater than five years (median 11 years, range 5.3-22.1 years) were selected for retrospective analysis. The median therapeutic single dose applied to the tumor surface was 15 Gy (range 11-20 Gy) and the median tumor volume was 9.5 ml (range 2.8-51 ml). Result(s): Following LINAC-SRS, 10 of 27 patients showed a significant improvement of their previous neurological complaints, whereas 12 patients remained unchanged. Five patients died during follow-up due to old age or other, not treatment-related reasons. MR-imaging showed a partial remission in 12 and a stable disease in 15 patients. No tumor progression was observed. The actuarial overall survival rates after five, ten and 20 years were 100%, 95.2% and 79.4%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic LINAC-Radiosurgery can achieve an excellent long-term tumor control beside a low rate of morbidity in the treatment of GJTs. It should be considered as an alternative therapy regime to surgical resection or fractionated external beam radiation either as primary, adjuvant or salvage therapy.

When comparing two models of orthotopic glioma (SF188/V+ glioma and 9L gliosarcoma) with a model of radiation necrosis in rats, we could clearly differentiate viable glioma (hyperintense) from radiation necrosis (hypointense to isointense) by APT MRI. When we irradiated rats with U87MG gliomas, the APT signals in the irradiated tumors had decreased substantially by 3 d and 6 d after radiation.

Using multivariate analysis, we established a new grading system using the six factors that were identified as indicators of longer survival: age under 60 (p = 0.001), high KPS (p = 0.007), primary tumor control (p = 0.05), low number of extracranial metastases and BM (p = 0.01 and 0.0002, respectively) and triple negative subtype (p = 0.002). Three groups with significantly different median survival times were identified: 4.1, 9.5 and 26.3 months, respectively (p < 0.0001). Our new grading system shows that prognostic indexes could be improved by using more levels of classification and confirms the strength of biological prognostic factors.

988,Included,"Use of synchrotron medical microbeam irradiation to investigate radiation-induced bystander and abscopal effects in vivo The question of whether bystander and abscopal effects are the same is unclear. Our experimental system enables us to address this question by allowing irradiated organisms to partner with unexposed individuals. Organs from both animals and appropriate sham and scatter dose controls are tested for expression of several endpoints such as calcium flux, role of 5HT, reporter assay cell death and proteomic profile. The results show that membrane related functions of calcium and 5HT are critical for true bystander effect expression. Our original inter-animal experiments used fish species whole body irradiated with low doses of X-rays, which prevented us from addressing the abscopal effect question. Data which are much more relevant in radiotherapy are now available for rats which received high dose local irradiation to the implanted right brain glioma. The data were generated using quasi-parallel microbeams at the biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France. This means we can directly compare abscopal and ""true"" bystander effects in a rodent tumour model. Analysis of right brain hemisphere, left brain and urinary bladder in the directly irradiated animals and their unirradiated partners strongly suggests that bystander effects (in partner animals) are not the same as abscopal effects (in the irradiated animal). Furthermore, the presence of a tumour in the right brain alters the magnitude of both abscopal and bystander effects in the tissues from the directly irradiated animal and in the unirradiated partners which did not contain tumours, meaning the type of signal was different."
1872,Excluded,"Implementation of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index as a quantitative evaluation tool for dose distribution error detection PURPOSE: To apply an imaging metric of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index to the radiotherapy dose verification field and evaluate its capability to reveal the different types of errors between two dose distributions.METHOD: The SSIM index consists of three sub-indices: luminance, contrast, and structure. Given two images, luminance analysis compares the local mean result, contrast analysis compares the local standard deviation, and the structure index represents the local Pearson correlation. Three test error patterns (absolute dose error, dose gradient error, and dose structure error) were designed to characterize the response of SSIM and its sub-indices and establish the correlation between the indices and different dose error types. After establishing the correlation, four radiotherapy plans (one MLC picket-fence test plan, one brain stereotactic radiotherapy plan, and two head-and-neck plans) were tested by computing each index and compared with the gamma analysis results to determine their similarities and differences.RESULTS: Among the three test error patterns, the luminance index decreased from 1 to 0.1 when the absolute dose agreement fell from 100% to 5%, the contrast index decreased from 1 to 0.36 when the dose gradient agreement fell from 100% to 10%, and the structure index decreased from 1 to 0.23 when the periodical dose pattern shifted (leading to a lower correlation). Thus, the luminance, contrast and structure index can detect the absolute dose error, gradient discrepancy, and dose structure error, respectively. For the four clinical cases, the sub-indices can reveal the type of error when gamma analysis only provided limited information.CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the subcomponents of the SSIM index and the error types of the dose distribution were established. The SSIM index provides additional error information compared to that provided by gamma analysis."
513,Excluded,"Roles of suprachiasmatic nuclei and intergeniculate leaflets in mediating the phase-shifting effects of a serotonergic agonist and their photic modulation during subjective day Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the phase adjustment of the circadian system during the subjective day in response to nonphotic stimuli. Two components of the circadian system, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (site of the circadian clock) and the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), receive serotonergic projections from the median raphe nucleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, respectively. Experiment 1, performed in golden hamsters housed in constant darkness, compared the effects of bilateral microinjections of the 5-HT1A/7 receptor agonist, 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.5 microgram in 0.2 microliter saline per side), into the IGL or the SCN during the mid-subjective day. Bilateral 8-OH-DPAT injections into either the SCN or the IGL led to significant phase advances of the circadian rhythm of wheel-running activity (p < .001). The phase advances following 8-OH-DPAT injections in the IGL were dose department (p < .001). Because a light pulse administered during the middle of the subjective day can attenuate the phase-resetting effect of a systemic injection of 8-OH-DPAT, Experiment 2 was designed to determine whether light could modulate 5-HT agonist activity at the level of the SCN and/or the IGL. Serotonergic receptor activation within the SCN, followed by a pulse of light (300 lux of white light lasting 30 min), still induced phase advances. In contrast, the effect of serotonergic stimulation within the IGL was blocked by a light pulse. These results indicate that the respective 5-HT projections to the SCN and IGL subserve different functions in the circadian responses to photic and nonphotic stimuli."
1098,Excluded,"General anaesthesia for advanced cancer patients treated with combined surgery and intraoperative precision radiation therapy Intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IORT) is widely considered to have great potential for cancer treatment. The world's first mobile electron linear accelerator (Mobetron) has changed the way cancer patients are treated.1 This study is designed to test the anaesthetic management of patients receiving a combination of extensive surgery and intraoperative radiation using the Mobetron combined with remote monitoring. Safety and effectiveness of the Mobetron will also be assessed. Our initial study was to analyse the difference between patients who underwent surgery with and without IORT using the Mobetron. A further study was designed to assess neutron leakage measurements around the target tumour bed with a semi-conducting electrode. Twenty-four patients with locally advanced primary or locally recurrent cancer were recruited into this prospective study and were randomly assigned into the Mobetron group (n=12) and the control group (n=12). General anaesthesia was delivered during surgery. Narcotrend measurements for depth of anaesthesia and noxious stimulation were made. Radiation was delivered directly to the tumour bed or target section with the use of the Mobetron immediately after surgey (resection/laparotomy). The dose rate around the target tumour bed or target section was assessed with a semi-conducting electrode. During the 2 min of intraoperative radiation therapy, patients and monitors were observed via closed-circuit camera.2 No serious complications related to anaesthesia (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, and cerebral dysfunction) occurred. The level of anaesthesia, recovery time, intraoperative haemorrhage, blood transfusion, urinary output, crystalloid and colloid infusion, lowest temperature, SpO2 (%), E'CO<inf>2</inf>, were similar in two groups. The addition of radiotherapy extends the total time of anaesthesia by 20-30 min. The dose rate at the region around target is much lower than the target (0.11 Gy min<sup>-1</sup> vs 1.17 Gy min<sup>-1</sup>). The majority of patients were stable (haemodynamic and respiratory) enough to be discharged from the ICU to the ward within 3 days. Adequate preoperative assessment and preparation, reasonable anaesthesia management with the help of adequate remote monitoring, and effective multidisciplinary (Table Presented) communication all contribute to make IORT procedures feasible and safe. IORT has allowed a selective treatment approach to locally advanced primary and recurrent neoplasm which traditionally would have been deemed unresectable. Mobetron for IORT is a safe, reliable, and easy-to-master technique without any obvious side-effect. Stray radiation from the Mobetron is so low that no additional shielding in the operating theatre is required."
1626,Excluded,"Dosimetric comparison of helical tomotherapy treatment plans for total marrow irradiation created using GPU and CPU dose calculation engines PURPOSE: To compare optimization characteristics, plan quality, and treatment delivery efficiency between total marrow irradiation (TMI) plans using the new TomoTherapy graphic processing unit (GPU) based dose engine and CPU/cluster based dose engine.METHODS: Five TMI plans created on an anthropomorphic phantom were optimized and calculated with both dose engines. The planning treatment volume (PTV) included all the bones from head to mid femur except for upper extremities. Evaluated organs at risk (OAR) consisted of lung, liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. The following treatment parameters were used to generate the TMI plans: field widths of 2.5 and 5 cm, modulation factors of 2 and 2.5, and pitch of either 0.287 or 0.43. The optimization parameters were chosen based on the PTV and OAR priorities and the plans were optimized with a fixed number of iterations. The PTV constraint was selected to ensure that at least 95% of the PTV received the prescription dose. The plans were evaluated based on D80 and D50 (dose to 80% and 50% of the OAR volume, respectively) and hotspot volumes within the PTVs. Gamma indices (GAMMA) were also used to compare planar dose distributions between the two modalities. The optimization and dose calculation times were compared between the two systems. The treatment delivery times were also evaluated.RESULTS: The results showed very good dosimetric agreement between the GPU and CPU calculated plans for any of the evaluated planning parameters indicating that both systems converge on nearly identical plans. All D80 and D50 parameters varied by less than 3% of the prescription dose with an average difference of 0.8%. A gamma analysis GAMMA(3%, 3 mm) < 1 of the GPU plan resulted in over 90% of calculated voxels satisfying GAMMA < 1 criterion as compared to baseline CPU plan. The average number of voxels meeting the GAMMA < 1 criterion for all the plans was 97%. In terms of dose optimization/calculation efficiency, there was a 20-fold reduction in planning time with the new GPU system. The average optimization/dose calculation time utilizing the traditional CPU/cluster based system was 579 vs 26.8 min for the GPU based system. There was no difference in the calculated treatment delivery time per fraction. Beam-on time varied based on field width and pitch and ranged between 15 and 28 min.CONCLUSIONS: The TomoTherapy GPU based dose engine is capable of calculating TMI treatment plans with plan quality nearly identical to plans calculated using the traditional CPU/cluster based system, while significantly reducing the time required for optimization and dose calculation."
2124,Excluded,"Structural basis of microtubule severing by the hereditary spastic paraplegia protein spastin Spastin, the most common locus for mutations in hereditary spastic paraplegias, and katanin are related microtubule-severing AAA ATPases involved in constructing neuronal and non-centrosomal microtubule arrays and in segregating chromosomes. The mechanism by which spastin and katanin break and destabilize microtubules is unknown, in part owing to the lack of structural information on these enzymes. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Drosophila spastin AAA domain and provide a model for the active spastin hexamer generated using small-angle X-ray scattering combined with atomic docking. The spastin hexamer forms a ring with a prominent central pore and six radiating arms that may dock onto the microtubule. Helices unique to the microtubule-severing AAA ATPases surround the entrances to the pore on either side of the ring, and three highly conserved loops line the pore lumen. Mutagenesis reveals essential roles for these structural elements in the severing reaction. Peptide and antibody inhibition experiments further show that spastin may dismantle microtubules by recognizing specific features in the carboxy-terminal tail of tubulin. Collectively, our data support a model in which spastin pulls the C terminus of tubulin through its central pore, generating a mechanical force that destabilizes tubulin-tubulin interactions within the microtubule lattice. Our work also provides insights into the structural defects in spastin that arise from mutations identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia patients. Â©2008 Nature Publishing Group."
1008,Excluded,"A phase II clinical study on relapsed malignant gliomas treated with electro-hyperthermia The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity and toxicity of electro-hyperthermia (ET) on relapsed malignant glioma patients. Twelve patients with histologically diagnosed malignant glioma entered the study. Eight patients had glioblastoma multiforme, two had anaplastic astrocytoma grade III and two had anaplastic oligodendroglioma. All patients were pre-treated with temozolamide-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hyperthermia with short radiofrequency waves of 13.56 MHz was applied using a capacitive coupling technique keeping the skin surface at 20 degrees C. The applied power ranged between 40-150 Watts and the calculated average equivalent temperature in the tumours was above 40 degrees C for more than 90% of the treatment duration. One complete remission and 2 partial remission were achieved, with a response rate of 25%. The median duration of response was 10 months (range 4-32). The median survival of the entire patient population was 9 months, with 25% survival rate at 1 year. ET appears to have some effectiveness in adults with relapsed malignant glioma."
1382,Included,"Effects of combined immune and radiation cancer therapy on inflammatory environment in the brain of a mouse model Purpose/Objective(s): Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These can include difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and increased anxiety. Though changes are often associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation, these effects are also seen in patients who receive peripheral but no cranial irradiation and no chemotherapy. A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance. These results will be presented at the meeting."
1989,Excluded,"Inhibition of Polo-like kinase 1 prevents the growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain Few therapeutic strategies exist for the treatment of metastatic tumor cells in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access. Thus the identification of molecular targets and accompanying BBB permeable drugs will significantly benefit brain metastasis patients. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an attractive molecular target because it is only expressed in dividing cells and its expression is upregulated in many tumors. Analysis of a publicly available database of human breast cancer metastases revealed Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in brain metastases compared to systemic metastases (P = 0.0018). The selective Plk1 inhibitor, GSK461364A, showed substantial uptake in normal rodent brain. Using a breast cancer brain metastatic xenograft model (231-BR), we tested the efficacy of GSK461364A to prevent brain metastatic colonization. When treatment was started 3 days post-injection, GSK461364A at 50 mg/kg inhibited the development of large brain metastases 62% (P = 0.0001) and prolonged survival by 17%. GSK461364A sensitized tumor cells to radiation induced cell death in vitro. Previously, it was reported that mutations in p53 might render tumor cells more sensitive to Plk1 inhibition; however, p53 mutations are uncommon in breast cancer. In a cohort of 41 primary breast tumors and matched brain metastases, p53 immunostaining was increased in 61% of metastases; 44% of which were associated with primary tumors with low p53. The data suggest that p53 overexpression occurs frequently in brain metastases and may facilitate sensitivity to Plk1 inhibition. These data indicate Plk1 may be a new druggable target for the prevention of breast cancer brain metastases."
423,Excluded,"Meditation experience predicts less negative appraisal of pain: electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of anticipatory neural responses The aim of mindfulness meditation is to develop present-focused, non-judgmental, attention. Therefore, experience in meditation should be associated with less anticipation and negative appraisal of pain. In this study we compared a group of individuals with meditation experience to a control group to test whether any differences in the affective appraisal of pain could be explained by lower anticipatory neural processing. Anticipatory and pain-evoked ERPs and reported pain unpleasantness were recorded in response to laser stimuli of matched subjective intensity between the two groups. ERP data were analysed after source estimation with LORETA. No group effects were found on the laser energies used to induce pain. More experienced meditators perceived the pain as less unpleasant relative to controls, with meditation experience correlating inversely with unpleasantness ratings. ERP source data for anticipation showed that in meditators, lower activity in midcingulate cortex relative to controls was related to the lower unpleasantness ratings, and was predicted by lifetime meditation experience. Meditators also reversed the normal positive correlation between medial prefrontal cortical activity and pain unpleasantness during anticipation. Meditation was also associated with lower activity in S2 and insula during the pain-evoked response, although the experiment could not disambiguate this activity from the preceding anticipation response. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation reduces the anticipation and negative appraisal of pain, but effects on pain-evoked activity are less clear and may originate from preceding anticipatory activity. Further work is required to directly test the causal relationship between meditation, pain anticipation, and pain experience."
1618,Included,"Glioma invasiveness responds variably to irradiation in a co-culture model PURPOSE: We developed a co-culture system to quantitate the growth and invasion of human malignant gliomas into a background of confluent normal human astrocytes, then used this assay to assess independently the effects of irradiating both cell types on glioma invasion.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled immortalized human astrocytes, human malignant glioma cells, or transformed human astrocytes were focally plated onto a confluent layer of normal human astrocytes, and the invasiveness of EGFP-labeled cells was scored after 96 h. To address the consequences of irradiation on glioma invasion, the invasiveness of irradiated glioma cell lines and irradiated astrocytic backgrounds was assessed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to quantitate the total number of EGFP-labeled cells.RESULTS: Growth in the co-culture assay consistently reflected transformation states of the plated cells. Immortalized, but untransformed human astrocytes failed even to establish growth on confluent normal human astrocytes. In contrast, all malignant human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes demonstrated various degrees of infiltration into the astrocytic bed. Irradiation failed to alter the invasiveness of U87, A172, and U373. A 1-Gy dose slightly reduced the invasiveness of U251 MG by 75% (p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Neuman-Keuls), without reducing total cell numbers. Independently irradiating the human astrocytic bed did not alter the invasiveness of nonirradiated U251, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 reduced U251 invasiveness in the co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: Growth in the co-culture assay reflects the transformation status and provides a useful in vitro model for assessing invasiveness. Human glioma invasiveness in the co-culture model responds variably to single low-dose fractions. MMP activity promotes invasiveness in the co-culture model. Reduced invasiveness in irradiated U251 appears to be mediated by MMP-independent mechanisms."

The applications are numerous, including evaluation of implanted devices and localization of cerebrovascular lesions. We present and validate the clinical utility of an alternative fast CBCT acquisition protocol in the context of neurovascular device imaging. Methods Contrast-enhanced (CE)-CBCT images were acquired using a new 10 s protocol in a phantom head model, swine model, and in patients. The acquisition parameters of both the 10 s and 20 s protocols were exactly the same, except for fewer projections (250 projections in 10 s vs 500 projections in 20 s), resulting in reduced scan time. Image quality was measured quantitatively in a controlled phantom study and qualitatively by blinded reviewers. The latter was performed to assess the image quality of the 10 s protocol pertinent to the device visibility and its apposition to the parent artery. Results 10 s CBCT images were comparable to 20 s CBCT in both phantom and animal studies. Of the 25 patient images, the reviewers agreed that they were able to discern the flow diverter struts and assess the apposition in all images. The overall rating for all 10 s images was 4.28 on a 5-point scale. No images were rated as less than 3, which was the average diagnostic quality. The ratings were concordant across three blinded reviewers (kappa =0.411). Additionally, contrast and spatial resolution between 10 s and 20 s images were similar in non-human models. Conclusions CBCT images of neurovascular devices can be obtained successfully using a 10 s acquisition protocol. In addition, the 10 s protocol offers faster acquisition, thus allowing its use in awake patients and with an added advantage of lower radiation and contrast dose.

All of the animals had the same, low-intensity-light histories, but on the day that shedding patterns were to be measured the rats were divided into three groups: one which did not have any lights turned on at 0700 hr ('contained dark' group); one which had normal, 3-lx light turned on ('colony' group); one which had a brighter-than-normal light turned on ('80-lx' group). The 'continued dark' group displayed a broad profile of shedding over time which persisted because phagosomes disappeared so slowly. The 'colony' group showed the same initial rate of phagosome production as did the 'continued dark' group but a much accelerated rate of phagosome disappearance. The '80-lx' group showed no rate of phagosome production; rather there was a simple, rapid exponential disappearance of those phagosomes which existed just prior to light onset. The kinetics of these phenomena are described in a model, rate constants for which were obtained from our data and simulated on an analog computer. The analysis of the three shedding patterns indicates the existence of an intensity-dependent disappearance rate and suggests an inhibition of shedding and/or phagocytosis by intensity greater than that of the usual environment."
869,Included,"Chromosomal in-vitro radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in radiotherapy patients and AT-homozygotes BACKGROUND: We investigated the in-vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes with a special FISH/CISS-technique.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1993 through April 1996, a total number of 52 cancer patients was enrolled in the study. The tumor sites in these patients were: breast (n = 41), lung (n = 4), head and neck (n = 3) as well as prostate, bladder, rectal cancer and Hodgkin's disease (each n = 1). Twenty-six of them were examined prior to planned radiotherapy (prospective group) and 26 after radiotherapy (retrospective group). Three additional individuals (without cancer or radiotherapy) with proven ataxia telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome, AT-homozygotes) were also investigated and their blood samples served as positive control for radiosensitivity. The clinical radiation response of normal tissue in radiotherapy patients was scored according to the WHO grading system for acute and according to the RTOG grading system for late effects. For to estimate the intrinsic radiosensitivity, blood samples were taken and irradiated in vitro with 0 (control) or 0.7 or 2 Gy with a 6 MV-linear accelerator, standard 48-hour lymphocyte cultures were prepared, chromosomes #1, #2 and #4 were simultaneously labeled with a FISH/CISS-technique and 200 to 1,000 metaphase spreads were scored for chromosomal aberrations. The radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes was expressed as the number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks per mitosis after 0.7 Gy or 2 Gy corrected for the 0-Gy control value.RESULTS: The frequency of chromosomal breaks/mitosis in the unirradiated control lymphocytes was 0.020 +/- 0.015 in prospective patients who had not yet received radiotherapy. It was significantly higher in retrospective patients (0.264 +/- 0.164 breaks/mitosis) as a result of the previous radiation exposure. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed also an increased number of spontaneous chromosomal breaks (0.084 +/- 0.016 breaks/mitosis), probably resulting from the chromosomal instability in this disease. This figure, however, was significantly lower than in retrospective patients. The number of radiation-induced breaks after in-vitro irradiation was comparable in lymphocytes of patients who showed no normal tissue reaction (n = 11) as compared to those with mild to moderate radiation reaction (n = 32, acute reactions Grade 1 to 2, late reactions Grade 0 to 2). In 9 patients with unexpected severe plus late Grade 3 to 4 reactions, however, a significantly higher number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks was measured; the highest number was observed in a patient with a radiation myelitis. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed, as expected, an extreme radiosensitivity of their lymphocytes. The number of breaks/mitosis after 0.7 Gy in vitro irradiation of lymphocytes was 0.103 +/- 0.059 in patients with no normal tissue radiation reaction (n = 11), 0.122 +/- 0.146 in the group with mild to moderate radiation reactions Grade 1 to 2 (n = 32), 0.359 + 0.226 in patients with unexpected Grade 3 to 4 normal tissue reactions (n = 9) and 0.550 +/- 0.243 in the 3 AT-homozygotes (p < 0.01, t-test). The difference in lymphocyte radiosensitivity between these 4 groups was also detected after in-vitro irradiation with 2 Gy (0.484 +/- 0.132 vs. 0.535 +/- 0.228 vs. 0.926 +/- 0.349 vs. 1.423 +/- 0.072).CONCLUSIONS: We found a significantly higher number of chromosomal breaks in lymphocytes of patients with severe or extreme radiation reaction of normal tissues as compared to patients with no or only mild to moderate radiation reactions. The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in these radiosensitive patients was in the range between normal radiosensitivity and the radiosensitivity of AT-homozygotes. Detection of patients with severely enhanced intrinsic radiosensitivity might be possible with this method."

[Russian] Effects of gamma-radiation at a dose of 3 Gy against either antiorthostatic hypodynamia (AOH) or hypokinesia (HK) on formation of the differentiated motor-drinking reflex (DR) were compared. Each of the forms of motor deprivation hindered the elaboration of DR; gamma-irradiation aggravated these disorders. At the same time, AOH led to significantly more severe disturbances in the higher nervous activity including the generalized excitation, pathologic aggressiveness and neurotization of animals. In contrast, hypokinesia stimulated the active elements of behavior which inhibit the passive-defensive behavior and a fear reaction. Therefore, the modifying effect of irradiation becomes apparent only if combined with AOH."

NFI has been successfully applied in a number of animal disease models including cancer, arthritis, and stroke. Furthermore, several applications in humans have been described. NFI is widely available in research laboratories because it has a number of advantages: It uses non-ionizing radiation and requires comparably simple, inexpensive instrumentation, and easy to handle. Fluorochromes can be detected with high sensitivity, and image acquisition time is relatively short. Furthermore, a plethora of fluorescent imaging agents is available including unspecific, target-specific, and activatable imaging probes. With these probes, biological processes such as inflammation, cell death or enzyme activity, and many others can be visualized in living animals. This review offers an overview of current approaches in NFI of stroke pathophysiology in animal models of cerebral ischemia. First, the instrumentation and the different types of imaging agents for NFI are described. Second, a short introduction to animal models of stroke is provided. Third, examples for NFI in animal models of stroke are given. Finally, the use of NFI in human stroke is critically discussed."
2364,Included,"Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ameliorates radiation-induced ototoxicity in zebrafish and cochlea-derived cell lines Radiation is a widely used treatment for head and neck cancers, and one of its most severe side effects is ototoxicity. Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts.

Objective and subjective image quality of CTP and CTA were compared. Diagnostic accuracy for detecting acute infarct and cerebral artery stenosis >= 50 % was calculated for CTP and CTA with diffusion weighted imaging and digital subtraction angiography as reference standards. Effective radiation dose was compared.RESULTS: There were no differences in any perfusion parameter value between three groups (P > 0.05). No difference was found in subjective image quality between three groups (P > 0.05). Diagnostic accuracy for detecting acute infarct and vascular stenosis showed no difference between three groups (P > 0.05). Compared with group A, radiation doses of groups B and C were decreased by 28 % and 37 % (both P < 0.001), respectively.CONCLUSION: Compared with 80 kVp protocol, 70 kVp brain CTP allows comparable vascular and perfusion assessment and lower radiation dose while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy in detecting acute infarct.KEY POINTS: * 70 kVp whole brain CTP can provide diagnostic image quality. * 70 kVp CTP diagnostic accuracy was maintained vs. 80 kVp protocol. * 70 kVp CTP radiation doses were lower than 80 kVp protocol."
2122,Included,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation."
1869,Excluded,"Recurrent breast cancer involving the brachial plexus identified by FDG PET/CT Purpose: Identifying malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in breast cancer patients is challenging from both a clinical and an imaging perspective. We evaluated the ability of PET/CT to detect malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in patients with a prior history of breast cancer. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients presenting with neuropathy and a prior history who underwent a FDG PET/CT scan from 9/01/05 to 9/01/09 was undertaken. Patients were included if the neurologic examination documented a regional pain syndrome, motor abnormalities or sensory deficits and PET/CT was ordered within 1 month of presentation. Brachial plexus involvement was confirmed by biopsy and/or resolved with cancer treatment. The location of brachial plexus involvement and other sites of disease identified on PET/CT were correlated to the pathologic results and clinical outcome. Result(s): Arm pain or peripheral neuropathy led to PT/CT evaluation in 81 patients (mean age 67.3+/-9.6) who had subsequently biopsy or clinical follow-up. FDG uptake indicative of recurrent malignancy was identified in the brachial plexus on PET/CT scans in 66 patients (81.5%). Forty-three patients had biopsy confirmation and the rest demonstrated resolution on PET/CT following treatment. The linear FDG uptake within the thicken plexus ranged from mild to intense (SUVmax= 2.1-12.3; mean 5.6). In 3 patients discontinuous plexus involvement was seen and confirmed by biopsy as skip lesions. In all but 5 patients, the brachial plexus was the only site of breast cancer recurrence identified on PET/CT. In the 15 PET/CT negative patients, 12 had positive MR. Biopsy or clinical follow-up determined that these 12 patients did not have brachial plexus disease but MR signal abnormalities were due to from post-treatment radiation or surgical changes. Conclusion(s): PET/CT readily detects breast cancer involvement in the brachial plexus in presenting with upper extremity symptoms. FDG PET/CT was able to differentiate an active tumor from post-treatment changes."

The aim of this study was to determine the responses of the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons to stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SSC). We hypothesized that direct stimulation of the SSC will inhibit the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons by activating the descending inhibitory system. Thirty-four wide dynamic range spinal dorsal horn neurons were recorded in response to graded mechanical stimulation (brush, pressure, and pinch) at their respective receptive fields while a stepwise electrical stimulation (300 Hz, 0.1 ms, at 10, 20, and 30 V) was applied in the SSC through a bipolar tungsten electrode. The responses to brush at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 16.0 +/- 2.3, 15.8 +/- 2.2, 14.6 +/- 1.8, 14.8 +/- 2.0, and 17.0 +/- 2.2 spikes/s, respectively. The responses to pressure at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 44.7 +/- 5.5, 37.0 +/- 5.6, 29.5 +/- 4.8, 31.6 +/- 5.2, and 43.2 +/- 5.7 spikes/s, respectively. The responses to pinch at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 58.1 +/- 7.0, 42.9 +/- 5.5, 34.8 +/- 3.9, 34.6 +/- 4.4, and 52.6 +/- 6.0 spikes/s, respectively. Significant decreases of the dorsal horn neuronal responses to pressure and pinch were observed during SSC stimulation. It is concluded that electrical stimulation of the SSC produces transient inhibition of the responses of spinal cord dorsal horn neurons to higher intensity mechanical stimuli without affecting innocuous stimuli."
1992,Included,"Standard radiotherapy for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma results in progressive tract-specific brain white matter alterations: A one-year follow-up via diffusion tensor imaging BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT)-induced neurocognitive disability may be mediated by brain tissue damage. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of standard RT on normal brain tissue via in vivo neuroimaging in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 146 newly diagnosed NPC patients who were treated with standard RT were longitudinally followed up at multiple time points during the first year post-RT, with 19 comparable healthy controls followed up in parallel serving as normal age-related benchmarks. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate longitudinal brain white matter tract changes in NPC patients. The relationships between RT-related white matter changes, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment were also assessed.RESULTS: Bilateral cingulate angular bundle (CAB) fibers had progressive diffusion reduction [radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity] over time (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in NPC patients during the first year after RT. RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with longitudinal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus (P = 0.033). Additionally, RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with progressive cognitive impairment in NPC patients post-RT (P = 0.048).CONCLUSION: We present evidence of progressive RT-associated changes in the bilateral CAB in NPC patients, which may underlie RT-related cognitive impairment. These findings illustrate that the use of white matter tract alterations as potential biomarkers to detect RT-related brain injury in NPC patients may be useful for better understanding the pathogenesis of RT-induced cognitive decline."
2607,Excluded,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume."
2037,Excluded,"Growth hormone deficiency amongst nasopharyngeal cancer survivors Introduction: Radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) places the pituitary particularly the somatotroph axis at risk of radiation damage. Our aim was to establish the prevalence growth hormone (GH) deficiency and other anterior pituitary dysfunction amongst NPC patients who had cranial irradiation and to determine predictive factors. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, we studied 58 patients (33 males) who had treatment for NPC more than 3 years ago and with no pre-existing hypothalamic-pituitary disorder from other causes. All patients had a complete anterior pituitary function test. Subsequently, the patients underwent dynamic testing with insulin tolerance test (ITT) to assess the somatotroph axis. Result(s): 43(75%) of patients had concurrent chemo-irradiation (CCRT) while 15 (25%) had radiotherapy alone. Median duration from therapy was 8 (3.0-33.0) years. Hypopituitarism was present in 84% of patients. GH deficiency was most common (80%) while corticotroph, gonadotroph and thyrotroph deficiencies were noted in 41,19 and 3% of the patients respectively. GH deficiency was significantly associated with duration from irradiation (9.9 years vs. 5 years, p<0.01) and the use of CCRT compared to those who had radiotherapy alone, OR: 9.5 (2.42-32.7), p<0.01. The mean peak GH response during ITT was inversely correlated with duration from irradiation (r=-0.29, p=0.04) and significantly attenuated in patients who had CCRT compared to radiotherapy alone (p=0.01 at 30 mins and p=0.02 at 60 mins). Conclusion(s): Pituitary mainly GH dysfunction post-NPC irradiation is widespread, and worsens with increasing duration from treatment and the use of CCRT. Since GH deficiency result in significant morbidity and mortality we recommend periodic assessment of pituitary/somatotroph function amongst NPC survivors."

Perineural invasion (PNI) is associated with reduced local control and survival. Methods A retrospective review of a prospective database of patients with clinical PNI from cutaneous SCC of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) between 2000 and 2011 and a minimum of 24 months follow-up. Patients were excluded if immunosuppressed, had non-SCC histology, or were treated palliatively. Results Fifty patients (mean age, 60 years) with median follow-up of 50 months were included in this study. A total of 54.8% of known primary tumors had incidental PNI. Ten percent had nodal disease at presentation. MRI neurogram was positive in 95.8%. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 5-years was 62%.

2571,Excluded,"Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm<sup>3</sup>. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small.

The application of radiotherapy is often used as palliative treatment. A review of available data from the literature reveals that irrespective of the primary diagnosis palliation is achieved in 70-100% of cases. The biological basis of pain and the effects of radiotherapy is discussed. Treatment schedules for patients with single-bone lesions are reviewed. It is concluded that single-shot treatment in doses ranging from 5 to 8 Gy is as effective as multi-fractionated treatment. In addition, the possible role of radiotherapy in relation to patients with multiple lesions, and the use of combined surgery and radiotherapy in patients with impending and manifest fractures are discussed. It is concluded that the literature does not allow a definitive conclusion concerning an optimal use of radiotherapy. [References: 41]"

Despite advances in microsurgery, tentorial meningiomas continue to challenge surgeons and patients. To evaluate the response of tentorial meningiomas, we evaluated 41 patients who had Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery during a 9 year period. Patient age varied from 32 to 79 years. Headache, trigeminal neuralgia, or facial paraesthesia were the most common presenting symptoms. Sensory deficits in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve were the most common finding. Eighteen patients (44%) had undergone between 1 and 5 (mean, 1.9) resections prior to radiosurgery; 23 had tumors diagnosed by neuroimaging. The average tumor diameter in this series was 20 mm. The maximum tumor dose varied from 24 to 40 Gy (mean, 30.5 Gy), and the tumor margin dose varied from 12 to 20 Gy (mean, 15.3 Gy). During the average follow-up interval of 3 years (range, 1-8 years), 19 patients had clinical improvement, 20 remained stable, and 2 patients deteriorated. Follow-up imaging showed a reduction in tumor size in 18 patients, no further tumor growth in 22, and an increase in tumor size in one (overall tumor control rate of 98%).

The aim of this study is to determine if the deferral of brain radiotherapy impacts patient outcomes.METHODS: Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred brain radiotherapy after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17.9 months vs 12.6 months; P=0.038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4.0 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20.0 months vs 10.7 months; P<0.01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17.9 months vs 15.2 months; P=0.289).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of deferred brain radiotherapy may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

The new advancements are mostly in modeling of operator knowledge-based behavior in accident conditions, enhancing realism of the IDAC model, and simulation approach to Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). The focus is situation assessment and diagnosis of the accident cause. Knowledge-based reasoning plays an important role in this phase. A reasoning module has been developed and implemented in ADS-IDAC to simulate operators' knowledge-based reasoning. This paper describes the cognitive architecture of the reasoning module, including knowledge representation (model of operator's understanding of the plant systems and functions), a memory representation, information processing flow, reasoning sequence generation, and rules for accident diagnosis. Some theoretical and empirical insights for human error prediction are embedded in this causal model as simulation rules. Human cognitive limitations and heuristics that potentially contribute to human errors are explicitly modeled. Together with the model description, several example simulations are provided to demonstrate different features of the reasoning module. Examples of the simulation show that the reasoning module in ADS-IDAC produces realistic knowledge-based responses by capturing cognitive limitations, deliberative reasoning, and dynamic of accident progression.

1167,Excluded,"Regulation of the DNA damage kinase ATM in the immune system ATM is the protein kinase that is mutated in the hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). A-T patients display immune deficiencies, cancer predisposition, neuronal degeneration and radiosensitivity. The molecular role of ATM is to respond to DNA double-strand breaks and alterations in chromatin structure by phosphorylating its substrates, thereby promoting repair of damage or arresting the cell cycle. ATM is activated by two known co-factors in a stimulus dependent manner. Following the induction of double-strand breaks by ionising radiation, NBS1 (mutated in Nijmegen breakage syndrome) is required for activation of ATM. ATM can also be activated in the absence of DNA damage by agents that induce changes in chromatin structure. We have recently described ATMIN, for ATM INteractor, to be required for ATM activation under these conditions. How ATM is regulated within the context of the immune system is unclear. We are using genetic mouse models to dissect the contribution of the ATM co-factors, ATMIN and NBS, to its function within the immune system. We will present data on how ATM is regulated within lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, in order to maintain a functional immune system and suppress tumorigenesis."

The authors report the first case in which robot-assisted MRI-guided LITT was used to treat radiation necrosis in the posterior fossa, specifically within the cerebellar peduncle. The use of a stereotactic robot allowed the surgeon to perform LITT using a trajectory that would be extremely difficult with conventional arc-based techniques. A 60-year-old man presented with facial weakness and brainstem symptoms consistent with radiation necrosis. He had a history of anaplastic astrocytoma that was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery 1 year prior to presentation, and he did well for 11 months until his symptoms recurred. The location and form of the lesion precluded excision but made the patient a suitable candidate for LITT. The location and configuration of the lesion required a trajectory for LITT that was too low for arc-based stereotactic navigation, and thus the ROSA robot (Medtech) was used. Using preoperative MRI acquisitions, the lesion in the posterior fossa was targeted. Bone fiducials were used to improve accuracy in registration, and the authors obtained an intraoperative CT image that was then fused with the MR image by the ROSA robot. They placed the laser applicator and then ablated the lesion under real-time MR thermometry. There were no complications, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperative 2-month MRI showed complete resolution of the lesion, and the patient had some improvement in symptoms."
2844,Included,"[Radiation treatment of metastatic tumor in the brain] Sixty-seven patients with metastatic tumor in the brain were seen from 1975 to Oct. 1985. 11 of the 22 untreated patients were followed to their death, the median survival was 2.9 months. The other 45 patients were all treated by irradiation. 40(89%) patients had bronchogenic carcinoma, three had primaries in other parts of the body and two had unknown primaries. In 16 patients, whole brain was irradiated to a dose of 1000-4000 cGy. Their 6 month survival rate was 25% but all died within one year. In 24 patients, whole brain was first irradiated to 3000-4000 cGy. Then the dose was increased to 5000-6000 cGy by cone down technique. Their 6 month survival was 75%, 1 year survival 33%. The high-dose-cone down method is obviously more effective. In the other 5 patients who were retreated locally for recurrence or new foci in the other parts of the brain, their survival was 4 to 8 months taken from the start of the second course of radiotherapy. One of these five patients is still living as of this writing. Extensive brain necrosis was observed in three patients who received whole brain radiation in the second course. Yet untoward reactions were noted in the two patients who received local irradiation in the second course. This may imply that, for the second course, only local radiation is indicated."

873,Excluded,"Control of recollection by slow gamma dominating mid-frequency gamma in hippocampus CA1 Behavior is used to assess memory and cognitive deficits in animals like Fmr1-null mice that model Fragile X Syndrome, but behavior is a proxy for unknown neural events that define cognitive variables like recollection. We identified an electrophysiological signature of recollection in mouse dorsal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampus. During a shocked-place avoidance task, slow gamma (SG) (30-50 Hz) dominates mid-frequency gamma (MG) (70-90 Hz) oscillations 2-3 s before successful avoidance, but not failures. Wild-type (WT) but not Fmr1-null mice rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdom) decrease in WT but not in cognitively inflexible Fmr1-null mice. During SGdom, putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, WT ensembles represent distant locations near the currently correct shock zone, but Fmr1-null ensembles represent the formerly correct zone. These findings indicate that recollection occurs when CA1 SG dominates MG and that accurate recollection of inappropriate memories explains Fmr1-null cognitive inflexibility."
2244,Excluded,"Reverberation challenges the temporal representation of the pitch of complex sounds Accurate neural coding of the pitch of complex sounds is an essential part of auditory scene analysis; differences in pitch help segregate concurrent sounds, while similarities in pitch can help group sounds from a common source. In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces."
1332,Excluded,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD."

The BPE intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS).RESULTS: The BTCP was triggered during the computed tomography simulation (79.3%) or treatment delivery (20.7%). Patients indicated a mean VAS of 8.8 (range 7-10) when attempting the procedure. After 4.5 min (range 2-10) of the first FPNS dose, the majority of patients (85.5%) indicated a VAS of 4.3 (range 2-6). 15.5% of the patients did not respond after 15 min; requiring a second dose. All these patients responded, reporting a mean VAS of 4.2 (range 4-6) after 3.0 min (range 2-5) of the second dose. None of the patients required a third dose, nor reported an AE after the administration of FPNS.CONCLUSIONS: In our knowledge, our study is the one of highest recruitment, and with the fastest response of BTCP treated with FPNS reported in advanced cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. FPNS has proven to be highly effective in reducing the intensity of procedural BTCP in a very short period of time."

It does not entail exposure to radioactivity and has other important technical advantages over previously available methods for mapping functional neuroanatomy, such as positron emission tomography. It is likely that fMRI will become an increasingly important and widely used technique for psychiatric research in the next 5 years; applications to clinical practice are also conceivable. Here we review the technical foundations of fMRI. We begin with a brief summary of the basic physical principles of magnetization and nuclear magnetic resonance. This is followed by a description of some commonly used procedures for magnetic resonance imaging in general; an introduction to exogenous and endogenous contrast agents; and a section on gradient echo echoplanar imaging for fMRI specifically. We describe common artefacts and essential hardware requirements. Then issues of experimental design and data analysis are discussed in conclusion. Given the rapid rate of scientific progress in this field, this review can be no more than introductory.

2445,Excluded,"1MBq/kg may be sufficient for brain F18-FDG PET in integrated PET/MR system Objectives: Integrated PET/MR offers multiple advantages for brain examinations, regards to superior soft-tissue contrast of MRI compared to CT, but also because of the substantial reduction in patient ionizing radiation exposure due to the absence of CT scan. 2 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG are usually administered for brain PET/CT in clinical settings. Taking into account the high sensitivity of PET/MR systems with time-of-flight capability and, considering that a 20-30 min MR acquisition time is usually mandatory in neurological indications, we assume that the administered dose could be significantly decreased in brain PET/MR examination without degrading qualitative and quantitative characteristics of 18F-FDG PET images. Method(s): A retrospective single-institution study was performed on 100 patients (mean age 66.9 +/- 10.5 years, 51 men, 49 females) explored for cognitive impairment or suspicion of neurodegenerative disease, between March 2016 and May 2016. Simultaneous brain 18F-FDG-PET/MR was acquired with the SIGNA PET/MR system (GE Healthcare) for 30 min, 30-60 min after tracer injection (18F-FDG, 2MBq/kg), including a 20 min single-bed-position PET emission scan. In each patient, list-mode acquisition was reconstructed to generate two sets of PET images: a 20-minute summation image used in clinical routine (PET<inf>20min</inf>), and a ten-minute summation image (PET<inf>10min</inf>) to simulate a low-dose injection by reducing the amount of collected data. Two independent nuclear physicians were asked to classify brain metabolic pattern into 6 diagnostic classes: Alzheimer's disease (AD), logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), semantic dementia (SD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), normal or non-evaluable (NE). The first set of 100 images (PET<inf>20min</inf>) was analyzed once and, the second one (PET<inf>10min</inf>) 2-3 months later. Regional SUV ratios were extracted with CortexID Suite (GE Healthcare) from PET<inf>20min</inf> (SUV<inf>20min</inf>) and PET<inf>10min</inf> (SUV<inf>10min</inf>) images and compared pairwise. Intraclass correlation coefficient was measured. Bland-Altman graphical analyses were also conducted. Result(s): Brain metabolism was suggestive of AD in 37% patients, LPA (3%), SD (12%), FTD (10%). It was classified as normal in 37% and NE in only one case. Very good agreement (kappa=0.951) was found between PET<inf>20min</inf> and PET<inf>10min</inf> visual assessments for both readers. Regional SUV<inf>20min</inf> and SUV<inf>10min</inf> were strongly correlated (r = 0.988). Differences between SUV<inf>20min</inf> and SUV<inf>10min</inf> ranged from-0.19 to 0.14 (median-0.01; 95% limits of agreement:-0.08 to 0.08). Such differences were too mild to modify the interpretation of brain PET metabolism in clinical settings. Conclusion(s): 50% dose reduction of 18F-FDG could be performed for brain PET/MR imaging without modifying diagnostic performances and PET/MR examination duration. A dose of 1 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG may be sufficient for rEliable measurements of regional SUV ratios in brain PET. The low-dose protocol will lead to a major reduction in patient ionizing radiation exposure (effective dose: 1.42 mSv for a 75kg subject) and could be useful in research studies requiring serial PET in healthy controls."

Galactic cosmic rays are composed of protons, alpha particles, and particles of high energy and charge (HZE particles). Research by our group has shown that exposure to HZE particles, primarily 600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n 56Fe, can produce significant alterations in brain neurochemistry and behavior. However, given that protons can make up a significant portion of the radiation spectrum, it is important to study their effects on neural functioning and on related performance. Therefore, these studies examined the effects of exposure to proton irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints, including dopaminergic functioning, amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion learning, and spatial learning and memory as measured by the Morris water maze. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a dose of 0, 1.5, 3.0 or 4.0 Gy of 250 MeV protons at Loma Linda University and were tested in the different behavioral tests at various times following exposure. Results showed that there was no effect of proton irradiation at any dose on any of the endpoints measured. Therefore, there is a contrast between the insignificant effects of high dose proton exposure and the dramatic effectiveness of low dose (<0.1 Gy) exposures to 56Fe particles on both neurochemical and behavioral endpoints."

The measurements were made in a geometry used for irradiation of intracranial lesions. For radii less than 1.0 cm the dose on the central axis is progressively reduced due to electron disequilibrium. This leads to measurement artifacts when the detector is too large, as was readily observed with ionization chambers. Radiographic and radiochromic films were used with densitometric evaluation to provide the resolution necessary to measure absorbed doses for the narrowest beams. The contribution by phantom-scattered photons is significant even at small field sizes, and scatter factors were determined from the experimental results. Photons scattered by the auxiliary collimator did not add appreciably to the dose on the central axis. The data were used to characterize the dose-to-kerma ratio as a function of beam radius. Differences between experimental results and those from Monte Carlo calculations were observed."
1455,Included,"Radiation Induces Distinct Changes in Defined Subpopulations of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells in the Adult Hippocampus While irradiation can effectively treat brain tumors, this therapy also causes cognitive impairments, some of which may stem from the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. To study how radiation affects neurogenesis, we combine phenotyping of subpopulations of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells with double- and triple S-phase labeling paradigms. Using this approach, we reveal new features of division, survival, and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells after exposure to gamma radiation. We show that dividing neural stem cells, while susceptible to damage induced by gamma rays, are less vulnerable than their rapidly amplifying progeny. We also show that dividing stem and progenitor cells that survive irradiation are suppressed in their ability to replicate 0.5-1 day after the radiation exposure. Suppression of division is also observed for cells that entered the cell cycle after irradiation or were not in the S phase at the time of exposure. Determining the longer term effects of irradiation, we found that 2 months after exposure, radiation-induced suppression of division is partially relieved for both stem and progenitor cells, without evidence for compensatory symmetric divisions as a means to restore the normal level of neurogenesis. By that time, most mature young neurons, born 2-4 weeks after the irradiation, still bear the consequences of radiation exposure, unlike younger neurons undergoing early stages of differentiation without overt signs of deficient maturation. Later, 6 months after an exposure to 5 Gy, cell proliferation and neurogenesis are further impaired, though neural stem cells are still available in the niche, and their pool is preserved. Our results indicate that various subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus have different susceptibility to gamma radiation, and that neurogenesis, even after a temporary restoration, is impaired in the long term after exposure to gamma rays. Our study provides a framework for investigating critical issues of neural stem cell maintenance, aging, interaction with their microenvironment, and post-irradiation therapy."

In the central nervous system, radiation combined injury (RCI) involving irradiation and traumatic brain injury may have a multifaceted character. This may entail cellular and molecular changes that are associated with cognitive performance, including changes in neurogenesis and the expression of the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Because traumatic stimuli initiate a characteristic early increase in polyamine metabolism, we hypothesized that treatment with the polyamine inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) would reduce the adverse effects of single or combined injury on hippocampus structure and function. Hippocampal dependent cognitive impairments were quantified with the Morris water maze and showed that DFMO effectively reversed cognitive impairments after all injuries, particularly traumatic brain injury. Similar results were seen with respect to the expression of Arc protein, but not neurogenesis. Given that polyamines have been found to modulate inflammatory responses in the brain we also assessed the numbers of total and newly born activated microglia, and found reduced numbers of newly born cells. While the mechanisms responsible for the improvement in cognition after DFMO treatment are not yet clear, the present study provides new and compelling data regarding the potential use of DFMO as a potential countermeasure against the adverse effects of single or combined injury."

Primary goals of treatment include normalization of hormonal level and improving visual or neurological symptoms. Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma. More aggressive multimodal approach and incorporation of new radiation technique may help to achieve better clinical outcome."

The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers.

575,Included,"Cellular Senescence in Mouse Hippocampus After Irradiation and the Role of p53 and p21 Diverse stress signals including irradiation may trigger cellular senescence. We asked whether irradiation induced senescence in mouse hippocampus, and whether p53 or p21 played a role in this response. Following whole-brain irradiation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays for senescence-associated genes showed increased expression of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p19ARF) in mouse hippocampus at 9 weeks. Upregulation of p21 and p19ARF was confirmed using real-time PCR, which also demonstrated increased CDKN2A/p16INKa expression after irradiation. No altered regulation of another 17 senescence-associated genes was observed after irradiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased nuclear expression of p16INK4A, p19ARF, p53, p21, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and interleukin-6 (IL6) in granule cells of dentate gyrus after irradiation. Increased p16 nuclear immunoreactivity was further observed in type -1 cells, the putative neural stem cells. gamma-phosphorylated-histone-2A nuclear foci were also seen in dentate gyrus 9 weeks postirradiation. In nonirradiated mice knockout of the TRP53 or p21 gene, there was increased p16INK4A, p19ARF, and IL6, but not pp38 in dentate gyrus. We conclude that irradiation induces transcript and protein expression profile alterations in mouse dentate gyrus consistent with the senescence phenotype. Absence of p53 or p21 results in increase in baseline expression of senescence markers with no further increase in expression after irradiation."

With a strong conviction that additional tool that improve mAb penetration and diffusion in dense fibroblastic solid cancer should indispensable for better therapeutic effect, we focused and employed the simple but strongest modalities, heat. Heat might increase tumor blood flow and tumor vessel permeability, leading enhanced accumulation of anticancer mAb. In this study, we aimed the increased accumulation of mAb in mouse pancreatic subcutaneous models and also boosted antitumor effects by applying moderate heat. Method(s): Heat generation was completed by hot bathtub method for subcutaneous tumor in nude mice leg. Three human pancreatic cell of different stromal amount were employed (abundant: Capan-1, moderate: BxPC-3, and scant: MIAPaCa-2). At the timing of each tumors growth up to 70mm<sup>3</sup>, Cetuximab (1 mg/kg) was systematically administrated via caudal vein, subsequently applying heat to tumors for 30 min at three different temperatures of 25degreeC (control temperature), 37degreeC (intraabdominal organs), or 41degreeC (hyperthermia) (n = 5 each). The amount of accumulated Cetuximab were quantified by the fluorescent intensity of Alexa 488 against anti-human IgG at 24 hr, followed by figuring up the intensity of one cancer cell by dividing the total intensity value by the number of a cancer cell nuclei stained with DAPI. Enhanced antitumor effects, among irradiating various heat doses, were evaluated by the tumor volume over time. Result(s): In Capan-1, the fluorescent intensity per a cancer cell at 25degreeC, 37degreeC, 41degreeC were 675, 1130, 2332 respectively. Similarly, those in BxPC-3 were 673, 1347, 1573, and in MIAPaCa-2 were 1632, 1921, 1949, respectively. In Capan-1 and BxPC-3, the mean tumor growth on day 40 were significantly inhibited at 37degreeC group (934, 189 mm<sup>3</sup>), and 41degreeC group (491, 121 mm<sup>3</sup>) in compared with 25degreeC group (1385, 470 mm<sup>3</sup>) respectively.

Intending to provide more add-on effect, we are now evaluating the combined effects of hyperthermia plus applying a cyclic tumor-penetrating peptide (iRGD), which improved anticancer mAb penetration to cancer cells by binding to integrin alphav/beta3 or beta5 and to neuropillin-1 on cancer cells. We suggested that this novel combined strategy would remarkably contribute to the enhanced accumulation of anticancer mAb in tumors and to the enhanced antitumor effects."

Overall prognosis, diagnosis and management of PCNSL differ from other types of NHL. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment are vital to improving clinical outcomes. PCNSL is responsive to radiation therapy, however whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) inadequately controls the disease when used alone and its delayed neurotoxicity causes neurocognitive impairment, especially in elderly patients. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based induction chemotherapy with or without autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or reduced-dose WBRT leads to durable disease control and less neurotoxicity. The optimal treatment has yet to be defined, however HD-MTX-based induction chemotherapy is considered standard for newly diagnosed PCNSL. Ongoing randomized trials address the role of rituximab, and of consolidative treatment using ASCT or reduced-dose WBRT. Despite high tumor response rates to initial treatment, many patients have relapsing disease with very poor prognosis. The optimal treatment for refractory or relapsed PCNSL is poorly defined. The choice of salvage treatment depends on age, previous treatment and response, performance status and comorbidities at the time of relapse. Novel therapeutics targeting underlying tumor biology include small molecule inhibitors of B-cell receptor, cereblon, and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, and immunotherapy programmed cell death 1 receptor inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells.

In borderline resectable disease, there is a lack of data to support an optimal neoadjuvant approach for curative outcomes. We describe our institutional experience with a multimodality approach. Method(s): We identified all patients with borderline resectable PNET, using NCCN criteria for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, who received neoadjuvant therapy at our institution between 2000 and 2013. The reason for borderline status was noted. Neoadjuvant regimen, radiographic response, pathologic response, surgical margins, nodal harvest, number of positive nodes, and recurrence were all documented. Result(s): A total of 112 patients had undergone pancreatic resections for neuroendocrine tumors during the study period. Six patients had borderline resectable disease. The mean age was 55 years (24-70). They all received at least 1 cycle of Temodar and Xeloda. Three of the six patients also received concurrent 5-FU and radiation. There was radiographic evidence of treatment response in all patients. Five of six patients (83 %) had negative margin (R0) resection. Low volume miliary metastatic disease in the liver was detected in 1 patient at the time of surgery. The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 12. Half of the patients had node positive disease.

The patient with metastatic disease has had no progression and is the only one who is currently receiving any form of treatment. Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant Temodar and Xeloda +/- radiation with 5-FU sensitization can lead to R0 resection with durable response in patients with borderline resectable PNET. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of multimodality therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- chemoradiation and surgery) in the treatment of borderline resectable PNET."

This work develops and investigates a comprehensive formalism for accurate motion-compensated reconstruction which at the same time is very feasible in the context of high-resolution PET. In particular, this paper proposes an effective method to incorporate presence of scattered and random coincidences in the context of motion (which is similarly applicable to various other motion correction schemes). The overall reconstruction framework takes into consideration missing projection data which are not detected due to motion, and additionally, incorporates information from all detected events, including those which fall outside the field-of-view following motion correction. The proposed approach has been extensively validated using phantom experiments as well as realistic simulations of a new mathematical brain phantom developed in this work, and the results for a dynamic patient study are also presented."
2283,Excluded,"Epidemiology and molecular pathology of glioma Gliomas account for almost 80% of primary malignant brain tumors, and they result in more years of life lost than do any other tumors. Glioblastoma, the most common type of glioma, is associated with very poor survival, so glioma epidemiology has focused on identifying factors that can be modified to prevent this disease. Only two relatively rare factors have so far been conclusively shown to affect glioma risk--exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, and inherited mutations of highly penetrant genes associated with rare syndromes. In addition, preliminary evidence points to a lower glioma risk among people with allergic conditions and high levels of serum IgE. Recent research has focused on identifying germline polymorphisms associated with risk of glioma, and using molecular markers to classify glial tumors into more-homogenous groups. Because gene products probably interact with environmental factors or developmental signals to produce gliomas, large studies are needed to analyze associations between polymorphisms and glioma. Cohort studies of immune factors and glioma risk are being undertaken to validate the results of case-control studies. Studies of polymorphisms of genetic pathways with strong prior hypotheses are being planned, and whole-genome scans are being proposed to study high-risk families and case-control series. The Brain Tumor Epidemiology Consortium has been formed to co-ordinate these studies. [References: 69]"

After pargyline administration, pineal 5-methoxytryptamine and melatonin were measured by HPLC in male golden hamsters kept under short and long photoperiod. In both photoperiodic regimes, a clear 5-MT rhythm was observed which fitted a sinusoidal function with high values occurring during the daytime and low values occurring during the night-time. The duration of the low night-time levels was clearly proportional to the length of the dark phase. A marked rhythm of melatonin synthesis was also seen with low daytime levels and high night-time values. An inverse relationship between 5-MT and melatonin levels was observed. Thus, after pargyline administration, the rhythms of 5-MT and melatonin in the pineal gland of golden hamsters are photoperiod-dependent and show a reciprocal relationship."
2232,Excluded,"Bevacizumab, temozolomide, and radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma: comprehensive safety results during and after first-line therapy BACKGROUND: The proposed use of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma raised potential safety concerns. Bevacizumab has been linked with stroke, bleeding events, and wound-healing complications in other tumor types; these events are of particular concern for glioblastoma (highly vascular tumors that are usually resected). Published data on the interaction of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide are also limited. We report safety data from a phase III randomized trial (Avastin in Glioblastoma), focusing on these considerations.METHODS: Eligible patients received: radiotherapy and temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; a 4-week treatment break; temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; and bevacizumab/placebo until progression. Data on adverse events (AEs) were collected throughout.RESULTS: Bevacizumab-treated patients (n = 461) had a longer median safety follow-up time (12.3 vs 8.5 mo), and a higher proportion completed 6 cycles of maintenance temozolomide (64.6% vs 36.9%) versus placebo (n = 450). The incidences of relevant AEs (bevacizumab vs placebo, respectively) were: arterial thromboembolic events (5.9% vs 1.6%); cerebral hemorrhage (3.3% vs 2.0%); wound-healing complications (6.9% vs 4.7%); thrombocytopenia (34.1% vs 27.3%); radiotherapy-associated skin injury (8.2% vs 9.3%); alopecia (39.0% vs 36.0%); gastrointestinal perforation (including gastrointestinal abscesses and fistulae, 1.7% vs 0.4%); and radiotherapy-associated injury (0.4% vs 0.0%). Overall, 15.8% and 23.8% of bevacizumab- and placebo-treated patients had surgery (including biopsy) after progression. Within 30 days of postprogression surgery, AE incidence was 10.9% (bevacizumab) and 23.4% (placebo).CONCLUSION: The safety profile was consistent with that expected from radiotherapy/temozolomide plus bevacizumab. The increased AE incidence with bevacizumab did not impact patients' ability to receive standard-of-care treatment or to undergo further surgery."
1749,Excluded,"Ultrasound assessment of atheromatous changes in the vertebral and common carotid artery in patients after radiation due to breast cancer Introduction. Early diagnosis and modern radiotherapy have helped to significantly improve the prognosis in breast cancer, decrease mortality and increase the frequency of vascular complications connected with the treatment. The increase in the risk of vascular complications may be caused by inflammatory and atheromatous changes in the coronary and carotid arteries provoked by ionizing radiation. It has been proved that the risk of stroke in a long-term observation of patients who have completed the treatment (average observation time 4.5 years) is significantly higher than in non-treated patients. On the basis of the above information, one can suppose that the factor responsible for acute brain incident, such as stroke, in patients after radiotherapy due to breast cancer, as in patients irradiated because of head and neck cancers, is hemodynamically significant radiation-induced narrowing of the vessels. Objectives. Ultrasound assessment of vessel walls and Doppler measurement of blood flow parameters in the radiated arteries in the supraclavicular area (the first part of the common carotid artery, vertebral artery) as well as determination of a difference in the assessed parameters of the wall morphology and blood flow waveform between the side treated with radiotherapy and the non-treated side. The third aim was the assessment of the dynamics of atheromatous changes over time after finishing radiotherapy. Material and method. A group of 41 patients treated at the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland were observed from the year 2003 to 2014. The average age of the patients was 60. The dose in the supraclavicular area was identical for all patients and amounted to 50.0 Gy. The average time after the treatment ended was 54 months. The assessment of vessels concerned both common carotid arteries (CCA), the division of the common carotid arteries, the initial internal carotid arteries (ICA) including the measurement of the internal and medial membrane (Intima-Media Thickness - IMT) in the proximal segment of the CCA and the vertebral arteries with particular regard to their proximal segment. Results. The average IMT on the radiated side was 0.68 +/- 0.11 mm, and on the opposite side - 0.62 +/- 0.09 mm. On the basis of the statistical analysis of the differences between average IMT on the radiated side (IMT-RT) and IMT of the non-radiated side (IMT NRT), it has been confirmed that it is statistically significant (p = (0,044) for the assumed relevance level of p = 0.05. When analyzing the change of IMT over the time that passed from the conclusion of treatment, it was found that it had no important influence on the increase in the internal membrane thickness. In the second stage of the research, it was attempted to assess the proximal segment of the vertebral artery and indirectly the subclavian artery using B-duplex ultrasonography. The results show that narrowing is more common on the radiated side. In one case, narrowing of the vertebral artery and its thickening throughout all the observed segment from V0 to V2 were observed, which suggests inflammatory lesions caused by radiation in all three arterial walls. Conclusions. Radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer involving the supraclavicular arteries causes an increase in internal membrane thickness in the common carotid arteries. Radiation of this area increases the frequency of vertebral artery narrowing in the proximal segment. Copyright Â© ONKOLOGIA I RADIOTERAPIA 2015."

Seventy-six SD rats six weeks old were divided into control group (4 animals) and experimental groups (18 different subgroups) with 4 animals for each group. Healthy SD rats were exposed to the 460-480 nm blue light for 3 or 12 hours on three different irradiance of 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) respectively. After recovery in darkness for 4 hours, 24 hours or 3 days, retinal tissue was collected after the eyes were enucleated. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate the general anatomical changes of the rat retinal layers. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling was performed to detect apoptotic cells and immunofluorescence staining was conducted to illustrate the expression and location of related proteins in Muller cells. The number of ganglion cells was analyzed by one-way ANOVA.RESULTS: No injury was observed in SD rat retina at the irradiance of 0.6 W/m(2). Retinal cells were damaged with irradiance at 10.0 W/m(2), which mainly affected photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells, while Muller cells of retinal inner nuclear layer were also involved. Apoptosis began after 4 hours of exposure and peaked at 24 hours. Moderate damage of retina was observed at the irradiance of 1.5 W/m(2) after 12 hours rather than 3 hours exposure. The number of ganglion cells was significantly different among the different groups 3 days after exposure. When the exposure time was 3 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.58 +/- 0.50, 40.92 +/- 0.32 and 22.83 +/- 0.79 (F = 1305.86, P = 0.000). When the exposure time was 12 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.83 +/- 0.69, 41.08 +/- 0.17 and 22.75 +/- 0.83 (F = 1095.78, P = 0.000). The number of retinal ganglion cells showed significant decrease 3 days after exposure at the irradiance 10.0 W/m(2) (exposure time 3 h:t = 52.32, P = 0.000; exposure time 12 h:t = 47.58, P = 0.000).CONCLUSIONS: The safe exposure time to SD rat retina layers is 12 hours for the blue light with wavelength 460-480 nm at the irradiance 0.6 W/m(2). And the safe exposure time descends to 3 hours at the irradiance 1.5 W/m(2)."

Biopsy confirmed cerebral radiation necrosis. The radiation dose was 25 Gray to the periphery of two overlapping 14 mm collimator fields, delivered in a single dose. Treatment with steroids led to improvement in the symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure, but not the focal deficit.

Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere."
2532,Excluded,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT INTRODUCTION: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor onco-genetics. We aimed to determine whether the RTOGRPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment paradigm, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. METHOD(S): Patients with histologically-proven high-grade gliomas treated with IMRT between 2004-2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pre-treatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. RESULT(S): We identified 878 patients with a median overall survival of 14.2 months (95% CI: 13.1-15.3). Our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the RTOG RPA survival classes except class II. Our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (p2 = 584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, MGMT methylation, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide, and resection. Our second RPA of our genetic subset (291 patients) generated 5 significantly different survival classes (p2 = 166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, IDH1 mutation, MGMT methylation, neurologic functional classification, IMRT hospitalization, temozolomide, and KPS. CONCLUSION(S): This series represents a large RPA analyzing clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These classifications need to be validated by a prospective dataset and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine if they provide improved prognostic power."

Grids of thermoluminescence dosemeters were attached on the head of the patient. The exposure parameters of the X-ray systems and the clinical procedures were fully documented. While for the diagnostic procedure, the dose threshold of 2 Gy for deterministic effects was not reached, this situation was much different for the embolisations. For angiography of the carotid arteries, no skin doses were measured >320 mGy. For the cerebral embolisations, maximum skin doses up to 5.4 Gy were measured. Doses to the patients varied largely between different hospitals and within the same hospital for similar procedures. On the one hand, the complexity of the pathology for interventional procedures was responsible for the large variability in dose. On the other hand, large differences in clinical protocol and technical parameters of the X-ray systems, explaining the dose variations, were also observed. A correlation was found between the maximum skin dose measured on a patient and the total dose-area product (DAP) value for cerebral embolisations. This correlation makes it possible to estimate the maximum skin dose from these DAP values and to determine a trigger level. In conclusion, management of patient doses in interventional radiology requires training, specialisation and well-documented procedure guidelines."

This case is well reproduced by ex-vivo samples of 90<sup>Y</sup>-marked Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP NET) in the bowel. These specimens indeed include at least three wide independent sources of background associated to three anatomical districts (mesentery, intestine, mucose). The study is based on the analysis of 37 lesions found on 5 samples belonging to 5 different patients. We show that the use of electrons, a short range particle, instead of gamma particles, allows to limit counts read on a lesion to the sum of the tumor signal plus the background generated by the sole hosting district. The background on adjacent districts in the same specimen/patient is found to differ up to a factor 4, showing how the specificity and sensitivity of the beta<sup>-</sup>-RGS technique can be fully exploited only upon a correct measurement of the contributing background. This locality has been used to set a site-specific cut-off algorithm to discriminate tumor and healthy tissue with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity, on this test data sample, close to 100%.

However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT <inf>non-RE</inf> (n = 21) and post-RT <inf>REproved</inf><inf>infollow-up</inf> (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE.

Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output."

Conversely, the delivery of two doses with the same delay prior to and after exposure led to a complete prevention of vomiting and retching. These observations can be explained by the dual mechanism of radiation-induced emesis: an early peripheral mechanism and a later central mechanism. Two deliveries of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists seem to disrupt serotonergic transmission at the brain stem structures and to affect the peripheral release of serotonin from the gut, thus completely preventing radiation-induced vomiting.

However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response. These beneficial effects were maintained and the BMC also increased in both groups by the second year of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that prior irradiation for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma does not compromise the beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy."

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy."
1207,Included,"Divergent effects of irradiation on brain cortical morphology in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: one-year follow-up study using structural magnetic resonance imaging Background: Increasing evidence indicates that radiotherapy (RT)-induced brain cortical deficits may play a critical role in developing radiation encephalopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the evolutional processes of RT-induced cortical injury have not been sufficiently investigated. This study investigates RT-induced effects on cortical morphology using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPC patients.Methods: Using MRI-based morphometry with surface-based measures, we evaluated the longitudinal alterations of cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 104 NPC patients at pre-RT (n=104), within 3 months post-RT (n=92), 6 months post-RT (n=71), and 9-12 months post-RT (n=52). Twenty healthy controls were also evaluated in parallel. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies."
2523,Excluded,"Subthalamic nucleus stimulation for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia With the renaissance of stereotactic pallidotomy for Parkinson's disease in 1990s, pallidotomy has become increasingly used as an effective treatment for various manifestations of medically refractory dystonia. More recently, deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been replacing pallidotomy. Although GPi DBS has great promise for treating dystonia, there are some disadvantages. We introduce our experiences in subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia in this chapter. We propose that STN DBS has the following advantages over GPi DBS: (1) symptomatic improvement is seen immediately after stimulation, allowing us to quickly select the most suitable stimulation parameters; (2) the stimulation parameters for the STN are lower than those used for the GPi, resulting in longer battery life; and (3) STN DBS results in better symptomatic control than GPi DBS in dystonia patients when our STN data is compared to that obtained by others with using the GPi as the target. We suggest that STN DBS may be the most appropriate surgical technique for dystonia. [References: 50]"

This study included participants in the Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study who have been followed up by biennial health examinations since 1958. We calculated the LTR of stroke for various BP-based groups among 7847 subjects who had not been diagnosed with stroke before the index age of 55 years using cumulative incidence analysis adjusting for competing risks. By 2003, 868 subjects had suffered stroke (512 (58.9%) were women and 542 (62.4%) experienced ischemic stroke). BP was a significant factor in determining risk of stroke for men and women, with distributions of cumulative risk for stroke significantly different across BP groups. The LTR of all-stroke for normotension (systolic BP/diastolic BP < 120/80 mm Hg), prehypertension (120-139/80-89 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (140-159/90-99 mm Hg) and stage 2 hypertension (> 160/100 mm Hg) were 13.8-16.9-25.8-25.8% in men and 16.0-19.9-24.0-30.5% in women, respectively (P < 0.001 among BP groups in both sexes). The estimates did not differ significantly (P = 0.16) between normotensive and prehypertensive subjects. One in five Japanese atomic bomb survivor subjects experienced stroke over their lifetime from the age of 55 years. Long-term stroke risks were elevated in those with hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg) at any of the index ages of 45, 55, 65 and 75 years."

The total absorbed radiation doses were equal to or less than 57 cGy. Observed changes in the FTIR spectra represent the damage in the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of nucleic acid, which seem to be connected with modification of bases and sugars, and redistribution of the H-bond network.

636,Included,"The Radio-protective effects of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester and Thymoquinone in rats exposed to total head irradiation Background: Many cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side effects during and after their treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of irradiation and the addition of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and thymoquinone (TQ) on the oxidant/antioxidant system in the liver tissue of irradiated rats. Methods: A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of thymoquinone and caffeic acid phenethyl ester administered by intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Results: While liver tissue total oxidant status, lipid hydroperoxide level, and oxidative stress index were significantly increased in the irradiated (IR) group, compared with other groups, total antioxidant status, sulfhydryl levels, and paraoxonase (PON) activity were significantly decreased. Ceruloplasmin activity in IR plus TQ and IR groups was higher than the control group. Arylesterase and PON activities in IR plus TQ- and IR plus CAPE-supplemented groups were lower than those of control groups. Conclusions: TQ and CAPE decrease oxidative stress markers and have antioxidant effects, which also augment antioxidant capacity in the liver tissue of irradiated rats.

3090,Excluded,"The PET Radioligand 18F-FIMX Images and Quantifies Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in Proportion to the Regional Density of Its Gene Transcript in Human Brain UNLABELLED: A recent study from our laboratory found that (18)F-FIMX is an excellent PET radioligand for quantifying metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in monkey brain. This study evaluated the ability of (18)F-FIMX to quantify mGluR1 in humans. A second goal was to use the relative density of mGluR1 gene transcripts in brain regions to estimate specific uptake and nondisplaceable uptake (VND) in each brain region.METHODS: After injection of 189 +/- 3 MBq of (18)F-FIMX, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic PET scan over 120 min. For 6 volunteers, images were acquired until 210 min. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was measured from the radial artery. Four other subjects underwent whole-body scanning to estimate radiation exposure.RESULTS: (18)F-FIMX uptake into the human brain was high (SUV = 4-6 in the cerebellum), peaked at about 10 min, and washed out rapidly. An unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model fitted the data well, and distribution volume (VT) (mLcm(-3)) values ranged from 1.5 in the caudate to 11 in the cerebellum. A 120-min scan provided stable VT values in all regions except the cerebellum, for which an acquisition time of at least 170 min was necessary. VT values in brain regions correlated well with mGluR1 transcript density, and the correlation suggested that VND of (18)F-FIMX was quite low (0.5 mLcm(-3)). This measure of VND in humans was similar to that from a receptor blocking study in monkeys, after correcting for differences in plasma protein binding. Similar to other (18)F-labeled ligands, the effective dose was about 23 muSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: (18)F-FIMX can quantify mGluR1 in the human brain with a 120- to 170-min scan. Correlation of brain uptake with the relative density of mGluR1 transcript allows specific receptor binding of a radioligand to be quantified without injecting pharmacologic doses of a blocking agent."

[Russian] The study was aimed at investigation of the characteristic features of intestinal dysbacteriosis in man under extreme conditions and development of methods for correcting intestinal microflora for prevention of dysbacteriosis under such conditions. Microbiocenosis of the intestine was investigated in 99 practically healthy persons under model earth conditions and in 34 cosmonauts after space flights of various duration. The following factors influencing intestinal microflora in man under extreme conditions were studied: neuroemotional tension, hypokinesia, increased physical loads, isolation under conditions of altered gaseous environment and microclimate. The study revealed that the above factors participated in development of dysbacteriosis. It was shown that the neuroemotional stress played the main role in development of dysbacteriosis in man under extreme conditions: intestinal microflora responded under extreme conditions by decreased counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli participating in maintenance of the intact ecological barrier and colonization resistance. For preventing dysbacteriotic reactions of intestinal microflora it was recommended to use bifidobacterin tablets. Bifidobacterin correction was shown to be efficient in prevention of dysbacteriosis in persons under extreme conditions."
2025,Excluded,"Pre-treatment of adult rats with high doses of erythropoietin induces caspase-9 but prevents light-induced retinal injury Erythropoietin (Epo) had been shown to have a neuroprotective effect independent from its erythropoietic properties. In this study, we tested whether Epo could protect the retina from damage induced by a long period of moderate light insult and how it protected. First, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) by human recombinant Epo at 5000 or 30,000U/kg to assess Epo concentration in plasma and retina. Second, rats were untreated or injected i.p. with Epo at 30,000U/kg, 1 or 4h before being placed in constant light (24h; 2200lux). Electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded before treatment, 1day and 15days (D15) after light exposure. After the last ERG, eyes were taken for histology. In parallel, we tested Epo protection against oxidative stressors on isolated retinas and its effect on caspase-9 activity. Epo injected at 30,000U/kg body weight, 4h before exposure to the damaging light, protected retinal function and structure against light damage and induced an increase in caspase-9 activity and expression. Epo had no direct or indirect protective effect against free radicals-induced death on isolated retinas. Epo protected the retina from a long period of moderate light exposure through a mechanism independent from a free radical scavenging property or an antioxidant facilitating activity. The activation of caspase-9, 4h after Epo injection, corresponding to the start of light exposure, suggests that caspase-9 plays a role in neuroprotection."

Annual effective doses for flight crew have been estimated to be in the order of 2-5 mSv and can attain 75 mSv at career end. Epidemiological studies in this occupational group have been conducted over the last 15-20 years, usually with a focus on radiation-associated cancer. These studies are summarised in this note. Overall cancer risk was not elevated in most studies and subpopulations analysed, while malignant melanoma, other skin cancers and breast cancer in female aircrew have shown elevated incidence, with lesser risk elevations in terms of mortality. In some studies, including the large German cohort, brain cancer risk appears elevated. Cardiovascular mortality risks were generally very low. Dose information for pilots was usually derived from calculation procedures based on routine licence information, types of aircraft and routes/hours flown, but not on direct measurements. However, dose estimates have shown high validity when compared with measured values. No clear-cut dose-response patterns pointing to a higher risk for those with higher cumulative doses were found. Studies on other health outcomes have shown mixed results. Overall, aircrew are a highly selected group with many specific characteristics and exposures that might also influence cancers or other health outcomes. Radiation-associated health effects have not been clearly established in the studies available so far."

In this study, in order to validate nuclear data and the neutron transportation performance of the materials related to ADS, we measured the leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies using 14.8 MeV D-T neutrons. Two types of assemblies comprising A-1 (W+U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) and A-2 (U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) were both built up gradually starting with the first wall. The measured spectra were compared with those calculated using the Monte Carlo code neutron transport coed (MCNP)-4C. A comparison of the results showed that the experimental leakage neutron spectra for both A-1 or A-2 were reproduced well by the three evaluated nuclear data libraries with discrepancies of less than 15% (A-1) and 12% (A-2), except when below 3 MeV. For 2-cm and 5-cm uranium samples, the CENDL-3.1 calculations exhibited large discrepancies in the energy range of 2-8 MeV and above 13 MeV. Thus, the CENDL-3.1 library for uranium should be reevaluated, especially around this energy range.

OM typically affects the elderly and is often associated with neurodegenerative disease. We sought to review the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of OM due to brain tumor treatment, the first reported lesional cases of this rare disorder.METHODS: The database of the Mayo Clinic Rochester Movement Disorders Laboratory was searched for all patients diagnosed with OM from January 2007 to December 2016. All available clinical, radiographic, and surface electromyographic data were reviewed, and patients with a history of primary or metastatic brain tumor were analyzed.RESULTS: Two patients with OM and brain tumor were identified; both had undergone tumor resection and targeted brain radiation. Both patients complained of unsteadiness while walking and recurrent falls. Tumor pathology (atypical meningioma, gliosarcoma) was centered in the frontal lobe and extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-SMA, or prefrontal cortex. Medications did not improve gait.CONCLUSION: Two cases of brain tumor-related OM suggest that degeneration of frontal motor programming circuits underlies the pathophysiology of OM."
567,Excluded,"Spinal and supraspinal effects of long-term stimulation of sensorimotor cortex in rats Sensorimotor cortex (SMC) modifies spinal cord reflex function throughout life and is essential for operant conditioning of the H-reflex. To further explore this long-term SMC influence over spinal cord function and its possible clinical uses, we assessed the effect of long-term SMC stimulation on the soleus H-reflex. In freely moving rats, the soleus H-reflex was measured 24 h/day for 12 wk. The soleus background EMG and M response associated with H-reflex elicitation were kept stable throughout. SMC stimulation was delivered in a 20-day-on/20-day-off/20-day-on protocol in which a train of biphasic 1-ms pulses at 25 Hz for 1 s was delivered every 10 s for the on-days. The SMC stimulus was automatically adjusted to maintain a constant descending volley. H-reflex size gradually increased during the 20 on-days, stayed high during the 20 off-days, and rose further during the next 20 on-days. In addition, the SMC stimulus needed to maintain a stable descending volley rose steadily over days. It fell during the 20 off-days and rose again when stimulation resumed. These results suggest that SMC stimulation, like H-reflex operant conditioning, induces activity-dependent plasticity in both the brain and the spinal cord and that the plasticity responsible for the H-reflex increase persists longer after the end of SMC stimulation than that underlying the change in the SMC response to stimulation."
90,Excluded,"Lower stimulation frequency can enhance tolerability and efficacy of pallidal deep brain stimulation for dystonia We report the case of a patient with medically refractory primary dystonia who was treated with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. Stimulation at 130 Hz or higher, by means of the more ventral contacts generated capsular side effects, which made their use impractical. Consequently, the patient was treated for 9 months at 130 to 185 Hz, by means of the more dorsal contacts, achieving modest results. By reducing the stimulation frequency to 80 Hz, we were able to activate the ventral contacts without inducing side effects. Within days, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in function that has persisted for 1 year. A further reduction in stimulation frequency to 60 Hz resulted in a worsening of his symptoms. We conclude that chronic stimulation at frequencies of <100 Hz may be efficacious in dystonia and may enhance the tolerability of stimulation by means of contacts that are positioned posteroventrally within the internal globus pallidus, nearer the internal capsule."

Thymopentin (10 mg/kg/day/7 days) was injected intraperitoneally in groups of C57BL/6 mice. Then, interleukin-1 alpha was administered on day 7. Twenty hr later, all groups were given whole body sublethal irradiation of 750 rad by 60Co elements. In some groups of mice, treatment with thymopentin was continued for 1 week after irradiation. Efficacy of the combination treatment was assessed by evaluation of mortality, as well as by histologic examination of the brain, testis, bone marrow, heart and spleen. The combination of relatively low doses of interleukin-1 alpha (700 U) with thymopentin yielded a survival which was nearly that observed with interleukin-1 alpha (1000 U) given alone (about 100%). The optimal effect was observed in animals treated for 15 days with thymopentin, either in combination or alone. In addition, incidence and severity of histological lesions were also lower in animals with the some treatment schedule. Our results suggest that the combined treatment thymopentin-interleukin-1 alpha prevents radiation damage in the mouse."

Patients and methods. - Seventy-six patients (instead of the 106 planned patients; study was stopped after the interim analysis) were randomised receiving either fotemustine (arm A, n = 39) or fotemustine and whole brain irradiation (arm B, n = 37). Fotemustine was administered intravenously at 100 mg m<sup>-2</sup> on day 1, 8 and 15, followed by a 5-week rest period, then every 3 weeks in non-progressive patients. In arm B, a concomitant whole brain irradiation was performed at the total dose of 37.5 Gy (2.5 Gy/d<sup>-1</sup>, days 1-5, 3 consecutive weeks). Results. - Although patients who received fotemustine alone had worse prognostic factors, there was no significant difference in brain response (arm A: 7.4%, B: 10.0%) or control rates (objective response plus stable disease) after seven weeks (arm A: 30%, B: 47%) and overall survival (arm A: 86d, B: 105d).

To exploit this, we have functionalized a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) with an alpha-emitter astatine-211. This approach offers enhanced cytotoxicity from conventional PARPis by not requiring enzymatic inhibition of PARP-1 to elicit DNA damage; instead, the alpha-particle directly induces multiple double-strand DNA breaks across the particle track. Here, we explored the efficacy of [<sup>211</sup>At]MM4 in multiple cancers and found neuroblastoma to be highly sensitive in vitro and in vivo.

1293,Excluded,"Monitoring of mental performance during spaceflight Mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight may suffer from both direct effects of microgravity on perceptual, cognitive, and psychomotor processes, and unspecific stress effects on these functions due to high workload sleep disturbances, or the general burden of adapting to the extreme living conditions in space. Early detection of any signs of mental performance impairments seems to be essential for mission success and to prevent obvious performance decrements in critical mission tasks. One possible approach to this problem is to assess the astronaut's performance on specific screening tests repeatedly during a space mission and to compare the results with a self-referenced baseline established pre-flight. The selection of screening tests for this purpose should be guided by three different criteria: 1) their reliability; 2) their sensitivity (i.e., their power to reveal subtle mental performance changes induced by internal or external stressors during spaceflight); and 3) their diagnosticity (i.e., their capability to reveal the underlying processes that lead to these performance deficits). Based on a discussion of these theoretical issues, first attempts to monitor mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight by means of short-term laboratory tasks are reviewed. The results of these studies suggest that, in particular, perceptual-motor tasks (tracking) and tasks placing comparatively high demands on attentional processes (e.g., dual-tasks) represent sensitive monitoring measures. First studies on the diagnositicity of tracking performance decrements during spaceflight suggest that they reflect both microgravity-related changes in the sensory-motor system as well as unspecific stress-effects, with the former factor reflected primarily in tracking performance decrements during early adaptation to the microgravity environment.

The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3."
993,Excluded,"Dietary instead of pharmacological management to counter the adverse effects of physiological adaptations to space flight The development of pharmacological counter-measures to the adverse effects of physiological adaptation to microgravity has received relatively more attention than alternatives such as dietary management. The manipulation of dietary cation-anion balance, and its subsequent effects on acid-base metabolism, have been routinely used for some time in managing domestic animal health. More recently, dietary intake by humans of alkalinizing potassium salts has been demonstrated to exert profound beneficial effects on calcium balance, bone mineralization, predisposition to calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, and overall nitrogen balance. Dietary sodium restriction has also been shown to improve calcium balance, bone mineralization, and the effectiveness of neurohumoral defenses against orthostatic hypotension. It is proposed that these simple alterations in the astronauts' diets may be easily implemented to lessen the adverse effects of physiological adaptations to space flight, and to enhance or even replace prescribed pharmacological counter-measures.

The mean tumor volume was 3.71 ccm (range: 0.11-22.10 ccm). Based on the protocol guidelines, 21 patients were treated with SRS and 12 patients with SRT, 2 patients received both consecutively.RESULTS: The median follow-up (FU) reached 8 years with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 87.3% [confidence interval (CI): 70.8-95.6%] and 5-year local control rate of 97.1% (CI: 83.4-99.8%). Almost 80% (28/35) presented tumor shrinkage during FU. Endocrinological cure was achieved in 23% and IGF-1 normalization with reduced medication was achieved in 40% of all patients. An endocrinological response was generally achieved within the first 3 years, but endocrinological cure can require more than 8 years. A new adrenocorticotropic hypopituitarism occurred in 13 patients (46.4%). A new visual field disorder and a new oculomotor palsy occurred in 1 patient, respectively. Patients with occurrence of visual/neurological impairments had a longer FU (p = 0.049).CONCLUSION: Our SRS/SRT protocol proved to be safe and successful in terms of tumor control and protection of the visual system. The timing and rate of endocrine improvements are difficult to predict. One has to accept an unavoidable rate of additional adrenocorticotropic hypopituitarism in the long term."

A thymoma was diagnosed following ultrasound and biopsy of the mass. Treatment was initiated with coarse-fraction radiation therapy using external-beam therapy (four fractions of 5 Gy). The mass responded, but granulocytopenia developed. Bone marrow examination showed a myeloid to erythroid ratio of approximately 1:1, with a left shift within the myeloid line. These findings, as well as the lack of toxic changes within the peripheral blood neutrophils, suggested immune-mediated destruction of peripheral granulocytes. Immune suppression with prednisone and cyclosporine was instituted. After 7 weeks, the neutrophil count returned to normal. The tumor was removed, and cyclosporine was reduced and eventually discontinued 3 weeks postsurgery."
676,Included,"Brain irradiation leads to persistent neuroinflammation and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in a region-specific manner Long-term cognitive deficits are observed after treatment of brain tumors or metastases by radiotherapy. Treatment optimization thus requires a better understanding of the effects of radiotherapy on specific brain regions, according to their sensitivity and interconnectivity. In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere. These structural damages translated into selective behavioral changes including spatial memory loss, disinhibition of anxiety-like behaviors, hyperactivity and pain hypersensitivity, but no significant alteration in motor coordination and grip strength abilities. Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction."

We report on patients treated within a prospective trial, correlating doses to tumor volume, combined with chemotherapy sequentially. Method(s): Radiation doses to primary tumors were aligned along increasing tumor size within 4 groups (<2.5 cm/ 2.5-4.5 cm/ 4.5- 6.0 cm/ >6.0 cm; mean number of three perpendicular diameters). ICRU-doses of 73.8 Gy/ 79.2 Gy/ 84.6 Gy/ 90.0 Gy, respectively, were applied. Macroscopically involved nodes were treated with a median dose of 59.4 Gy, nodal sites about 6 cm cranial to involved nodes electively with 45 Gy. Fractional doses were 1.8 Gy twice daily (bid). 2 cycles chemotherapy were given before radiotherapy; the interval between chemotherapy and radiotherapy was prefe- rentially shorter than 8 days. With a median follow up time of 56.1 months (range 43.2 - 97.1 ) for patients alive, mature results for locoregional tumor control, survival and toxicity are presented. Result(s): Between 2004 and 2009,123 continuously referred, unselected patients with 127 histologically/ cytologically proven NSCLC were enrolled; Stage II: 6 pts.; IIIA: 70 pts.; IIIB: 47 pts. Weight loss >5%/ 3 months: 26%; Karnofsky Index <= 70%: 46% of the patients. The local tumor control rate at 2-/ 5 years is 73%/ 70%, respectively; the regional tumor control rate 91%/ 89%, respectively. The median overall survival time is 24.6 months, the 2- and 5-year overall survival rates are 52% and 19%, respectively. 2 treatment-related deaths (progressive pulmonary fibrosis) occurred in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis. Further toxicity was mild or moderate: Pneumonitis grade 2/ 3 (n=10/ 6); esophagitis grade 2/ 3 (n=16/ 7). Lung late grade 2 (n=13), esophagus late grade 3 (n=1). Conclusion(s): Locoregional tumor control is high; as are survival times for this unselected patient cohort. In all outcome parameters DART-bid seems to compare favourably with simultaneous chemoradiotherapies, at present considered 'state of the art'; simultaneous treatments however are applicable only to a minority of referred patients, patients in good general condition."

Consolidation cytarabine was given after the radiotherapy. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving rdWBRT. Exploratory end points included prospective neuropsychological evaluation, analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter changes using the Fazekas scale, and evaluation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a prognostic factor.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with median age of 60 years (range, 30 to 79 years) and median Karnofsky performance score of 70 (range, 50 to 100). Thirty-one patients (60%) achieved a CR after R-MPV and received rdWBRT. The 2-year PFS for this group was 77%; median PFS was 7.7 years. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached (median follow-up for survivors, 5.9 years); 3-year OS was 87%. The overall (N = 52) median PFS was 3.3 years, and median OS was 6.6 years. Cognitive assessment showed improvement in executive function (P < .01) and verbal memory (P < .05) after chemotherapy, and follow-up scores remained relatively stable across the various domains (n = 12). All examined MRIs (n = 28) displayed a Fazekas score of <= 3, and no patient developed scores of 4 to 5; differences in ADC values did not predict response (P = .15), PFS (P = .27), or OS (P = .33).CONCLUSION: R-MPV combined with consolidation rdWBRT and cytarabine is associated with high response rates, long-term disease control, and minimal neurotoxicity."
333,Excluded,"Temozolomide for central nervous system involvement in mycosis fungoides BACKGROUND: The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most commonly involved sites in the systemic progression of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) such as mycosis fungoides (MF). There is no consensus on the treatment of CNS progression in CTCL, but survival of 3-6 months is suggested when methotrexate-based chemotherapy and/or CNS irradiation is used. Temozolomide is active in earlier stages of MF and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There are no published data on its use in MF patients with CNS involvement.METHODS: Four MF patients were treated with oral temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 d on a 28-day cycle) for CNS progression. Two patients received temozolomide with low-dose CNS irradiation as initial treatment, and two received temozolomide following disease progression after methotrexate-based chemotherapy and CNS irradiation. All patients received dexamethasone.RESULTS: Temozolomide was well tolerated; there were no treatment withdrawals or dose reductions caused by toxicity. Patient 1 had an excellent partial response in pre-irradiated disease. Patient 2 showed disease stabilization following irradiation. Patient 3 showed a complete response after a partial response to irradiation. Patient 4 demonstrated continued stabilization after a partial response to irradiation. Overall survival ranged from 10 to 33 months. Patient 3 remains alive and symptom-free at 23 months following treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide following low-dose CNS irradiation appears to be well tolerated and effective in MF patients with CNS progression. It may represent a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy containing methotrexate or an option for second-line therapy."

2922,Excluded,"Saturation of DNA repair measured by alkaline elution To determine whether the half-times (T1/2) of the DNA repair processes measured by alkaline elution increased in a dose-dependent manner, exponentially growing 9L/Ro rat brain tumor cells were irradiated with doses of 15-50 Gy, and their DNA repair kinetics was measured by alkaline elution. At 15 Gy, the DNA repair kinetics was biphasic with the fast phase having a T1/2 approximately 6 min and the slow phase having a T1/2 approximately 42 min. As the dose was increased to 50 Gy, the fast-phase T1/2 remained at approximately 6 min, but the slow-phase T1/2 increased to approximately 87 min. Although a dose-dependent increase in the T1/2 of the slow phase of DNA repair (saturation) was measured by alkaline elution, both the absolute value of the slow-phase T1/2 and the dependency of the slow-phase T1/2 on dose were less than those measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation in zonal rotors with slow reorienting gradient capability. Thus these two techniques appear either to depend on different hydrodynamic properties of the DNA or to have different coefficients of dependency for the same hydrodynamic properties of the DNA. The lower sensitivity for detection of the dose dependency of DNA repair makes it unlikely that the alkaline elution technique will be useful for quantitatively relating the shape of mammalian cell survival curves to the doses at which saturation of a DNA repair process occurs."
771,Excluded,"Stroke and thromboembolic events in men with prostate cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PC) and the risk of developing stroke and thromboembolic events. Our study evaluated the association between ADT use and development of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in a homogenous group of men with PC treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) after controlling for multiple sources of confounding.METHODS: Observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with PC at the US Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 January 2001 and October 31, 2015 and treated with definitive RT. Exposure was initiation of ADT within 1 year of PC diagnosis. Primary outcomes were development of stroke, TIA, DVT, or PE.RESULTS: 44,246 men with median follow-up of 6.8 years. The overall cumulative incidences of stroke, TIA, DVT, and PE at 10 years were 6.0, 3.0, 3.4, and 1.9%, respectively. In the multivariable competing risks model, there was a significant association between ADT and stroke (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09-1.30, p < 0.01), TIA (SHR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.41, p < 0.01), and DVT (SHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04-1.34, p < 0.01). ADT was only associated with PE in men receiving ADT for > 1 year (SHR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.06-1.69, p-value = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in the risk of stroke, TIA, and DVT in men receiving ADT and an increased risk of PE in men receiving long-term ADT. These results highlight concerns regarding long-term risks of ADT on stroke and thromboembolic events in the treatment of PC."

This study aimed to evaluate the changes after stereotactic radiosurgery for AVMs.METHODS: Nineteen cases with cerebral AVMs had failure after stereotactic radiosurgery therapy. The symptoms and angiography were assessed. All patients underwent microsurgery. Pathologic examination was performed for all cases and electron microscopic examination was carried out in 6 patients.RESULTS: Seven cases had hemorrhage from 12 to 98 months after stereotactic radiosurgery, 5 had headache, 4 had refractory encephalon edema, 2 had epilepsy as a new symptom and 1 had a pressure cyst 5 years after radiosurgery. Angiography in 18 cases, 8 - 98 months after radiation therapy, demonstrated no significant changes in 5 cases, slight reduction in 9, near complete obliteration in 1 and complete obliteration in 3. An abnormal vessel was found on pathologic examination in 17 cases, even one case had obliterated in angiography. Electron microscopy examination showed vessel wall weakness, but the vessels remained open and blood circulated. One case died because of a moribund state before surgery. The other 18 cases had no new neurological deficiencies, seizure control and no hemorrhage occurred after microsurgery at an average follow-up of 3 years.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiotherapy for AVMs should have a long period follow-up.

[Chinese] To study the development of changes for Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and its mRNA in rats hippocampus after electromagnetic radiation. Rats were exposed to X-band high power microwave (X-HPM), S-band high power microwave (S-HPM) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation source respectively. The animal model of electromagnetic radiation was established. Western blot was used to detect the expression of RKIP, and RT-PCR was applied to detect the expression of RKIP mRNA. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 was measured with co-immunoprecipitation method, and the expression of cerebral choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) was measured by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RKIP significantly down-regulated at 6 h after radiation, and recovered at 1 d in group EMP, but the down-regulation continued during 1 approximately 7 d after radiation in the two microwave groups. The expression of RKIP mRNA changed wavily during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, which showed down-regulation at 6 h, and up-regulation at 3 d. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 decreased during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, most significantly at 7 d, and the two microwave groups were more significant. The expression of CHAT decreased continuously during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, and generally recovered on 14 d.

3129,Excluded,"Segmented TOF at 7T MRI: Technique and clinical applications Purpose: Time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography has an advantage of contrast and resolution in ultra-high field (7. T) MRI systems. However, increased specific absorption rate (SAR) prohibits the application of spatial saturation band, leading to venous contamination in maximum intensity projection (MIP) images. Method(s): A segmented k-space filling scheme with sparse venous saturation pulses was developed for 7. T TOF-MRA. The effectiveness of the segmented TOF sequence was verified by Bloch equation simulation and experiments on 3. T. The protocol on 7. T was optimized and applied for healthy volunteers and patients with vascular diseases. Result(s): Segmented TOF achieved equivalent contrast and venous suppression effect as conventional methods, while SAR values had a remarkable reduction and obeyed the limit of a 7. T MRI system. The decreased number of saturation pulses allowed shorter acquisition time than existing solutions. The comparison of segmented TOF and conventional TOF revealed flow direction in vascular diseases. Conclusion(s): Segmented TOF is proved to be a time-efficient way to achieve high-resolution angiograms without venous contamination at ultra-high field.

There is limited data to guide on optimal constraints to the adjacent nontarget brain. This investigation explored the significance of the three-dimensional (3D) dose distribution of passive scattering proton therapy to the brain with other clinicopathological factors on the development of symptomatic radiation necrosis. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with head and neck, skull base, or intracranial tumors who underwent proton therapy (minimum prescription dose of 59.4 Gy(RBE)) with collateral moderate to high dose radiation exposure to the nontarget brain were retrospectively reviewed. A mixture cure model with respect to necrosis-free survival was used to derive estimates for the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model while adjusting for potential confounding factors. Result(s): Of 179 identified patients, 83 patients had intracranial tumors and 96 patients had primary extracranial tumors. The optimal dose measure obtained to describe the occurrence of radiation necrosis was the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) with parameter a = 9. The best-fit parameters of logistic NTCP models revealed D<inf>50</inf> = 57.7 Gy for intracranial tumors, D<inf>50</inf> = 39.5 Gy for extracranial tumors, and gamma<inf>50</inf> = 2.5 for both tumor locations. Multivariable analysis revealed EUD and primary tumor location to be the strongest predictors of brain radiation necrosis.

In 61% of them neurocirculatory dystonia was found, 39% of patients revealed dyscirculatory encephalopathy. Alongside with dystonic disorders structural changes of vessels were detected. Asthenoneurosis diagnosed in 97% of patients was recognized as a key syndrome in 53%, while in 23%--obsessional-phobic syndrome dominated, in 7%--depressive syndrome and in 14%--psycho-organic syndrome were at the foreground. Somatic status in most patients (67%) was burdened by diseases of digestive tract. 191 patients revealed considerable immune imbalance. In 95 patients (33%) it was less pronounced and consisted in moderate decrease of TPR/TPS ratio. Degrees of immune and neurological disorders correlated closely. The conclusion was made that low-dose radiation induces primary damage of immunity and vessels with secondary nervous system involvement.

Survival analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Patients with BMs were first categorized as those with 1, 2-4, and 5-10 BMs based on the scheme proposed by Yamamoto et al. (Lancet Oncology 2014). Median overall survival for patients with 1 BM was superior to those with 2-4 BMs (7.1 months vs. 6.4 months, P = 0.009), and survival of patients with 2-4 BMs did not differ from those with 5-10 BMs (6.4 months vs. 6.3 months, P = 0.170). The median survival of patients with >10 BMs was lower than those with 2-10 BMs (6.3 months vs. 5.5 months, P = 0.025). In a multivariate model that accounted for age, Karnofsky Performance Score, systemic disease status, tumor histology, and cumulative intracranial tumor volume, we observed a ~10% increase in hazard of death when comparing patients with 1 versus 2-10 BMs (P < 0.001) or 10 versus >10 BMs (P < 0.001). When BM number was modeled as a continuous variable rather than using the classification by Yamamoto et al., we observed a step-wise 4% increase in the hazard of death for every increment of 6-7 BM (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of BM number to overall survival is modest and should be considered as one of the many variables considered in the decision between SRS and whole-brain radiation therapy."

[Russian] For 24 h after total gamma-radiation of mature Wistar male rats (180-210 g) in the dose of 150 Gy, ultrastructural rearrangements of the cerebral sensomotor cortex are presented as small destructive changes in neurons, neuroglia and vascular endothelium. Total combination of the changes in ultrastructure of the blood capillaries and perivascular astrocytes makes it possible to suppose that permeability of the microvascular bed wall is increased. At this period, together with the destructive changes there are evidently certain compensatory-restorative processes, developing in the cerebral tissue.

Shortly before saccade onset, dTMS with different interstimulus intervals (ISI; 35, 50, 65 or 80 ms) was applied. For contralateral saccades, dTMS significantly decreased saccadic latency with an ISI of 80 ms and increased saccadic gain with an ISI of 65 and 80 ms. Together with the findings of a previous study during frontal eye field (FEF) stimulation the present results demonstrate similarities and differences between both regions in the execution of memory-guided saccades. Firstly, dTMS facilitates saccade triggering in both regions, but the timing is different. Secondly, dTMS over the PPC provokes a hypermetria of contralateral memory-guided saccades that was not observed during FEF stimulation.

1554,Excluded,"Human mesenchymal stem cells home specifically to radiation-injured tissues in a non-obese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model The therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) has recently been brought into the spotlights of many fields of research. One possible application of the approach is the repair of tissue injuries related to side effects of radiotherapy. The first challenge in cell therapy is to assess the quality of the cell and the ability to retain their differentiation potential during the expansion process. Efficient delivery to the sites of intended action is also necessary. We addressed both challenges using hMSC cultured and then infused to non-obese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to total body irradiation. Furthermore, we tested the impact of additional abdominal irradiation superimposed to total body irradiation (TBI), as a model of local therapeutic irradiation. Our results showed that the hMSC used for transplant have been expanded without significant loss in their differentiation capacities. After transplantation into adult unconditioned mice, hMSC not only migrate in bone marrow but also into other tissues. Total body irradiation increased hMSC implantation in bone marrow and muscle and further led to engraftment in brain, heart and liver. Local irradiation in addition to TBI, increased homing of injected cells to the injured tissues and to other tissues outside the local irradiation field. Morphological recovery of irradiated tissues after MSC transplantation and/or differentiation of MSC into specific organ cell types needs to be investigated. This study suggests that using the potential of hMSC to home to various organs in response to tissue injuries might be a strategy to repair the radiation-induced damages."
2253,Excluded,"Radio- and chemotherapy of malignant gliomas. Pathological changes in the normal nervous tissue The pathological effects of radio- and chemotherapy on the normal nervous tissue have been studied in 42 brains with malignant gliomas. The brains have been examined by means of the complete study technique. In seven cases the picture of delayed radionecrosis has been found. Apart from this, many histological features have been related to post-operative survival, radiation dose, interval between radiation and death, chemotherapy, steroids, size and activity of the tumour. Some alterations, such as peritumoural necroses, macrophage areas, vessel wall degenerations etc. result from radiotherapy. The relations and pathogenesis are discussed."
684,Excluded,"Repeated head CT in the neurosurgical intensive care unit: feasibility of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit undergo multiple head CT scans, resulting in high cumulative radiation exposures. Our aim was to assess the acceptability of a dedicated, special-purpose sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT protocol for neurosurgical intensive care unit surveillance head CT examinations, comparing image quality with studies performed with our standard-of-care sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT and legacy filtered back-projection standard-dose CT protocols.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 54 head CT examinations: ultra-low-dose CT (n = 22), low-dose CT (n = 12), and standard-dose CT (n = 20) in 22 patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Standard-dose CT was reconstructed by using filtered back-projection on a Somatom Sensation 64 scanner. Ultra-low-dose CT and ultra-low-dose CT examinations were performed on a Siemens AS+128 scanner with commercially available sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative parameters, including image quality and dose, were evaluated.RESULTS: Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ultra-low-dose CT represented a 68% lower dose index volume compared with filtered back-projection standard-dose CT techniques in the same patients while maintaining similar quality and SNR levels. Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT offered higher image quality than filtered back-projection standard-dose CT (P < .05) with no differences in SNR at a 24% lower dose index volume. Compared with low-dose CT, ultra-low-dose CT had significantly lower SNR (P = .001) but demonstrated clinically satisfactory measures of image quality.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit, dedicated ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance head CT imaging led to a significant dose reduction while maintaining adequate image quality."
1996,Included,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury."
1140,Excluded,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ."
531,Excluded,"Local tumor control after retreatment of spinal metastasis using stereotactic body radiotherapy; comparison with initial treatment group BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate local control rates after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in recurrent spinal metastasis after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and new spinal metastatic lesions.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records and radiological data was performed on 54 retreatment and 131 initial SBRT patients. To compare various fractionation schedules, the biologically effective dose (BED) was applied. SBRT dose was calculated with linear-quadratic model and normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose (nBED, alpha/beta =2 Gy for spinal cord, alpha/beta =10 Gy for tumor). Doses to a point within the spinal cord that received the maximum dose (Pmax) were checked. Local control failure was defined as progression by imaging study. Overall survival, progression free survival, delivered radiation dose to tumor and spinal cord, and spinal cord Pmax nBED were compared in two groups.RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation doses to tumor margin during SBRT were 51.1 Gy2/10 (retreatment) and 50.7 Gy2/10 (initial treatment). Mean survival was 29.6 months (overall)/20.7 months (retreatment)/ 32.4 months (initial treatment). Mean progression free period was 23.9 months (overall)/18.0 months (retreatment)/ 26.0 months (initial treatment). Radiological control rates of retreatment and initial treatment group were 96%/95% at six months, 81%/89% at 12 months and 79%/90% at 24 months. Among 54 retreatment lesions, 13 lesions showed local control failure during follow-up. With regard to spinal cord radiation dose during SBRT, Spinal cord Pmax nBED was 46.2 Gy2/2 (retreatment) and 48.7 Gy2/2 (initial treatment). In retreatment group, total nBED to spinal cord was a mean of 83.4 Gy2/2. There was no case of radiation myelopathy detected.CONCLUSIONS: Retreatment of spinal metastases using SBRT provided effective local control without neurological complications."
2949,Included,"Effect of gonadotropin secretion rate on the radiosensitivity of the rat luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neuron and gonadotroph To test the hypothesis that the functional state of hypothalamic LHRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs might alter their radiosensitivity, we determined the experimental conditions under which the gonadotropin response to castration could be impaired by a single dose of cranial irradiation. Single doses of cranial irradiation greater than 2000 rads were lethal to unshielded rats. Shielding of the oropharynx and esophagus allowed the animals to survive doses up to 5000 rads. Doses between 2000 and 5000 rads had no effect on basal gonadotropin levels for as long as 3 months after irradiation. Irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment, however, in the gonadotropin response to castration. Impairment of the gonadotropin levels of castrate animals occurred in animals that were irradiated either before or after castration. However, rats irradiated in the castrate state showed a decreased susceptibility to irradiation damage. Additionally, stimulation of the pituitary by LHRH agonist (LHRHa) 3 h before irradiation significantly reduced the impairment of gonadotropin secretion 12-20 weeks after irradiation (P less than 0.05). Thus, increased functional activity of the rat hypothalamus or pituitary at the time of irradiation, induced by either castration or acute LHRHa administration, was associated with some protection against the gonadotropin-lowering effect of irradiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that stimulation of gonadotropin secretion at the time of therapeutic cranial irradiation in humans might protect against subsequent impairment of gonadotropin secretion."
275,Included,"Effect of low dose radiation on cognition, cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behaviour and cognitive functions. These changes depend largely on the dose received and time. While high radiation doses can cause severe tissue destruction, lower doses can induce cognitive impairments without signs of overt tissue damage. Radiation-induced cognitive impairments are reported to occur in up to 50-90% of adult brain tumour patients who survive more than 6 months post-irradiation. This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days. And a blood Serotonin and cortisol analysis was carried out using ELISA kits. Results obtained were analysed using one-way ANOVA. There was a significant decline in exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in open field test. We observed a significant decline in spontaneous Percent Alternation indicating the short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. 1 and 3 Gy irradiated mice exhibited increased anxiety in EPM. The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were statistically not significant. The changes to cortisol level were in a dose dependent manner and serotonin levels decreased with dose. Total antioxidant levels also showed the decreasing trend with respect to radiation doses, this pattern is similar to the pattern of cognitive decline shown in behaviour analysis suggesting that the antioxidant status maybe co-related to the radiation induced cognitive decline.

Neuropsyhological research has revealed at liquidators disorders of the higher mental functions, such as aspontanity, decrease speech and a visual memory, and also deficit of higher motor functions. According to the analysis of amplitude-time characteristics of component P300 acoustical cognitive EP a decrease in amplitude of this component at liquidators in all areas of the brain, for both experimental situations for all stimulus in comparison with healthy persons the same age was revealed. At the analysis of latent period (LP) P300 at liquidators the most distinct increase was revealed in a situation of passive listening for all kinds of stimulus. The analysis of reactivity of LP in different experimental situations has shown that at healthy persons during passive listening had similar values for all kinds of stimulus, and an account situation the maximum values--for significant stimulus. For liquidators the type of reaction in the form of increase in LP values at the majority of stimulus in both experimental situations. The analysis of regional LP changes of component P300 has found out the maximum distinctions between groups in frontal area of the left hemisphere. Along with it at liquidators the type the reactions similar for all shown stimulus without dependence from their importance in comparison with norm is revealed ""uneconomical, superfluous"". It can testify about decreasing of attention and memory reserves and to promote disorder of the higher mental functions. The described of amplitude-time characteristics of component P300 of acoustical EP at liquidators EP can testify to delay of perception, processing and the information analysis in a combination to easing of inhibitory processes leading to the higher mental dysfunctions. The obtained data have similarity to people of old age, supporting a hypothesis about the accelerated ageing of a brain, and also about pathological development of processes of ageing as a result of influence of low doses of radiation."
480,Excluded,"Clinical trial of blood-brain barrier disruption by pulsed ultrasound The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the delivery of systemically administered drugs to the brain. Methods to circumvent the BBB have been developed, but none are used in standard clinical practice. The lack of adoption of existing methods is due to procedural invasiveness, serious adverse effects, and the complications associated with performing such techniques coincident with repeated drug administration, which is customary in chemotherapeutic protocols. Pulsed ultrasound, a method for disrupting the BBB, was shown to effectively increase drug concentrations and to slow tumor growth in preclinical studies. We now report the interim results of an ultrasound dose-escalating phase 1/2a clinical trial using an implantable ultrasound device system, SonoCloud, before treatment with carboplatin in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The BBB of each patient was disrupted monthly using pulsed ultrasound in combination with systemically injected microbubbles. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the BBB was disrupted at acoustic pressure levels up to 1.1 megapascals without detectable adverse effects on radiologic (MRI) or clinical examination. Our preliminary findings indicate that repeated opening of the BBB using our pulsed ultrasound system, in combination with systemic microbubble injection, is safe and well tolerated in patients with recurrent GBM and has the potential to optimize chemotherapy delivery in the brain."
2190,Excluded,"Treatment for older diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with cognitive impairment and dementia Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is often diagnosed between ages 60 and 70 years old. The population of older adults in the United States is projected to undergo rapid growth and increased life expectancy over the coming decades; thus, cancer cases among older adults will jointly be expected to increase. Comorbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or dementia (CID), will also be more likely to be present at diagnosis of cancer in older adults and affect both treatment decision-making and prognosis. Few studies have evaluated treatment utilization patterns among older DLBCL patients with CID. Objective(s): Our objective was to describe treatment utilization patterns in older DLBCL patients with CID. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of 10 626 DLBCL patients ages 66 and older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, of whom 410 (3.9%) had CID prior to cancer diagnosis. Medicare beneficiaries with a first primary DLBCL diagnosis between 2001 and 2011 were identified. Validated algorithms utilizing administrative claims, diagnoses and procedures codes were used to identify CID and primary treatment with chemo-immunotherapy and radiation. The association between CID and receipt of treatment was determined using multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Result(s): Fewer patients with CID diagnoses received any DLBCL treatment (chemo-immunotherapy or radiation) compared with patients without CID (41% versus 65%). In multivariable models, patients with CID had significantly lower odds of any treatment (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.38-0.59). These findings were consistent for treatment with chemo-immunotherapy (OR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.35-0.55) but not radiation (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59-1.06). In stratified analyses, patients aged 66-74 years (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.23-0.76) and Ann Arbor stage I-II (OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.29-0.53) had the lowest odds of treatment. Conclusion(s): In summary, patients with CID were less likely to receive chemo-immunotherapy or radiation to treat DLBCL, and multiple factors could explain this less aggressive approach taken among these older patients. It remains unclear how CID and these differences in care influence survival. Further research on patient and caregiver preferences, treatment decision-making, and alternative treatment options for older patients with comorbid lymphoma and CID is warranted."

When adequate thickness of material is used, the guard can attenuate forward and back scatter radiation, separate the adjacent tissues from metal restorations, and protect the oral mucosa from localized incidents of mucositis."
2874,Excluded,"Short-term synaptic depression and recovery at the mature mammalian endbulb of Held synapse in mice The endbulb of Held synapses between the auditory nerve fibers (ANF) and cochlear nucleus bushy neurons convey fine temporal information embedded in the incoming acoustic signal. The dynamics of synaptic depression and recovery is a key in regulating synaptic transmission at the endbulb synapse. We studied short-term synaptic depression and recovery in mature (P22-38) CBA mice with stimulation rates that were comparable to sound-driven activities recorded in vivo. Synaptic depression in mature mice is less severe ( approximately 40% at 100 Hz) than reported for immature animals and the depression is predominately due to depletion of releasable vesicles. Recovery from depression depends on the rate of activity and accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ at the presynaptic terminal. With a regular stimulus train at 100 Hz in 2 mM external [Ca2+], the recovery from depletion was slow (tauslow, approximately 2 s). In contrast, a fast (taufast, approximately 25 ms), Ca2+-dependent recovery followed by a slower recovery (tauslow, approximately 2 s) was seen when stimulus rates or external [Ca2+] increased. In normal [Ca2+], recovery from a 100-Hz Poisson-like train is rapid, suggesting that Poisson-like trains produce a higher internal [Ca2+] than regular trains. Moreover, the fast recovery was slowed by approximately twofold in the presence of calmidazolium, a Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor. Our results suggest that endbulb synapses from high spontaneous firing rate auditory nerve fibers normally operate in a depressed state. The accelerated synaptic recovery during high rates of activity is likely to ensure that reliable synaptic transmission can be achieved at the endbulb synapse."
1434,Excluded,"Palliative radiation for spinal metastases: Does the presence of soft tissue disease affect the choice of treatment dose and fractionation? Purpose/Objective(s): Spinal bone metastases associated with soft tissue disease (ST) are frequently considered at higher risk of developing further complications such as neuropathic pain and cord compression. The objectives of our study were to describe the prevalence of ST in patients presenting for spine radiation therapy (XRT), and whether presence of soft tissue disease is associated with a difference in treatment approach compared with those whose do not (nST). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all consecutive patients receiving spine XRT within our palliative radiation program during 2012. Patient demographics, symptoms intensity, performance status and life expectancy were captured at the time of consultation. Diagnostic imaging including CT +/- MRI as well as planning CT relevant to the course of treatment were reviewed to document whether ST, cord compression (CC) or compression fracture (CF) was present at the levels being irradiated. Whether a field based or volume based approach was employed by the radiation oncologist to define the treatment plan was recorded. Binary logistic regression was used for inferences, using the generalized estimating equation approach to adjust the standard error to account for the correlation of observations within a patient. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients receiving 177 treatments were reviewed. This included 19 patients receiving simultaneous treatment to 2 separate sites and 4 patients receiving treatment to 3 sites. The mean age was 64 years. 71% (106/150) of patients in both groups were estimated to have a life expectancy of over 6 months. Fifty-five percent of treatments given were in the lumbosacral area. Nocomplicating radiological features (i.e., noST, CC, CF) was present in 89/177 (50%) of cases. ST was present in 50/177 cases [28% [95% CI 25-32%)]. Of these,32%(16/50) also had aCCand 32%(16/50) had aCF. There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution and source of primary. The proportion of patients with severe pain (>5 on a scale of 0-10) was 46% ST and 60% nST (p = 0.82). Volume based planning was employed for 58% ST and 48% nST. Fractionated treatments (mostly 20 Gy/ 5 fractions) were employed in 84% ST and 66% nST of cases. After adjustment for CC and CF, there was a trend to suggest physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated treatments in cases with ST (p =0.16). Conclusion(s): Fifty percent of treatment courses delivered to spine were associated with some complicating radiological features including ST, SC or CF. ST was present in 28% cases. We were unable to identify any clinical features that would predict for the presence of ST disease. There is a trend that physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated radiation therapy when ST was present."
624,Excluded,"miR-34a in Neurophysiology and Neuropathology Epigenetic influence of brain and neuronal function plays key regulatory roles in health and diseases. The microRNA miR-34a is a tumor suppressor transcript, and its loss has been prominently linked to various human cancers, including malignancies of the brain. Interestingly, miR-34a is abundantly expressed in the adult mammalian brain, and emerging evidence has implicated its involvement in a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropathological processes. Developmentally, miR-34a regulates neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation and aspects of neurogenesis. During aging, its elevation is connected to hearing loss and age-related macular degeneration. Pathologically, its elevations during epileptic seizures and ischemic stroke contribute to neuronal injury and death. Inhibition or suppression of miR-34a improved neuronal survival against a variety of neurotoxins implicated in Parkinson's disease. Its elevation may also play a role in neuronal demise in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, and suppression of its levels may be generally neuroprotective. The roles and activities of miR-34a in the brain are modulated by factors that control its expression (such as Tp53/73), as well as its downstream target genes (such as the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6) and signaling pathways (such the Notch pathway). We discuss here the known and emerging roles of the miR-34a regulatory network in neurophysiology and neuropathology.

2280,Excluded,"Effects of ionizing radiation on brain metastasis-associated inflammation and its implication for immunotherapy Brain metastases represent the most common intracranial tumor in adults associated with poor prognosis and median survival of only a few months. Despite current success in the development of targeted or immunotherapies against different cancer entities, those strategies are ineffective against brain metastases. Hence, treatment options for brain metastasis patients largely remain limited to surgical resection and radioand/ or chemotherapy. This paucity can in part be attributed to the immune-privileged status of the brain where the blood brain-barrier restricts the entry of blood-borne immune cells. However, recent insights into the immune landscape of primary brain cancers indicate that tumor progression leads to an infiltration of blood-borne immune cells into the brain. We employ a comprehensive set of experimental brain metastasis models to characterize the immune landscape of brain metastases from different primary cancer entities at distinct disease stages and in response to radiotherapy. Our data indicate that brain metastases induce massive infiltration of myeloid and lymphoid cell populations into the central nervous system. This leads to the establishment of a dynamic and highly complex tumor microenvironment that affects tumor progression and therapy response. Fractionated whole-brain radiotherapy leads to enhanced infiltration of blood-borne myeloid and lymphoid cells. Transcriptome analysis of brain-resident and recruited myeloid cells indicate a switch from a proinflammatory towards an immune-suppressive environment at advanced disease stages. Importantly, radiotherapy was found to induce gene signatures that are associated with proinflammatory innate immune responses that could revert the establishment of an immune-suppressive environment. Consequently, radiotherapy might sensitize brain metastases towards immunotherapies. Our goal is to identify pathways or molecular targets that are induced by radiotherapy in the tumor microenvironment to overcome resistance against immunotherapy. In this project, we seek to test strategies to maintain or induce proinflammatory immune responses for improved targeted or immunotherapies against brain metastasis."
699,Excluded,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals."

Forty patients who have had NPC successfully treated by a single radical course of radiotherapy of 70-80 Gy were studied at 2-12 years (mean 6.2 years) after radiotherapy. Each patient was examined clinically and with a pure-tone audiogram. Averaged hearing thresholds over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz were evaluated and a value > 30 dB was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with age-matched controls. The median hearing threshold for each ear in NPC patients was found to be 31.9 dB (range 10.0-86.3 dB) and that for controls 17.5 dB (7.5-38.8 dB) (P < 0.0005, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test). In NPC patients, 44 ears (55.0%) had abnormal hearing, of which 17 (21.3%), 5 (6.3%) and 22 (27.5%) ears had predominantly sensori-neural, conductive and mixed hearing losses, respectively. Nineteen ears had middle ear effusions, accounting for the majority of mixed and conductive hearing losses. In terms of individual patients, 8 (20.0%) and 18 (45.0%) patients had abnormal hearing in one year (monaural hearing disability) and both ears (binaural hearing disability), respectively. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients who have had radiotherapy for NPC, have hearing disability in the long-term, as compared to normal controls."

PURPOSE: Selection of candidates for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is increasingly based on receptor positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, including the common tracer Ga DOTATOC. However, no studies have yet compared standardized uptake values (SUVs) and absorbed doses in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 21 patients with 61 evaluable tumor lesions undergoing both pretherapeutic Ga DOTATOC-PET/CT (Biograph Duo [Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany]; PET acquisition, 75.3 +/- 15.4 minutes postinjection; 117.3 +/- 33.9 MBq Ga DOTATOC) and PRRT with Lu octreotate (7.47 +/- 1.39 GBq; intratherapeutic tumor dosimetry with serial whole-body scans; 1, 2, and 4 days postinjection) at our institution. SUVs were compared with the tumor-absorbed doses per injected activity (D/A0) of the subsequent first treatment cycle. RESULT(S): The correlation of SUV and D/A0 was r = 0.72 (SUVmean) and r = 0.71 (SUVmax), both P < 0.001. Pancreatic origin and hepatic localization were associated with higher D/A0, and chromogranin A level and Ki-67 index had no influence on SUV or D/A0. High-SUV lesions (SUVmean >15; SUVmax >25) resulted in high D/A0 (>10 Gy/GBq) in 66.7% to 70.8% and low D/A0 (<5 Gy/GBq) in only 8.3% to 12.5% on subsequent PRRT. The mentioned low D/A0 range, on the other hand, was achieved by all lesions with SUVmean <7 or SUVmax <9. CONCLUSION(S): Somatostatin receptor PET imaging may predict tumor-absorbed doses. The ability to indicate insufficient target irradiation by a low SUV could aid in selection of appropriate candidates for PRRT. However, larger series are needed to confirm and validate these initial findings. Â© 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."
2430,Excluded,"beta-Amyloid Peptide Antagonizes the Effect of Protons on Taurine-Induced Chloride Current in Rat Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons Taurine is an important endogenous agonist of glycine receptors (GlyR). Using the patchclamp technique, we measured chloride current induced by a short (600 msec) application of taurine (I<sub>Tau</sub>) on isolated rat pyramidal neurons. pH of taurine solution in the applicator pipette was neutral (7.4) or acidic (7.0-5.0). Application of protons to a neuron causes a dosedependent decrease in the peak amplitude and acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. Addition of 100 nM beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) to the perfusate caused acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. The effects of Abeta and H<sup>+</sup> on the rate of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization were not additive. In addition, Abeta attenuated the effect of H<sup>+</sup> on the peak amplitude of I<sub>Tau</sub>. We also studied the effect of protons on the chloride current caused by activation of GABA receptors. In contrast to H<sup>+</sup> effects on GlyR, Abeta did not modulate the effects of H<sup>+</sup> on GABA receptors."

Result(s): Between January 2005-August 2009 136 pts were accrued, 129 (75 males, 54 females) were evaluable. Median age was 49 years, 91% had a Zubrod score 0-1 and 69%, 25% and 6% of pts had 3,4 and 5 high risk factors respectively. With a median follow-up time of 4.1 yrs, minimum follow-up of 3 yrs, MST has not yet been reached. Three year OS rate was 73.1% (95%CI:65.3-80.8%), significantly improved from historical control with a p-value <0.0001. No difference in OS rates for pts with 3, 4 or 5 high risk factors was seen. 3 year PFS was 59.2% (95% CI:50.7-67.8%).

Method(s): Unfors Multi-O-Meter equipment was used to measure the entrance surface at the thyroid region of adult patients ranging from 18 to 70 years of age. A total of 115 patients were included in the study based on convenience sampling. The Multi-O-Meter was kept at the thyroid region during the scan, and the values for entrance surface dose (ESD) were noted from its monitor after the scan was complete. Result(s): The obtained data were analyzed and violate normal distribution; therefore, the median and quartiles were computed. The overall median (Q1, Q2), ESD of the patients, was 1.335 (1.213, 1.529) mGy. The minimum and maximum dose values recorded were 1.015 mGy and 1.964 mGy, respectively.

Intense physiological light upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in retinal pigment epithelium, independent of circadian rhythm, which resulted in enhancement of choroidal neovascularization. In rd1/rd1 mice or Crx(-/-) mice that do not possess outer segment structure, light exposure did not induce VEGF, indicating that VEGF upregulation by light depended on increased outer segment phagocytosis by retinal pigment epithelium. In retinal pigment epithelium cells phagocytosing increased amount of outer segment, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) not hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was induced, leading to VEGF upregulation. The VEGF upregulation and choroidal neovascularization enhancement were abrogated in PGC-1alpha(-/-) mice and estrogen-related receptor-alpha(-/-) mice, indicating the involvement of PGC-1alpha/estrogen-related receptor-alpha pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Intense physiological light is involved in choroidal neovascularization through excess outer segment phagocytosis and VEGF upregulation mediated by PGC-1alpha in vivo."

No effect of irradiation on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes was observed. Previously it was shown that, on exposure to gamma-rays, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylglycerol, as opposed to phosphatidylcholine, broke down into fragments of lower molecular weight.

The aim of this study was to determine the relation between changes in myelin basic protein (MBP) levels during the acute and subacute phases of central nervous system injury following whole-brain radiation and delayed demyelination in the radiation-injured brain tissue. Methods. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with single fractions of 2, 10, or 30 Gy of whole-brain radiation. The authors measured MBP gene expression and protein levels in the brain tissue by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 week and 1-3 months following irradiation to monitor myelin changes in the brain. Demyelination was determined with Luxol fast blue myelin staining and routine histopathological and electron microscopy examination of injured brain tissue. The changes in MBP levels in the different animal groups at specific time points were correlated with demyelination in corresponding dose groups. Results. At 1 month after applying the 10 and 30 Gy of radiation, MBP mRNA expression showed a transient but significant decrease, followed by recovery to baseline levels at 3 months after treatment. The MBP levels were decreased by only 70-75% at 1 month after 10 and 30 Gy of radiation. At 2-3 months after applying the higher dose of 30 Gy, however, the MBP levels continued to decline, and typical demyelination changes were observed with myelin staining and ultrastructural examination. Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that the early radiation-induced MBP changes between 1 and 3 months af ter single treatments of 10 and 30 Gy of radiation to the whole brain are indicative of permanent injury shown as de myelination of irradiated brain tissue."

828,Excluded,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction. Conclusion(s): Notable incensements of AE were not observed during and after RT for ABS. This study clarified that standard dose RT prescription can be administered safely to ABS with cancer even though they received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb before half century."

The etiology of the stenosis was probably atherosclerosis, except in 1 case due to fibro-muscular dysplasia, 1 with post-radiation angiopathy and 2 related to oral contraceptives. Two main clinical groups were delineated: 1) transitory and minor ischemic accidents always arising in the same arterial area; these occurred in older patients with multiples atheromatous lesions along the carotid artery. 2) progressive--or stepwise--strokes occurring in younger patients, mainly females, with isolated MCA stenosis. These cerebrovascular symptoms and signs, in the absence of carotid bruit, Doppler ultrasonography abnormality or evidence of cardiac embolism should suggest intracranial stenosis and require appropriate therapy to avoid complete occlusion. Our study shows that early medical treatment--anti-coagulation, then antiaggregation--provides a suitable alternative to EC/IC bypass. This is suggested by evidence for micro-embolization in addition to hemodynamic mechanisms."

We developed a method of response waveform comparison (RWC) for evaluating the effective intensity of the light pulses. We identified one UV, four violet-blue, two green and two red photoreceptor classes. We estimated the peak wavelengths of four rhodopsins to be at about 360, 420, 460 and 560 nm. The four violet-blue classes are presumably based on combinations of two rhodopsins and a violet-absorbing screening pigment. The green classes have reduced sensitivity in the ultraviolet range. The two red classes have primary peaks at about 650 and 665 nm, respectively, and secondary peaks at about 480 nm. The shift of the main peak, so far the largest amongst insects, is presumably achieved by tuning the effective thickness of the red perirhabdomal screening pigment. Polarisation sensitivity of green and red photoreceptors is higher at the secondary than at the main peak. We found a 20-fold variation of sensitivity within the cells of one green class, implying possible photoreceptor subfunctionalisation. We propose an allocation scheme of the receptor classes into the three ventral ommatidial types."

Cells exposed to a priming dose of X-rays and then exposed immediately to a series of neutron doses regard the X-ray dose as equivalent to a neutron dose giving the same surviving fraction (iso-effective). If the cells are exposed to a neutron dose followed by X-rays the resulting survival is higher than would be obtained if the primary dose had been an iso-effective X-ray dose. However, it is lower than would be expected if the two radiations acted independently. The results imply that there is interaction between the damage caused by X-rays and fast neurons.

Method(s): We analyzed 293 patients with SCLC without brain metastases who received chemotherapy, thoracic radiation therapy (TRT), or both in 2001-2015. Pretreatment hematologic markers (platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase) and other clinical characteristics were evaluated for correlation with brain metastases-free survival (BMFS). Cutoffs were established with receiver operating characteristics curves. Factors significant in univariate analysis were used to build a multivariate Cox model for BMFS. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 14.3 months. Brain metastases developed in 115 patients (39%)-32% of those with low pretreatment platelet counts (PPC) (<=270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and 46% of those with high PPC (>270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Median BMFS time for all patients was 27.9 months. Two-year BMFS rates were worse for patients with high PPC (14.6% vs. 22.1% low, P = 0.009). High PPC was independently associated with inferior BMFS (P = 0.038), as were receipt of TRT <45 Gy and no prophylactic cranial irradiation (both P < 0.001).

Hydrophone transducers were implanted in the models to record the microwave-induced mechanical vibrations. Four properly timed radar pulses produced a threefold increase in the acoustical amplitudes in the muscle model.

The radiobiologic parameters that characterized the dose-response survival curve for these cells were found to be n = 1.9, Dq = 140 rad, and D0 = 190 rad. Morphologically, nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation of cytoplasm, and giant cell formation occurred in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours from irradiation. Decreased staining intensity for F VIII RAg was observed in morphologically affected cells. The capacity to synthesize PGI2 was significantly enhanced at 24 hours, but less significant at 72 hours after irradiation. The present data suggest that the radiosensitivity of brain capillary endothelial cells may be somewhat lower than that of endothelial cells originated from larger vessels, and that radiation induced morphological and functional changes in the brain capillary endothelial cells may be quantitatively similar to the changes in endothelial cells of larger vessels."

The functional roles and precise areas of termination of these axons have been a subject of recent controversy. The goals of this study were to identify spinothalamic tract neurons (STT) within the cervical enlargement that project to this area, characterize their responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of their receptive fields, and use microantidromic tracking methods to determine the nuclei in which their axons terminate. Forty-seven neurons were antidromically activated using low-amplitude (< or =30 microA) current pulses in the contralateral posterior thalamus. The 51 points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were surrounded by ineffective tracks indicating that the surrounded axons terminated within the posterior thalamus. The areas of termination were located primarily in the posterior triangular, medial geniculate, posterior and posterior intralaminar, and suprageniculate nuclei. Recording points were located in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. The mean antidromic conduction velocity was 6.4 m/s, a conduction velocity slower than that of other projections to the thalamus or hypothalamus in rats. Cutaneous receptive fields appeared to be smaller than those of neurons projecting to other areas of the thalamus or to the hypothalamus. Each of the examined neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the STT carries nociceptive information to several target nuclei within the posterior thalamus. We discuss the evidence that this projection provides nociceptive information that plays an important role in fear conditioning."

Method(s): This study is based on the ongoing project Epidemiological Investigation of MS (EIMS) which is a population-based case-control study, comprising the general population aged 16-70 years in defined areas of Sweden. The present analysis involved 1404 incident cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) and 3097 controls, randomly selected from the study base, with consideration taken to age, gender, and residential area. The incidence of MS among people who reported high intake of fatty fish the last five years before inclusion in the study was compared with the incidence among people who reported low fatty fish intake. Adjustments were made for education level, smoking status, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure habits, body mass index (BMI), vitamin D intake from dairy products and intake of lean fish. We performed sub group analyses stratifying for sun exposure habits, ancestry and gender. Finding(s): Subjects who reported fatty fish intake 1-7 times per week had a slightly decreased risk of multiple sclerosis compared with subjects who reported less intake of fatty fish (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.1). In subgroup analyses among subjects who reported low UVR exposure, frequent fatty fish intake significantly decreased the risk of multiple sclerosis (adjusted OR 0.6 (95 CI 0.5-0.9), whereas among subjects who reported high UVR exposure, this was not seen (adjusted OR 1.1 95% CI 0.8-1.4). Interpretation(s): Fatty fish intake seems to decrease multiple sclerosis risk among people with low UVR light exposure. A hypothetical explanation is that intake of fatty fish, with relatively high vitamin D content, is a substitute for lack of vitamin D due to low UVR exposure. This gives further strength to the hypothesis of the importance of vitamin D for the development of multiple sclerosis.

3024,Excluded,"Effects of gambogic acid on the activation of caspase-3 and downregulation of SIRT1 in RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma cells via the accumulation of ROS Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most commonly diagnosed hematologic malignancy. Although new drugs, including bortezomib and lenalidomide, have improved the treatment landscape for MM patients, MM remains incurable. Therefore, screening for novel anti-myeloma drugs is necessary. Gambogic acid (GA), the main active ingredient of gamboges secreted from the Garcinia hanburryi tree, has been reported to exhibit potent anticancer activity in certain solid tumors and hematological malignancies, while there are few studies that are available concerning its effects on MM cells. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer activity of GA on the MM RPMI-8226 cells and further studied the underlying mechanisms by which GA affected the cells. RPMI-8226 cells were cultured and the effect of GA on cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT assay. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to visualize nuclear fragmentation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected. GA was found to have a significant, dose-dependent effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in RPMI-8226 cells. This activity is associated with the accumulation of ROS, which contributes to the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), accompanied with apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells treated with GA. Mammalian SIRT1, as the closest homolog of the yeast Sir2, was extensively involved in regulating cell processes, including cell senescence, aging and neuronal protection, as well as having anti-apoptotic properties. Moreover, SIRT1 overexpression has been shown to protect cancer cells from chemotherapy and ionizing radiation. In the present study, we demonstrated that GA has the potential to downregulate the expression of SIRT1 via ROS accumulation. In conclusion, our study found that GA is able to induce apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells via ROS accumulation followed by caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and SIRT1 downregulation. These results suggest that GA may have the potential to not only induce apoptosis in MM cells, but also to decrease the relapse rate of MM."

1176,Excluded,"Optical clearing potential of immersion-based agents applied to thick mouse brain sections We have previously demonstrated that the use of a commercially-available immersion-based optical clearing agent (OCA) enables, within 3-6 hours, three-dimensional visualization of subsurface exogenous fluorescent and absorbing markers of vascular architecture and neurodegenerative disease in thick (0.5-1.0mm) mouse brain sections. Nonetheless, the relative performance of immersion-based OCAs has remained unknown. Here, we show that immersion of brain sections in specific OCAs (FocusClear, RIMS, sRIMS, or ScaleSQ) affects both their transparency and volume; the optical clearing effect occurs over the entire visible spectrum and is reversible; and that ScaleSQ had the highest optical clearing potential and increase in imaging depth of the four evaluated OCAs, albeit with the largest change in sample volume and a concomitant decrease in apparent microvascular density of the sample. These results suggest a rational, quantitative framework for screening and characterization of the impact of optical clearing, to streamline experimental design and enable a cost-benefit assessment."
187,Included,"Cerebrovascular diseases incidence and mortality in an extended Mayak Worker Cohort 1948-1982 Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) codes: 430-438] was studied in a cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1982 and followed up to the end of 2008. The cohort size was increased by 19% and follow-up extended by 3 years over the previous analysis. Radiation doses were estimated using an updated dosimetry system: Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time, in an analysis of this cohort, quantitative smoking data were used. Workers of the study cohort were exposed occupationally to prolonged external gamma rays and internal alpha particles. The mean (+/-standard deviation) total dose from external gamma rays was 0.54 +/- 0.76 Gy (95% percentile 2.21 Gy) for males and 0.44 +/- 0.65 Gy (95% percentile 1.87 Gy) for females. The mean plutonium body burden in the 31% of workers monitored for internal exposure was 1.32 +/- 4.87 kBq (95% percentile 4.71 kBq) for males and 2.21 +/- 13.24 kBq (95% percentile 4.56 kBq) for females. The mean total absorbed alpha-particles dose to the liver from incorporated plutonium was 0.23 +/- 0.77 Gy (95% percentile 0.89 Gy) in males and 0.44 +/- 2.11 Gy (95% percentile 1.25 Gy) in females. After adjusting for nonradiation factors (gender, age, calendar period, employment period, facility, smoking, alcohol consumption), there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence associated with total absorbed dose from external gamma rays and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal alpha-particle radiation exposure. Excess relative risks per Gy (ERR/Gy) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.37, 0.57) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16, 0.42), respectively, based on a linear dose-response model. Adjustments for additional factors (hypertension, body mass index, duration of employment, smoking index and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal exposure during the analysis of external exposure and vice versa) had little effect on the results. The categorical analyses showed that CVD incidence was significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses and that CVD incidence was also significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-particle doses to the liver from incorporated plutonium greater than 0.01 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. The results of the categorical analyses of CVD incidence were in good agreement with a linear dose response for external gamma-ray doses but for internal alpha-particle doses the picture was less clear. For the first time an excess risk of CVD mortality was seen in workers whose livers were exposed to internal alpha-particle doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those workers who were exposed to doses of less than 0.01 Gy. A significant increasing trend for CVD mortality with internal alpha-particle dose was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed at doses <1.0 Gy after having adjusted for nonradiation factors, ERR/Gy = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.09, 1.92). These updated results provide good evidence for a linear trend in risk of CVD incidence with external gamma-ray dose. The trend for CVD incidence with internal alpha-particle dose is less clear due to the impact of issues concerning the use of dose estimates based on below the limit of detection bioassay measurements."
1360,Included,"Effects of Radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma: a retrospective analysis of a Single Institution BACKGROUND: Palliative irradiation of osteolytic lesions is a considerable component in the treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of irradiation in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with multiple myeloma who were admitted to our department between 1989 and 2013. According to the staging system of Durie & Salmon 116 patients were classified as stage III. 107/153 patients were treated with radiotherapy of at least one and up to 6 bony lesions at different times. In order to evaluate the effect of local radiotherapy on pain relief and bone recalcification a uni- and multivariate analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model to correct for multiple measurements. Complete information on dose, fractionation and volume of radiotherapy was available from 81 patients treated in 136 target volumes for pain relief, and from 69 patients treated in 108 target volumes for recalcification. Total radiation doses varied between 8 Gy to 50 Gy (median dose 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions, 5 times a week).RESULTS: Radiotherapy resulted in complete local pain relief in 31% and partial local pain relief in 54% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, higher total radiation doses (p = 0.023) and higher age (p = 0.014) at the time of radiotherapy were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of pain relief, whereas no significant association was detected for concurrent systemic treatment, type and stage of myeloma and location of bone lesions. The same variables were independent predictors for pain relief in the multivariate analysis. Recalcification was observed in 48% of irradiated bone lesions. In the uni- and multivariate analysis higher radiation doses were significantly associated (p = 0.048) with an increased likelihood of recalcification. Side effects of radiotherapy were generally mild.CONCLUSIONS: Higher total biological radiation doses were associated with better pain relief and recalcification in this retrospective evaluation of multiple myeloma patients. In addition, in the elderly the therapeutic measures appear to develop a better analgesic effect."
2721,Excluded,"Biophysical properties of the synucleins and their propensities to fibrillate: inhibition of alpha-synuclein assembly by beta- and gamma-synucleins The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the presence of intracellular inclusions, Lewy bodies, and Lewy neurites, in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and several other brain regions. Filamentous alpha-synuclein is the major component of these deposits and its aggregation is believed to play an important role in Parkinson's disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases. Two homologous proteins, beta- and gamma-synucleins, are also abundant in the brain. The synucleins are natively unfolded proteins. beta-Synuclein, which lacks 11 central hydrophobic residues compared with its homologs, exhibited the properties of a random coil, whereas alpha- and gamma-synucleins were slightly more compact and structured. gamma-Synuclein, unlike its homologs, formed a soluble oligomer at relatively low concentrations, which appears to be an off-fibrillation pathway species. Here we show that, although they have similar biophysical properties to alpha-synuclein, beta- And gamma-synucleins inhibit alpha-synuclein fibril formation. Complete inhibition of alpha-synuclein fibrillation was observed at 4:1 molar excess of beta- and gamma-synucleins. No significant incorporation of beta-synuclein into the fibrils was detected. The lack of fibrils formed by beta-synuclein is most readily explained by the absence of a stretch of hydrophobic residues from the middle region of the protein. A model for the inhibition is proposed."

A 70-yr-old male with history of radiosurgery for AVM presented with aphasia and confusion. Preoperative angiography showed complete occlusion of the AVM. MRI showed multiple cystic lesions suspicious for radiation-induced necrosis and CM. IRB approval and patient consent was obtained. A pterional craniotomy was performed with transsylvian exposure of the insula. The radiated feeding arteries were followed to the occluded AVM nidus. A CM was noted deep to this candelabra of the MCA vessels, which were mobilized to access and resect the CM. A small incision was made in this insular cortex underneath the malformation circumferentially freeing it of adhesions. The sclerotic AVM nidus was circumferentially dissected and removed en bloc. Thorough exploration of the resection cavity revealed no residual CM or AVM nidus. Attention was then turned to the M2-MCA bifurcation aneurysm, which was occluded with a straight clip. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete CM resection. The patient recovered from his aphasia. This case demonstrates the management of a radiation-induced de novo CM following treatment of a high-grade AVM. Radiographic follow-up for radiosurgically treated AVM is needed to rule out long-term complications. Bleeding from a de novo CM mimics bleeding from residual AVM nidus, requiring careful angiographic evaluation. Copyright Â© 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved."
2901,Excluded,"Research progress on mechanism and dosimetry of brainstem injury induced by intensity-modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, and heavy ion radiotherapy Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective method for treating head and neck cancer (HNC). However, RT may cause side effects during and after treatment. Radiation-induced brainstem injury (BSI) is often neglected due to its low incidence and short survival time and because it is indistinguishable from intracranial tumor progression. It is currently believed that the possible mechanism of radiation-induced BSI includes increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and damage of vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and glial cells as well as an inflammatory response and oxidative stress. At present, it is still difficult to avoid BSI even with several advanced RT techniques. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is the most commonly used therapeutic technique in the field of RT. Compared with early conformal therapy, it has greatly reduced the injury to normal tissues. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) and heavy ion radiotherapy (HIT) have good dose distribution due to the presence of a Bragg peak, which not only results in better control of the tumor but also minimizes the dose to the surrounding normal tissues. There are many clinical studies on BSI caused by IMRT, PBT, and HIT. In this paper, we review the mechanism, dosimetry, and other aspects of BSI caused by IMRT, PBT, and HIT.Key Points* Enhanced MRI imaging can better detect radiation-induced BSI early.* This article summarized the dose constraints of brainstem toxicity in clinical studies using different techniques including IMRT, PBT, and HIT and recommended better dose constraints pattern to clinicians.* The latest pathological mechanism of radiation-induced BSI and the corresponding advanced treatment methods will be discussed."

All the patients were refractory to anticholinergic agents. Under sedation or local anaesthesia, BoNT-A was injected through a cystoscope into 20 sites submucosally in the trigone and floor of the bladder.RESULTS: There were no side-effects or retention after BoNT-A injection. In five of the six patients with radiation cystitis there was a moderate to significant improvement; the mean (sd) bladder capacity increased from 105 (25) mL to 250 (35) mL and the urinary frequency decreased from 14 (2) to 11 (1) episodes per day. In the two patients with BCG cystitis both reported significant symptomatic improvement; the mean (sd) bladder capacity increased from 110 (23) to 230 (23) mL, the urinary frequency decreased from 16 (1) to 12 (1) episodes per day, and using a 10-point visual analogue pain scoring system, the perceived pain score decreased from 8 to 2. Microscopically, the bladder tissue at 1 month after BCG injection showed marked acute and chronic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltration and focal granulomatous formation. At 2 months after BoNT-A injection, there was only a mild degree of chronic inflammation with few eosinophils.CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that BoNT-A injected into the bladder is a promising treatment for patients with refractory radiation and BCG cystitis."
1871,Included,"YKL-40 expression is associated with poorer response to radiation and shorter overall survival in glioblastoma PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors."
3093,Excluded,"Effects of irradiation on brain vasculature using an in situ tumor model PURPOSE: Damage to normal tissue is a limiting factor in clinical radiotherapy (RT). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane matrix absent of tumor cells.RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance. Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with and without radiation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation."

A case of post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma in a young Chinese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus is described here. She presented with right-sided weakness and memory loss after tooth extraction 2 weeks before admission. Contrast computed tomography of the brain demonstrated a contrast rim-enhancing lesion over the left frontal lobe. With a history of recent dental procedure, long-term immunosuppressive therapy and computed tomography findings, cerebral abscess was highly suspected. Emergency operation was performed. Histopathology showed post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma, with cells positive for B-cell marker CD20. Immunosuppressant was stopped and she was treated with radiotherapy and rituximab (anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody). She remained diseasefree at 16 months. Post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma is rare with variable presentation and radiological features. We believe rituximab may have a role in the treatment of such lymphomas.

According to the therapy modality, patients were allocated to PCI group and non-PCI group. Result(s): A total of 193 patients were finally included, 67 patients in PCI group and 126 in non-PCI group. The OS rates at 2-year and 5-year in PCI group were 92.5%, and 54.9%, respectively, and those of non-PCI were 63.2% and 47.8%, respectively (. p=. 0.005). The BMFS rate at 2-year and 5-year in PCI group was significantly better than those of non-PCI group (96.8%, 76.6% and 79.4%, 75.5%, respectively, p=. 0.014). But PCI could not confer survival benefit in the patients with p-stage I. Multivariate analysis revealed that PCI (HR. =. 2.339; p=. 0.001) was an independent prognostic factor of the overall survival.

444,Excluded,"A novel high-resolution in vivo imaging technique to study the dynamic response of intracranial structures to tumor growth and therapeutics We have successfully integrated previously established Intracranial window (ICW) technology (1-4) with intravital 2-photon confocal microscopy to develop a novel platform that allows for direct long-term visualization of tissue structure changes intracranially. Imaging at a single cell resolution in a real-time fashion provides supplementary dynamic information beyond that provided by standard end-point histological analysis, which looks solely at 'snap-shot' cross sections of tissue. Establishing this intravital imaging technique in fluorescent chimeric mice, we are able to image four fluorescent channels simultaneously. By incorporating fluorescently labeled cells, such as GFP+ bone marrow, it is possible to track the fate of these cells studying their long-term migration, integration and differentiation within tissue. Further integration of a secondary reporter cell, such as an mCherry glioma tumor line, allows for characterization of cell:cell interactions. Structural changes in the tissue microenvironment can be highlighted through the addition of intra-vital dyes and antibodies, for example CD31 tagged antibodies and Dextran molecules. Moreover, we describe the combination of our ICW imaging model with a small animal micro-irradiator that provides stereotactic irradiation, creating a platform through which the dynamic tissue changes that occur following the administration of ionizing irradiation can be assessed. Current limitations of our model include penetrance of the microscope, which is limited to a depth of up to 900 mum from the sub cortical surface, limiting imaging to the dorsal axis of the brain. The presence of the skull bone makes the ICW a more challenging technical procedure, compared to the more established and utilized chamber models currently used to study mammary tissue and fat pads (5-7). In addition, the ICW provides many challenges when optimizing the imaging."

[Russian] A study was made of Wistar male rats with the body mass of 250-270 g using neurohistological, electron microscopic and biochemical methods. The animals' heads were irradiated with gamma-quanta at a dose of 50 Gy, the rate of 6.7 cGy/s. Two minutes before or right after irradiation 15% ethanol solution (0.28 and 2.25 g/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. It was established that changes of interneuronal contacts in gamma-irradiation of the head were similar in nature to those caused by ethanol (2.25 g/kg). The effects of combined action of the above factors depended on the succession of exposure and a dose of ethanol. Slightly more noticeable synaptic changes, probably associated with mitochondrion affection and hyperhydration, were noted in ethanol administration (2.25 g/kg) after irradiation of the head."

The control group did not receive Zn or irradiation but received 1-ml saline orally plus sham-irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The IR plus Zn group received irradiation to total cranium plus 10 mg/kg/day Zn intraperitoneally. Biochemical parameters measured in rat lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens total (enzymatic plus non-enzymatic) superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), glutathione reductase (GRD), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities significantly increased in the IR plus Zn groups when compared with the IR group. However, TSSA, GRD and GST activities were significantly lower in the IR group when compared with the control group. Lens non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) in the IR plus Zn group was significantly increased compared to that of the IR group. Lens xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the IR group significantly increased compared to that of both the control and IR plus Zn groups.CONCLUSION: Zn has clear antioxidant properties and prevented oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals generated by ionizing radiation in rat lenses."
894,Excluded,"Disruption of the prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex in vasopressin V1b receptor knockout mice: reversal by antipsychotic drugs In the present study, we investigated whether mice lacking the arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1b receptor (V1bR) exhibit deficits of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, reminiscent of the sensorimotor gating deficits observed in a large majority of schizophrenic patients. V1bR knockout (KO) mice displayed significantly reduced levels of PPI of the startle reflex. In addition to PPI deficits, V1bR KO mice showed increased acoustic startle response. However, acoustic startle response was not significantly correlated to the PPI of the startle reflex in V1bR KO mice. V1bR KO mice also showed a decrease in basal levels of extracellular dopamine (DA) in the medial prefrontal cortex, which is thought to be an important brain region for PPI. Moreover, PPI deficits observed in the V1bR KO mice are significantly reversed by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and clozapine but not by a typical neuroleptic haloperidol, like in schizophrenic patients. By contrast, we did not observe any significant differences between V1bR KO mice and wild-type mice in the open-field, light/dark, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests. The results of the present study indicate that V1bR may be involved in the regulation of PPI of the startle reflex. The V1bR has been considered an important molecular target for the development of antipsychotic drugs."

1273,Included,"Space radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and memory impairment in mice: ameliorative potential of the melatonin metabolite, AFMK Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain."

2910,Excluded,"Contribution of the Atm protein to maintaining cellular homeostasis evidenced by continuous activation of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient brains Maintenance of genome stability is essential for keeping cellular homeostasis. The DNA damage response is a central component in maintaining genome integrity. Among of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions are double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. ATM is missing or inactivated in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a pleiotropic phenotype and suffer primarily from progressive ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. Additional features are immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that exhibits most of the clinical features of the human disease but very mild neuronal abnormality. The ATM protein is a multifunctional protein kinase, which serves as a master regulator of cellular responses to DSBs. There is growing evidence that ATM may be involved in addition to the DSB response in other processes that maintain processes in cellular homeostasis. For example, mounting evidence points to increased oxidative stress in the absence of ATM. Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in the brains of Atm-deficient mice not treated with DNA damaging agents. A canonical activation (increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) of the AP-1 pathway was found in Atm-deficient cerebra, whereas induction of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient cerebella is likely to mediate elevated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun. Although Atm(+/+) mice are capable of responding to ionizing radiation by activating stress responses such as the AP-1 pathway, Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. Our results further demonstrate that inactivation of the ATM gene results in a state of constant stress."
1725,Excluded,"UV-visible antagonism in extraocular photosensitive neurons of the anthomedusa, Spirocodon saltatrix (Tilesius) Attempts were made to identify extraocular photosensitive cells in the subtentacular region (the area between the ocelli and the nerve ring) and around the inner-nerve ring of the anthomedusan Spirocodon saltatrix. Irradiation with ultraviolet light (UV) led to inhibition of spontaneous impulses and after UV-off, an afterinhibition which lasted for a few minutes. This afterinhibition was rapidly overcome by exposure to visible light (VIS). UV-VIS antagonism of this type was identified in six different impulse systems monitored in extracellular recordings. Intracellular recordings from two of the six cell types showed that UV irradiation causes hyperpolarization which inhibits spontaneous activity. The other cell types showed no membrane potential changes during UV irradiation even though the cells' spontaneous outputs were inhibited. It was concluded that the photosensitivity lies in three kinds of nerves which are distributed widely through the subtentacular region and the nerve ring."
3045,Excluded,"CT perfusion study of vascular response to stereotactic radiosurgery in a preclinical model of glioma PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute changes in tumor and normal brain perfusion following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using computed tomography (CT) perfusion. METHOD(S): C6 glioma cells were implanted into the right caudate nuclei of five Wistar rats. Each rat was treated with 12 Gy of SRS using helical tomotherapy and underwent a CT perfusion scan on day 1 pre-SRS and day 5 post-SRS. Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and permeability-surface area product (PS) were calculated from the CT perfusion studies. After rigid image registrations, the post-SRS CT perfusion maps were subtracted from the pre-SRS CT perfusion maps to produce CBF, CBV, and PS difference maps. Using Otsu's method, we categorized the voxels in the tumor and the peritumoral brain on the PS difference maps as regions of 1) substantial decrease, 2) modest change, and 3) substantial increase. Statistical differences in these regions and in the contralateral brain before and after SRS were tested using the paired t-test. RESULT(S): Using helical tomotherapy, 12 Gy of radiation could be delivered to the tumor, whereas the brainstem dose was < 4 Gy, and < 10% of the contralateral brain received >8 Gy. A significant decrease in PS was observed in voxels that were categorized as ""substantial decrease"" (p = 0.03), and these voxels corresponded to the tumor. We observed a marginally significant increase in PS and CBV (p = 0.07 and 0.08, respectively) in voxels of ""substantial increase,"" and these voxels corresponded to the peritumoral region. No perfusion difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the contralateral brain. CONCLUSION(S): Using CT perfusion, an acute differential vascular response to SRS was observed in the tumor and the peritumoral regions. This finding supports the contention that SRS effects may be mediated in part through the vascular effects of radiation."

There are four types of cone visual pigments and a single type of rod visual pigment. The reaction process of the rod visual pigment, rhodopsin, has been extensively investigated, whereas there have been few studies of cone visual pigments. Here we comprehensively investigated the reaction processes of cone visual pigments on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes, using flash photolysis equipment optimized for cone visual pigment photochemistry. We used chicken violet (L-group), chicken blue (M1-group), chicken green (M2-group), and monkey green (L-group) visual pigments as representatives of the respective groups of the phylogenetic tree of cone pigments. The S, M1, and M2 pigments showed the formation of a pH-dependent mixture of meta intermediates, similar to that formed from rhodopsin. Although monkey green (L-group) also formed a mixture of meta intermediates, pH dependency of meta intermediates was not observed. However, meta intermediates of monkey green became pH dependent when the chloride ion bound to the monkey green was replaced with a nitrate ion. These results strongly suggest that rhodopsin and S, M1, and M2 cone visual pigments share a molecular mechanism for activation, whereas the L-group pigment may have a special reaction mechanism involving the chloride-binding site."
2574,Included,"Acquisition of radioresistance by IL-6 treatment is caused by suppression of oxidative stress derived from mitochondria after gamma-irradiation Interleukin (IL)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and is one of the radiation-induced bystander factors. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of acquisition of radioresistance through the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by IL-6. We used a rat glioma cell line (C6) as tumor cells and a rat astrocyte cell line (RNB) as non-tumor cells. Our results showed that the surviving fraction of C6 cells after 6 Gy irradiation was increased by the addition of IL-6, but that this was not the case in RNB cells. In addition, the number of 53BP1 foci in C6 cells at 30 min after gamma-irradiation were decreased by IL-6. Levels of ROS in whole C6 cells, and superoxide in the mitochondria of C6 cells immediately after gamma-irradiation, were reduced by IL-6, but this was not observed in RNB cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 in C6 and RNB cells was inhibited by IL-6 alone. Therefore, it was concluded that IL-6 leads specifically to radioresistance in tumor cells by inhibition of increases in ROS after gamma-irradiation."

Experimental models suggest that these resistant cancer cells undergo dormancy transition that is best targeted with a stemness modulator in its activation window through a strategy that we call ADAPT: Activating (CSC) from Dormancy And Potentiate for Targeting. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that 5FU activates while celecoxib inhibits and depletes these putative colorectal CSC. We retrospectively administer three year ADAPT therapy in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients using capecitabine and celecoxib +/- radiation following maximal responses (complete (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)) to first-line combination chemotherapy. ADAPT therapy led to 30% CR and additional 10% surgical CR whose median survival reached 92.7 months in patients with unresectable MCRC. (Lin et al AACR 2010 LB-254). Method(s): Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center institutional review board (IRB) approved this prospective phase II ADAPT study funded by Gateway for Cancer Cure in October 2013.

Many agents have been used for neuroprotection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible protective role of royal jelly on radiationinduced brain damage. Design(s): In the present study, thirty-two adult male Dawley rats, 8-12 weeks of age and weighing 275+/-35 grams were randomly divided into four groups each group compressed eight animals: group 1: control (C), group 2: irradiated rats (RT), group 3: irradiated rats with oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 days (RT+RJ50), group 4: oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 day (RJ50). Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation delivered to total cranium. Royal jelly was administered before and after irradiation per day for 7 days. At the seventh day of study, when rats were under ketamine anesthesia samples of brain tissues were taken and biochemical and microscopic examination after sacrification. Result(s): An increase in brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (P<0.001) were detected while significant decreases in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (P<0.001) in irradiation alone group when compared to control group. Increases in MDA were relatively well prevented by royal jelly. The administration of RJ increased to activity of SOD and CAT enzymes and decreased MDA level in the brain tissue (p<0.001). On histopathological examination, royal jelly reduced edema, necrosis, vasodilation and neuronal degeneration. Conclusion(s): The results obtained from this study demonstrated that with royal jelly prevented the damage that develops in brain following irradiation. The beneficial effect of royal jelly can be related to protection of the brain from oxidative injury."

The present study was undertaken to investigate the pretreatment effects of standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation on the neurological dysfunction in the reserpine model of PD. Male Wistar rats were pretreated orally with EGb761 or fractionated low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation or their combination, then subjected to intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h after the final dose of EGb761 or radiation. Reserpine injection resulted in the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) level, increased catalepsy score, increased oxidative stress indicated via depletion of glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron levels, decreased DA metabolites metabolizing enzymes; indicated by inhibition by glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) activities, mitochondrial dysfunction; indicated by declined complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and increased apoptosis; indicated by decreased mitochondrial B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein level and by transmission electron microscope. EGb761 and low-dose gamma-radiation ameliorated the reserpine-induced state of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in brain. It can be concluded that EGb761, a widely used herbal medicine and low dose of gamma-irradiation have protective effects for combating Parkinsonism possibly via replenishment of GSH levels.

1152,Excluded,"Monitoring the upper tracts in neurogenic bladder dysfunction Altered bladder physiology as a result of neuromuscular disease may exert a profound influence on upper urinary tract function. Upper urinary tract abnormalities may occur in these patients in the absence of symptomatology and a systematic program of long-term surveillance is required. Monitoring the upper urinary tract to detect abnormalities that would require an alteration in bladder management is likely one of the key factors that has resulted in the decreased morbidity and mortality in neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Excretory urography, comprehensive renal scintillation procedures, and renal ultrasound examinations all have played a role in monitoring upper urinary tract dysfunction. Cystourethrography has been utilized to detect vesicoureteral reflux. Comprehensive renal scintillation procedures have some distinct advantages over excretory urography, including lack of adverse reactions, lack of need for bowel preparation and dehydration, and lower radiation exposure. These factors have improved patient compliance in returning for follow-up examinations. The sensitivity of the comprehensive renal scintillation procedure has allowed it to replace the excretory urogram, the cystourethrogram, and serum creatinine as monitors of upper urinary tract function at our institution. Renal ultrasound examinations have been utilized recently by some investigators and results compare favorably with excretory urography. We are currently evaluating the renal ultrasound examination against the comprehensive renal scintillation procedure and excretory urography to determine its future role for upper urinary tract screening in neurogenic bladder dysfunction."

1191,Included,"Identification of tumor precursor cells in the brains of primates with radiation-induced de novo glioblastoma multiforme The pathogenesis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is poorly understood and precursor cells are not known. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development. The findings provide insight into the tumorigenesis of de novo GBMs and suggest a new strategy for treatment of these lethal tumors by targeting both inactivation of N-CoR and inhibition of EGFR."

Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy or best supportive care with respect to disease burden, patient preference and performance status. In the present case report the radiotherapy technique combining whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal sparing (hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiotherapy HA-WBRT) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of the brain metastases is performed in a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. HA-WBRT was administered to 30 Gy in 10 fractions with sparing of the hippocampal structures and SRT of 21 Gy in 3 fractions to brain metastases which has preceded the HA-WBRT. Two single arc volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) plans were prepared using Monaco planning software. The HA-WBRT treatment plan achieved the following results: D2=33.91 Gy, D98=25.20 Gy, D100=14.18 Gy, D50=31.26 Gy. The homogeneity index was calculated as a deduction of the minimum dose in 2% and 98% of the planning target volume (PTV), divided by the minimum dose in 50% of the PTV. The maximum dose to the hippocampus was 17.50 Gy and mean dose was 11.59 Gy. The following doses to organs at risk (OAR) were achieved: Right opticus Dmax, 31.96 Gy; left opticus Dmax, 30.96 Gy; chiasma D max, 32,76 Gy. The volume of PTV for stereotactic radiotherapy was 3,736 cm3, with coverage D100=20.95 Gy and with only 0.11% of the PTV being irradiated to dose below the prescribed dose. HA-WBRT with SRT represents a feasible technique for radiotherapy of brain metastatic disease, however this technique is considerably demanding on departmental equipment and staff time/experience."
1999,Included,"Interaction between age of irradiation and age of testing in the disruption of operant performance using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established."
2355,Excluded,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments.

1482,Excluded,"Benign central neurocytoma: A double misnomer? BACKGROUND. 'Central neurocytoma' is classically considered as an intraventricular benign tumor, largely based on data from small retrospective series. The authors present prospective data on 12 patients with tumors diagnosed as central neurocytoma, to highlight the diverse nature of this tumor and challenge the classic notion. METHODS. Between 1991 and 1997, 12 patients had tumors diagnosed prospectively as 'central neurocytoma'. Clinical, radiologic, and histologic data were collected, and Karnofsky performance score was evaluated for each patient. Proliferation marker studies were performed using Ki-67 labeling index. RESULTS. In two patients, the tumors were located in atypical locations, namely, the parietal lobe and the spine. Aggressive behavior characterized by clinical and radiologic evidence of tumor progression was noted in two additional patients. In both these cases, unusually high proliferation rates of 5.3% and 11.2% were noted. Total excision of the tumor, when possible, was the treatment of choice. Postoperative radiotherapy to the residual tumor may be of benefit in patients with clinically aggressive tumors, or those with high proliferation rates. CONCLUSIONS. Given the findings of this study; it is suggested that the traditional concept of central neurocytoma as a benign intraventricular tumor warrants reconsideration. (C) 2000 American Cancer Society."

However, despite significant subjective complaints, relatively good visual acuities often are obtained with high-contrast optotypes. Using Variable-Contrast Visual Acuity Charts (VCVAC), we measured visual acuities of 40 eyes of 24 normal subjects (visual acuity greater than or equal to 1.0) aged 41 to 72 years, and 40 eyes of 28 cataract patients (visual acuity greater than or equal to 0.6) aged 44 to 81 years. The VCVAC consists of 4 different charts (1-4). The contrast is 90% in charts 1 and 4, 15% in chart 2 and 2.5% in chart 3. Chart 4 is the reverse polarity of chart 1. The decrease of visual acuity compared with the high-contrast chart (chart 1) was larger in the cataract group with both in the 15% contrast (0.52 vs. 0.71 octave) and the 2.5% contrast (1.21 vs. 1.75 octaves). In cataract group, 23/40 eyes (57.5%) showed better visual acuity with chart 4 than that of chart 1.

Patients who received biopsy only were excluded. The time from surgery to initiation of radiation therapy was divided into 4 equal quartiles of <=24, 25 to 30, 31 to 37, and >37 d. Patient characteristics were compared between groups using Pearson Chi Square and Fisher's Exact test. OS was analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared via the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression were performed to assess for impact of covariables on OS.RESULTS: A total of 11 652 patients were included in the analysis. Median duration from surgery to radiation was 30 d. On multivariable regression, black race, larger tumor, gross-total resection, methyguanine-methyl transferase (MGMT+), and treatment at an academic facility were associated with a duration >30 d. On multivariable analysis, there were no significant differences when comparing start within 24 d to 25 to 30 d (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.01, P = .13) or > 37 d (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91-1.03, P = .26), although a small OS improvement was seen if initiated within 31 to 37 d (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99, P = .02).CONCLUSION: There was no clear association between duration from surgery to initiation of chemoradiation on OS."
675,Excluded,"Feasibility of tract based dosimetric analysis in brain tumor patients Purpose or Objective Radiation induced white matter injuries are feared side effects of brain irradiation that may cause cognitive dysfunction. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis is a valid tool to evaluate white matter (WM) integrity. A framework for the integrated analysis of tractographic and dosimetric data in brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy is proposed. The tool is able to simultaneously measure in specific white matter tracts the diffusion changes due to microstructural alterations and the radiation dose. Material and Methods Ten consecutive patients affected by high grade glioma were treated by conformal radiotherapy with multiple non-coplanar 6 MV photon beams from a linear accelerator with a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions of 2 Gy. Two different time-points were planned for MRI execution (before starting RT and one month after RT). Each MRI study included, beside the DTI, threedimensional T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE) before and after i.v. injection of contrast medium, as well as FLAIR and TSE-T2W images in the axial plane. The MPRAGE and the TSE-T2W images were coregistered with the b0 image and were used for the delineation of the area of parenchymal distortion (deformed area, DA). The DA included the surgical cavity and/or the area of contrast enhancement and/or the area of abnormal signal on TSE-T2W images. Deterministic fiber tracking across the whole WM was then performed using the fiber assignment continuous tracking algorithm. Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) maps were generated. A ROI-based approach was used to select the fiber tracts. All fiber tracts passing through the DA were excluded though belonging to one of the three structures considered. The fiber tracts were converted in DICOM-RT format. The MPRAGE sequences without contrast medium were used as reference images for the co-registration with the corresponding planning CT-scan. The RT structure-set files were transferred from the MRI-space into the planning CTspace using the resulting co-registration matrix. Superimposing the dose map from each patient, the dosimetric evaluation was performed. The detailed scheme of our framework is reported in Figure 1. (Figure Presented) Results The DTI analysis was successfully performed pre and post RT. Differences in FA, RD, and AD between pre and post RT MRI were assessed. The superimposition of the fiber tracts maps with the relative information about post treatment alterations on the dosimetric information of the simulation CT was finally obtained. Conclusion We show the feasibility of a standardized tract-based dosimetric analysis, potentially useful to establish possible relations between dose-volumes data and the variation of DTI indices in WM structures.

1362,Excluded,"Gamma Knife surgery for adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing pituitary adenomas after bilateral adrenalectomy OBJECT: Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas may require a bilateral adrenalectomy to treat their Cushing's disease. Approximately one third of these patients, however, will experience progressive enlargement of the residual pituitary adenoma, develop hyperpigmentation, and have an elevated level of serum ACTH. These patients with Nelson's syndrome can be treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS).METHODS: The prospectively collected University of Virginia Gamma Knife database of patients with pituitary adenomas was reviewed to identify all individuals with Nelson's syndrome who were treated with GKS. Twenty-three patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow up were identified in the database. These patients were assessed for tumor control (that is, lack of tumor growth over time) with neuroimaging studies (median follow-up duration 22 months) and for biochemical normalization of their ACTH levels (median follow-up duration 50 months). Neuroimaging follow-up studies were available for 22 patients, and endocrine follow up was available for 15 patients in whom elevation of ACTH levels was documented prior to GKS. In the 22 patients in whom neuroimaging follow-up studies were available, 12 had a decrease in tumor size, eight had no tumor growth, and two had an increase in tumor volume. Ten of 15 patients with elevated ACTH levels prior to GKS showed a decrease in their ACTH levels at last follow up; three of these 10 patients achieved normal ACTH levels (< 50 pg/ml) and the other five patients with initially elevated values had an increase in ACTH levels. Ten patients were thoroughly evaluated for post-GKS pituitary function; four were found to have new pituitary hormone deficiency and six did not have hypopituitarism after GKS. One patient suffered a permanent third cranial nerve palsy and four patients are now deceased.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery may control the residual pituitary adenoma and decrease ACTH levels in patients with Nelson's syndrome. Delayed hypopituitarism or cranial nerve palsies can occur after GKS. Patients with Nelson's syndrome require continued multidisciplinary follow-up care. Given the difficulties associated with management of Nelson's syndrome, even the modest results of GKS may be helpful for a number of patients."
1058,Included,"Protective effect of hypothermia on brain neurons of rats exposed to ionizing radiation. [Russian] The conditions of the protein-synthesizing system in neurons of the hippocampus (areas CA1 and C A3) and of the cortex (sensomotor region) in rats subjected to y-irradiation at a dose of 8 Gy under hypothermia (16 - 18 degrees C) and hypoxia-hypercapnia were investigated by fluorescent and electron microscopy. Under hypothermia, the protein-synthesizing system was shown to be damaged to a lesser degree and to be restored faster in comparison with similar neurons in rats irradiated at room temperature. In rats irradiated under hypothermia, the rRNA biogenesis and the protein-synthesizing activity of polyribosomes were restored in two days. The protective influence of hypothermia did not spread to changes in membrane structures (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgy apparatus); i.e., a partial loss of integrity and possible transformation of their structure caused by the irradiation and the restoration of these structures occurred at a lower rate."
867,Excluded,"Failure to restore vision after optic nerve regeneration in reptiles: interspecies variation in response to axotomy Optic nerve regeneration within the reptiles is variable. In a snake, Viper aspis, and the lizard Gallotia galloti, regeneration is slow, although some retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons eventually reach the visual centers (Rio et al. [1989] Brain Res 479:151-156; Lang et al. [1998] Glia 23:61-74). By contrast, in a lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus, numerous RGC axons regenerate rapidly to the visual centers, but unless animals are stimulated visually, the regenerated projection lacks topography and animals remain blind via the experimental eye (Beazley et al. [2003] J. Neurotrauma 20:1263-1269). V. aspis, G. galloti, and C. ornatus belong respectively to the Serpentes, Lacertidae, and Agamidae within the Eureptilia, the major modern group of living reptiles comprising the Squamata (snakes, lizards, and geckos) and the Crocodyllia. Here we have extended the findings on Eureptilia to include two geckos (Gekkonidae), Cehyra variegata and Nephrurus stellatus. We also examined a turtle, Chelodina oblonga, the Testudines being the sole surviving representatives of the Parareptilia, the more ancient reptilian group. In all three species, visually elicited behavioral responses were absent throughout regeneration, a result supported electrophysiologically; axonal tracing revealed that only a small proportion of RGC axons crossed the lesion and none entered the contralateral optic tract. RGC axons failed to reach the chiasm in C. oblonga, and in G. variegata, and N. stellatus RGC axons entered the opposite optic nerve; a limited ipsilateral projection was seen in G. variegata. Our results support a heterogeneous response to axotomy within the reptiles, each of which is nevertheless dysfunctional."

Patients in the treatment group were administrated pregabalin for 8 weeks combined with rehabilitation, while the control group only received rehabilitation. The clinical therapeutic effects were observed and evaluated by mandibular motion, severity of trismus measured by late effects of normal tissues/subjective and objective medical analysis (LENT/SOMA) scales, and quality of life (QOL) assessed using the World Health Organization QOL instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) at baseline, week 4 and week 8 during treatment in these two groups, respectively.RESULTS: In the treatment group, the number of patients with improvement on maximal vertical dimension (MVD) was significantly more than controls at week 4 and week 8 (P=0.013, P=0.004, respectively). Moreover, at week 4 and week 8, the severity of trismus was both significantly improved on LENT/SOMA grade in treatment group (P=0.047, P=0.032, respectively). And at week 8, the physical health and the whole life domain of the WHOQOL-BREF score were significantly increased (P=0.037, P=0.034, respectively). In the treatment group, 11 patients (36.7%) presented dizziness, and 7 patients (23.3%) presented somnolence.CONCLUSIONS: Administration of pregabalin, in adjunct to rehabilitation, might provide a better outcome in patients with radiotherapy-induced trismus."
1611,Excluded,"Necessity of repeat head computed tomography (CT) scans in mild traumatic brain injury patients INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical TBI severity grading system. CT scanning has also become a sensitive diagnostic tool in assessing TBIs. Currently, there is a widely varied practice in evaluation of patients with mild TBIs. We hypothesize that patients with an initially positive head CT and stable GCS (15) are less likely to have positive repeat CTs than patients who's GCS has dropped below 15. METHOD(S): A 5 year retrospective analysis was done (Jan 2007- Dec 2011). Data points included ISS, ICU LOS, Hospital LOS, initial GCS, first head CT scan, lowest GCS between scans, and treatment after 2nd CT. Positive CT findings were considered an increase in contusion, bleed, edema, midline shift, or a new bleed. RESULT(S): In 369 patients, those with a stable GCS (15) were less likely to have a positive repeat CT scan than patients who whose GCS dropped (12.9% vs 24.9%, p<.01). They also tended to require less Interventions (0.8% vs 4.0%, p=0.09). Unchanged patients were more likely to have a lower ISS (14 vs 17, p<.01), ICU LOS(2 vs 3 days, p<.01), and Hospital LOS( 4 vs 6, p<.01). CONCLUSION(S): CT scans are a rapid, non-invasive diagnostic tool that can accurately diagnose a patient's intracranial status. Our study shows that most patients who have initially positive CT scans and maintain a stable GCS of 15 can still safely forego the cost and radiation exposure of repeated scans."

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 15 patients plans and 79 DCA generated in iPlan (BrainLAB, AG, Germany) with a mean equivalent MLC field size of 16.6 mm (range 7.5-32.7mm) were tested. Plans were delivered on a Novalis TX, using the 6XSRS energy mode with a D/R of 1000 MU/min and a HDMLC multileaf collimator (2.5 mm leaf size at isocenter). Using a Lucy 3D QA Phantom (Standard Imaging, Inc., USA), dose distributions were recalculated for each plan and the absolute isocenter dose was checked for each treatment field in the phantom, both with a DD (PTW 60003 Diamond Detector PTW, Freiburg, Germany) and with a PSD (Exradin W1 scintillator, Standard Imaging, Inc., USA). The detectors were positioned in the same way in the phantom, each with its specific insert, both with their longitudinal axis parallel the radiation beam when the gantry is at zero angle (see figure). This position was used to acquire the CT images of the phantom, define the isocenter location and the setup measurements. The figure shows also that the DD creates artifacts in the CT scan caused by the metallic connectors of the detector which lead to dose under-dosage estimation for table position 0degree (the artifact represents a region of density higher than the acrylic material of the phantom which at table position zero falls on the beam path with a consequent larger than real radiation absorption and therefore lowers the dose calculated at isocenter). This effect is not present for the PSD. The DD, because of its small detector volume, is being used as our gold standard for fixed dose rates treatments. Furthermore our DD presents a well centered sensitive detector volume, as measured on X-ray images, of about 0.002 cc against 0.0024 cc of the PSD. Result(s): The mean dose ratio (measured/expected) over all arcs for the DD and PSD was 1.020 (SD 0.035) and 1.020 (SD 0.025) respectively. Excluding DCA with table rotations at 0degree (5 arcs) the mean dose ratio was 1.014 (SD 0.022) and 1.021 (SD 0.026) respectively for the DD and PSD. The mean ratio PSD/DD of the dose readings distribution over all arcs and excluding zero table positions was 1.001 (SD 0.026) and 1.006 (SD 0.014) respectively. Conclusion(s): The Exradin W1 Scintillator seems to be suitable for pretreatment QA of typical clinical MLC based stereotactic radio surgery plans, with equivalent MLC field sizes starting from 7.5 mm. Furthermore, the Exradin W1 Scintillator because of its water equivalence does not cause any dose perturbations. (Figure Presented)."

This study was performed to evaluate the utility of morphologic imaging features, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and radiation dosimetric analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in differentiating PsP from ETP. Serial MRI examinations of 163 patients treated for high-grade glioma were reviewed. 46 patients showed a recurrent or progressive enhancing lesion within 12 weeks of radiotherapy. We used an in-house modified scoring system based on 20 different morphologic features (modified VASARI features) to assess the MRI studies. DTI analyses were performed in 24 patients. MRI changes were defined as recurrent volume (Vrec) and registered with pretreatment computed tomography dataset, and the actual dose received by the Vrec during treatment was calculated using dose-volume histograms. Bidimensional product of T2-FLAIR signal abnormality and enhancing component was larger in the ETP group. DTI metrics revealed no significant difference between the two groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the location of Vrec between PsP and ETP groups. Morphologic MRI features and DTI have a limited role in differentiating between PsP and ETP. The larger sizes of the T2-FLAIR signal abnormality and the enhancing component of the lesion favor ETP. There was no correlation between the pattern of MRI changes and radiation dose distribution between PsP and ETP groups."
2403,Excluded,"Comparison of Neutron Organ and Effective Dose Coefficients for PIMAL Stylized Phantoms in Bent Postures in Cranial and Caudal Irradiation Geometries ABSTRACT: Radiation dose estimations in the human body are performed using computational reference phantoms, which are anatomical representations of the human body. In previous studies, dose reconstructions have been performed focusing primarily on phantoms in an upright posture, which limits the accuracy of the dose estimations for postures observed in realistic work settings. In this work, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103 recommendations for monoenergetic neutron plane sources directed downward from above the head (cranial) and upward from below the feet (caudal) for adult female and male reference phantoms were used to calculate organ absorbed and effective dose coefficients. The Phantom with Moving Arms and Legs (PIMAL) and the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code were used to compute organ-absorbed dose and effective dose coefficients for the upright, half-bent (45degree), and full-bent (90degree) phantom postures. The doses calculated for each of the articulated positions were compared to those calculated for the upright posture by computing the ratios of the coefficients (45degree/upright and 90degree/upright). These ratios were used to assess the effectiveness of upright phantoms in providing a comparable estimate when conducting dose estimations and dose reconstructions for articulated positions. This work compiling neutron cranial and caudal posture-specific dose coefficients completes the series of dose coefficients computed for posture-specific ICRP Publication 116 irradiation geometries for monoenergetic photons and neutrons, in addition to cranial and caudal monoenergetic photons. Results reported demonstrated that organ-absorbed dose coefficients for most of the organs in the CRA and CAU irradiation geometries were significantly higher for the bent phantoms than for the upright phantom. Since the upright phantom underestimates the organ-absorbed dose, this demonstrates the impact of posture while performing dose calculations. Organ doses reported in past neutron dose coefficient data were found to omit effects from neutron resonances at energies of 0.435, 1.0, and 3.21 MeV from 16O in tissue. Reported data notes as high as 60% underestimation for neutron organ-absorbed doses, specifically at the neutron resonance energy region omitted by smoothing. Ongoing studies are examining the effect of resonances on reported neutron organ-absorbed dose coefficients in ICRP 116 geometries."

We report the absorbed radiation dosimetry of i.v.-administered <sup>11</sup>C-NMB, a critical step before applying this radioligand to imaging studies in humans. Material(s) and Method(s): Whole-body PET imaging with a CTI/Siemens ECAT 953B scanner was done in a male and a female baboon. After i.v. injection of 444-1221 MBq of <sup>11</sup>C-NMB, sequential images taken from the head to the pelvis were collected for 3 h. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were identified that entirely encompassed small organs (whole brain, striatum, eyes, and myocardium). Large organs (liver, lungs, kidneys, lower large intestine, and urinary bladder) were sampled by drawing representative regions within the organ volume. Time-activity curves for each VOI were extracted from the PET, and organ residence times were calculated by analytical integration of a multi-exponential fit of the time-activity curves. Human radiation doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 and the standard human model. Result(s): Highest retention was observed in the blood and liver, each with total residence times of 1.5 min. The highest absorbed radiation doses were to the heart (10.5 mGy/kBq) and kidney (9.19 mGy/kBq), making these the critical organs for [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB. A heart absorption of 50 mGy would result from an injected dose of 4,762 MBq [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB.

1950,Excluded,"The hematopoietic system in the context of regenerative medicine Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) represent the prototype stem cell within the body. Since their discovery, HSC have been the focus of intensive research, and have proven invaluable clinically to restore hematopoiesis following inadvertent radiation exposure and following radio/chemotherapy to eliminate hematologic tumors. While they were originally discovered in the bone marrow, HSC can also be isolated from umbilical cord blood and can be ""mobilized"" peripheral blood, making them readily available in relatively large quantities. While their ability to repopulate the entire hematopoietic system would already guarantee HSC a valuable place in regenerative medicine, the finding that hematopoietic chimerism can induce immunological tolerance to solid organs and correct autoimmune diseases has dramatically broadened their clinical utility. The demonstration that these cells, through a variety of mechanisms, can also promote repair/regeneration of non-hematopoietic tissues as diverse as liver, heart, and brain has further increased their clinical value.

Feasibility, safety and radiation exposure considerations BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate our centre's experience on computed-tomography-guided (CT-guided), transforaminal, intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adult subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 and severe spinal deformity.METHOD: This is a retrospective, single-centre study investigating the feasibility and safety of CT-guided, transforaminal, lumbar puncture for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen (Spinranza R; Biogen; Cambridge, MA, USA) in a cohort of adult subjects with SMA type 2, severe neuromuscular scoliosis and previous spinal surgery. Between January 2019 and October 2019, five male, adult, SMA type 2 subjects were eligible to be treated in our centre with nusinersen. The mean age of the patients was 31 +/- 9 years (range 19-43 years). The study's outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and radiation exposure.RESULTS: In total, four patients completed the four loading doses, whilst the fifth patient received only one loading dose; two patients also received their first maintenance doses. Overall, 20 consecutive transforaminal, intrathecal treatments were analysed. Technical success was 100% (20/20 intrathecal infusions). No adverse events were documented following the procedures. Mean dose-length product (DLP) value per injection was 665.4 +/- 715.5 mGy*cm. Estimated mean effective dose per injection was 12.7 +/- 12.9 mSv. Subgroup analysis between the chronologically first 10 versus subsequent 10 procedures demonstrated a clear trend towards less radiation exposure in the latter, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (DLP: 984.7 +/- 903.3 vs. 436.7 +/- 321.5 mGy*cm, P = 0.165; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, CT-guided transforaminal access for intrathecal injection of nusinersen was proven feasible and safe. A decrease in radiation dose over time was noted. Protocols to minimize radiation exposure are essential."

According to the treatment modality, patients were allocated to PCI group and non-PCI group. Univariate survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate survival analysis was performed by a Cox proportional hazards model.A total of 52 patients were included for analysis, among which, 19 patients were in PCI group and 33 were in non-PCI group. Multivariate analysis revealed that PCI (HR = .330; P = .041) was an independently favorable prognostic factor for the overall survival. The median overall survival (OS) time was 32.9 months in PCI group, and 20.4 months in non-PCI group. The 2-year OS rates were 78.0% and 38.0% in PCI and non-PCI group respectively (P = .023). The brain metastasis-free survival (BMFS) rate at 2-year in PCI group was significantly higher than those of non-PCI group (89.0% vs 53.0%, respectively, P = .026).

The TM arose in the course of studies on other questions of radiation effects.METHODS: The left neck and skull base of sixty female Wistar rats, 3 to 4 months of age at the beginning of the external irradiation, were subjected to roentgen rays exposure, fractionated to 2 Grays daily, either up to 20, 40 or 60 Gy. The midline of the neck and skull was always inside the radiation field. The animals were sacrificed either 6 months or 12 months after completion of the randomly assigned irradiation protocol. Five non-irradiated rats served as controls.RESULTS: No TM developed in the non-irradiated animals. Out of 60 irradiated rats 9 developed a pituitary TM (15%). In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas. In this series the TM were predominantly incidental findings at necropsies after pretermed follow-up intervals with a variety of hormone-producing cells. On the other hand, four of nine TM were null adenomas. Necropsies of the brain should be carried out routinely in irradiation studies of the skull."

This approach creates a regression tree according to prognostic variables which partitions into homogenous subsets according to survival. Four protocols, RTOG 83-11, 83-21, 84-03 and 84-07 were analyzed. 83-11 and 84-07 were studies utilizing irradiation with 'alterfractionation; 83-21 and 84-03 were studies evaluating thymocin with irradiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation with thoracic irradiation respectively. Nine pretreatment variables and one treatment variable were analyzed. Adjustment for radiotherapy effect was made in the accelerated treatment protocol (84-07). Overall, median survival for the entire group was 9.0 months with 17% alive at 2 years. Univariate analysis suggests that KPS, <=70 vs. 80-100, pleural effusion, weight loss, <=5% vs. 5%, age, 60 + vs. < 60, T stage (T1 and T2 vs. T3 and T4) and N stage (N- vs. N +) were important prognastic factors. Radiation dose, sex, race and histology were not univariate prognastic factors. RPA identified KPS as the most significant covariate (median survival 5.9 mos. <= 70 vs. 9.9 mos. 80-100). Within KPS 80-100 other splits occurred for N stage, age, weight loss and radiation therapy dose. KPS 170 split at pleural effusion only. The best overall RPA tree has four distinct classes with median survival times ranging from 3.3 to 12.6 months. The RPA classes were validated in an independent non-small cell lung cancer dataset.

Caffeine, theophyline and thyopental inhibited more PD with low Km in the irradiated rats in comparison with the control nonirradiated rats. The activating effect of imidazol on PD with low Km was more marked in irradiated rats. These data could be interpreted in the light of the molecular mechanisms, determining the altered action of some drugs after x-ray irradiation."
3105,Included,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors."

The specific binding of several radioligands previously shown to label the dopamine transporter was determined in an irradiated striatal membrane preparation. The apparent target size of the 1-[1-(2-[3H]benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine site was approximately 98 kDa. However, the apparent target size of the ""cocaine binding site,"" as measured with the cocaine analogue 2 beta-[3H]carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane in the same assays, was approximately 140 kDa. Radiation inactivation of the binding of other ligands (GBR-12935 and mazindol) led to target size estimates in the same range (94 kDa and 133 kDa, respectively). All of these target sizes are significantly larger than the estimate of 70 kDa derived from the deduced amino acid sequence for the cloned dopamine reuptake transporter cDNA. Larger target sizes than expected have also been reported for ligand binding to the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and glucose transporter. The estimated sizes for the ligand binding site(s) associated with the dopamine transporter protein are difficult to reconcile with a single transporter protein of 70 kDa. We conclude that the dopamine transporter protein is a homo- or hetero-oligomer when occupied in situ by uptake-blocking drugs like cocaine."

The changes in the concentrations of catecholamines (CA) were determined by the radioenzymatic method in the pineal gland of rats. Results were evaluated in comparison with those of the sham-irradiated (30, 60, 120 min) control groups of rats. From the results it follows that the concentration of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the rat pineal gland significantly decreased 30 and 120 minutes after irradiation (p < 0.01). At min 60 of the postirradiation period it was possible to observe a tendency to recovery of the levels of DA and NE to control values. Epinephrine (EPI) exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) decrease at min 60 and 120 of postirradiation (by 61.8% and 62.8%, respectively)."
559,Included,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated.METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1.RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium.CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation."

Materials/Methods: We queried our institutional IRB-approved SBRT registry for the period 2004-2014 for any early stage SCLC patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients had biopsy proven disease and were deemed medically inoperable after tumor board review. Routine staging consisted of PET/CT and MRI brain scans only. The treatment model consisted of SBRT to the primary followed by adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (CHT) and then prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). SBRT was delivered employing a stereotactic-specific LINAC with vacuum-bag based immobilization, abdominal compression, and infrared based X-ray positioning system+/- CBCT for image-guidance. Result(s): Of 747 definitively treated cancers over 10 years, 16 (2%) were SCLCs meeting study criteria. Patient characteristics revealed: median KPS was 80 (range 50-90), median age was 69 years (range 45-87), 50% of patients were female, median BMI was 28.2 (range 17.4-41.2). Tumor characteristics revealed: median tumor size was 3.25cm (range1.4-7.2), 4 (25%) tumors were ""central"" (per RTOG 0813 criteria), median PET-SUV<inf>max</inf> was 10.3 (range 2.8-21.1). Median time to SBRT from diagnosis was 2.1 months (range 0.6-6.7). SBRT schedules were: 60 Gy/3 fractions in 25%, 50 Gy/5 fractions in 68.75%, and 30 Gy/1 fractions in 6.25% of cases. Mean follow up was 15 months. Fifteen (94%) received at least 2 cycles CHT, 2 (12.5%) received CHT before SBRT. Nine patients (56%) received PCI and of the 7 (44%) that did not, 1 developed brain metastases prior, 1 refused, and 5 died of non-cancer issues before PCI . There was no grade 3 or higher toxicity; rate of grade 2 or less toxicity was 12.5%. Seven patients (43.75%) were alive at analysis and of the 9 deaths, 2 (22%) were cancer, 5 were non-cancer (56%), 2 unknown cause (22%). Local control was 100% with 13 patients (81.25%) without any failure. Crude rates of failure were one (6.25%) distant and regional nodal and two (12.5%) distant. Median survival was 39 months. Three-year actuarial overall and progression-free survivals were 50.5% and 76%, respectively. Conclusion(s): SBRT for stage I medically inoperable SCLC yields excellent local control. The minimal regional nodal failure lends support to PET for mediastinal staging. The primary failure pattern is distant."
714,Excluded,"Long-term depression is not modulated by ATP receptors in the rat CA1 hippocampal region ATP is an important extracellular messenger in the CNS. In the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for learning and memory processes, it acts both as a modulator and as a mediator of synaptic transmission, with implications for synaptic plasticity phenomena. Recent evidence suggests that ATP modulates activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, it remains unclear if ATP also modulates LTP counterpart's phenomenon, long-term depression (LTD), in the rat hippocampus. This study investigated the effect of ATP analogues on homosynaptic LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (1 Hz; 900 pulses) in the CA1 region of young rat hippocampal slices. The metabolically stable ATP analogues beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM), a P2 receptor agonist, and alpha,beta-MeATP (20 microM), a preferential P2X(1,3) receptor agonist, did not modify LTD (LTD values of 14.7+/-0.5% and 14.1+/-3% for aCSF controls and of 15.1+/-4% and 19.0+/-5.2% for beta,gamma-ImATP and alpha,beta-MeATP, respectively). The ATP analogue beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM) did not modify LTD also in the presence of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (50 nM) (21.5+/-4.2% for DPCPX only and of 23.8+/-8.9% for DPCPX plus beta,gamma-ImATP). Finally, the preferential P2X(1,3) receptor antagonist NF023 (10 microM) had also no effect on LTD (18.6+/-5.2% for aCSF and of 18.7+/-5.2% for NF023). The present results suggest that ATP does not modulate activity-dependent homosynaptic LTD in the rat CA1 hippocampal region by activating P2 receptors."

Multivariable analysis was conducted with use of a Cox proportional hazards model and a stepwise selection algorithm that used p < 0.10 as the criteria for entry and p < 0.05 as retention in the model to identify independent predictors of survival. RESULT(S): Chart records of 478patients (54% of whom were men) diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 41 years (range, 18-83 years).42% of patients had biopsy only, 27% had gross total resection, 6% had near. total resection, and 25% had subtotal resection. 22% of patients were initially treated with radiation, 30% with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 7% with concurrent chemotherapy. Median progression free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 5.1 years and 12.8 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, independent of additional therapy, five factors were identified as independent predictors of OS: age at diagnosis (p = 0.002), Karnofsky performance status (KPS, p < 0.0001), histology (astrocytoma vs. other, p = 0.001), hemispheric location (left or bilateral involvement vs. right, p = 0.02) and gender (male vs. female, p = 0.0003).

Measuring local cerebral blood flow and histopathological studies] BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen."

The head of 15 healthy male subjects was unilaterally exposed for 30 min prior to sleep to a pulse-modulated EMF (GSM handset like signal) with a 10 g-averaged peak spatial specific absorption rate of (1) 0.2 W kg(-1), (2) 5 W kg(-1), or (3) sham exposed in a double-blind, crossover design. During exposure, subjects performed two series of three computerized cognitive tasks, each presented in a fixed order [simple reaction time task, two-choice reaction time task (CRT), 1-, 2-, 3-back task]. Immediately after exposure, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded for 8 h. Sleep architecture was not affected by EMF exposure. Analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a dose-dependent increase of power in the spindle frequency range in non-REM sleep. Reaction speed decelerated with increasing field intensity in the 1-back task, while accuracy in the CRT and N-back task were not affected in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study reveals first indications of a dose-response relationship between EMF field intensity and its effects on brain physiology as demonstrated by changes in the sleep EEG and in cognitive performance."
1295,Included,"Simulated Microgravity and Low-Dose/Low-Dose-Rate Radiation Induces Oxidative Damage in the Mouse Brain Microgravity and radiation are stressors unique to the spaceflight environment that can have an impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These stressors could potentially lead to significant health risks to astronauts, both acutely during the course of a mission or chronically, leading to long-term, post-mission decrements in quality of life. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to high concentrations of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids and low levels of antioxidant defenses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative damage in the brain cortex and hippocampus in a ground-based model for spaceflight, which includes prolonged unloading and low-dose radiation. Whole-body low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma radiation using (57)Co plates (0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) was delivered to 6 months old, mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-6/group) to simulate the radiation component. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Brains were isolated 7 days or 9 months after irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for characterization of oxidative stress markers and microvessel changes. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, was significantly elevated in the cortex and hippocampus after LDR + HLU compared to controls (P < 0.05). The combination group also had the highest level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression compared to controls (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the animals that received HLU only or combined LDR + HLU compared to control (P < 0.05). In addition, 9 months after LDR and HLU exposure, microvessel densities were the lowest in the combination group, compared to age-matched controls in the cortex (P < 0.05). Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers that may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress."

3153,Excluded,"Nucleus- and species-specific properties of the slow (<1 Hz) sleep oscillation in thalamocortical neurons The slow (<1 Hz) rhythm is an electroencephalogram hallmark of resting sleep. In thalamocortical neurons this rhythm correlates with a slow (<1 Hz) oscillation comprising recurring UP and DOWN membrane potential states. Recently, we showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor activation brings about an intrinsic slow oscillation in thalamocortical neurons of the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro which is identical to that observed in vivo. The aim of this study was to further assess the properties of this oscillation and compare them with those observed in thalamocortical neurons of three other thalamic nuclei in the cat (ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body; ventral lateral nucleus) and two thalamic nuclei in rats and mice (lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex). Slow oscillations were evident in all of these additional structures and shared several basic properties including, i) the stereotypical, rhythmic alternation between distinct UP and DOWN states with the UP state always commencing with a low-threshold Ca2+ potential, and ii) an inverse relationship between frequency and injected current so that slow oscillations always increase in frequency with hyperpolarization, often culminating in delta (delta) activity at approximately 1-4 Hz. However, beyond these common properties there were important differences in expression between different nuclei. Most notably, 44% of slow oscillations in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus possessed UP states that comprised sustained tonic firing and/or high-threshold bursting. In contrast, slow oscillations in cat ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body and ventral lateral nucleus thalamocortical neurons exhibited such UP states in only 16%, 11% and 10% of cases, respectively, whereas slow oscillations in the lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex of rats and mice did so in <12% of cases. Thus, the slow oscillation is a common feature of thalamocortical neurons that displays clear species- and nuclei-related differences. The potential functional significance of these results is discussed."

The risk factors for the disorders are: being middle aged, being male and exposed to chemical compounds or radiation. Plasma cell dyscrasias are classified into Myeloma, MGUS, Macroglobulinemia and Heavy Chain Disease. We want to show the uselfuness and importance of Freelite Assay for Myeloma diagnosis. Methods and Results: S.G., a 65-year-old man, was hospitalized in San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital to undergo an operation to his inguinal hernia. He had only a feeble pain at the abdomen, increasing with deambulation. Laboratory tests, performed before the surgery, didn't report important alterations. Haematological parameters had little variations compared to average values and reported a slight pancytopenia (RBC=3,7x106/muL, Plt=129x103/muL, WBC =3,8x103/muL) and a slight macrocytic and hyperchromic anemia (Hct=38,6%, MCV=104fL, MCH=36,1 pg). Calcemia was normal (9,1 mg/dL), serum protein electrophoresis showed a little hypogammaglobulinemia and a little thickening-band before gamma globulins. We measured FLC in S.G serum using Freelite Assay and unexpectedly it reported high levels of kappa free-chains (177 mg/dL) and a kappa/lambda ratio of 17,4. This data were then confirmed by other methods. Serum immunosubtraction identified a signal breakdown of thickeningband from kappa anti-serum in pre-gamma position. Then, we measured k and W chains in urine by nephelometry and performed urine electrophoresis. Nephelometry identified a massive excretion of kappa chains (kappa/lambda urinary ratio = 140) , urinary electrophoresis identified a strong band of immunoglobulins in pre-gamma position and an intermediate excretion of albumin. For the diagnosis of Myeloma we waited for the results of NMR, X-ray and bone marrow biopsy. X-ray reported radiolucency areas only in the cranial theca and NMR reported diploic hyperintense nuclei in L1 on the right side and in L2 on the right peduncle. Conclusion(s): Bioptic test of bone marrow, taken from iliac crest, allowed the identification of a conspicuous plasmocytosis (30%) and confirmed Myeloma diagnosis, which was previously and correctly formulated through FLC laboratory data."
522,Excluded,"Low-dose radiation hypersensitivity in human tumor cell lines: effects of cell-cell contact and nutritional deprivation The hyper-radiosensitivity at low doses recently observed in vitro in a number of cell lines is thought to have important implications for improving tumor radiotherapy. However, cell-cell contact and the cellular environment influence cellular radiosensitivity at higher doses, and they may alter hyper-radiosensitivity in vivo. To confirm this supposition, we investigated the effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on low-dose hypersensitivity in vitro. Cell survival in the low-dose range (3 cGy to 2 Gy) was studied in cells of two human glioma (BMG-1 and U-87) and two human oral squamous carcinoma (PECA-4451 and PECA-4197) lines using a conventional macrocolony assay. The effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance were studied in cells of the BMG-1 cell line, which showed prominent hypersensitivity and induced radioresistance. The induction of growth inhibition, cell cycle delay, micronuclei and apoptosis was also studied at the hyper-radiosensitivity-inducing low doses. Hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance was evident in the cells of all four cell lines to varying extents, with maximum sensitivity at 10-30 cGy, followed by an increase in survival up to 50 cGy-1 Gy. Both the glioma cell lines had more prominent hyper-radiosensitivity than the two squamous carcinoma cell lines. Low doses inducing maximum hyper-radiosensitivity did not cause significant growth inhibition, micronucleation or apoptosis in BMG-1 cells, but a transient G(1)/S-phase block was evident. Irradiating and incubating BMG-1 cells at high density for 0 or 4 h before plating, as well as irradiating cells as microcolonies, reduced hyper-radiosensitivity significantly, indicating the role of cell-cell contact-mediated processes. Liquid holding of BMG-1 cells in HBSS + 1% serum during and after irradiation for 4 h significantly reduced hyper-radiosensitivity, suggesting that hyper-radiosensitivity may be due partly to active damage fixation processes at low doses. Therefore, our findings suggest that the damage-induced signaling mechanisms influenced by (or mediated through) cell-cell contact or the cellular environment, as well as the lesion fixation processes, play an important role in hyper-radiosensitivity. Further studies are required to determine the exact nature of the damage that triggers these responses as well as for evaluating the potential of low-dose therapy."

For agents administered by CED, changes on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging directly resulting from catheter placement, infusion, and the therapeutic compound may confound any interpretation of tumor progression. As part of an ongoing multiinstitutional Phase I study, 14 patients with recurrent malignant glioma underwent CED of interleukin (IL) 13-PE38QQR, a recombinant cytotoxin consisting of human IL-13 conjugated with a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. Serial neuroradiographic changes were assessed in this cohort of patients. METHOD(S): Patients were treated in two groups: Group 1 patients received IL13-PE38QQR before and after tumor resection; Group 2 patients received infusion only after tumor resection. Preoperative and postinfusion MR images were obtained prospectively at specified regular intervals. Changes were noted along catheter tracks on postresection MR images obtained in all patients. A simple grading system was developed to describe these changes. When MR imaging changes appeared to be related to IL1 3-PE38QQR, patients were followed up without instituting new antitumor therapy. CONCLUSION(S): As CED of therapeutic agents becomes more common, clinicians and investigators must become aware of associated neuroimaging changes that should be incorporated into toxicity assessment. We have developed a simple grading system to facilitate communication about these changes among investigators. Biological imaging modalities that could possibly distinguish these changes from recurrent tumor should be evaluated. In this study the authors demonstrate the challenges in determining efficacy when surrogate end points such as time to tumor progression as defined by new or progressive contrast enhancement on MR imaging are used with this treatment modality."

Most of them were exposed to the doses of radiation meeting criteria of so-called ""low doses"": 5 - 100 cGy. The impact of these doses on human health is not fully researched; mainly it refers to mental disorders. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and pathological patterns of formation of mental disorders in liquidators exposed to ""low doses"" of radiation because of the Chernobyl accident. A group of 500 liquidators was examined in a continuous research during 1995-1999 and in 2000-2001. Clinical, clinicalpsychological and psychophysiological methods were mainly used; biochemical blood analysis and functional studies also were used. Change in clinical parameters and survey results were observed in the dynamics. Primary morbidity: a separate group of ""cerebrovascular disorders"" was highlighted. In 1989 it accounted for 14 % of primary morbidity, digestive diseases - 9%, and respiratory diseases - 45 %. In 1994, vascular disorders accounted for 43 %, respiratory diseases - 7% , and the digestive diseases - 25; In 1998 cerebral vascular disorders took first place in the primary morbidity, alongside with the increase of combined diverse classes ""neoplasm"", ""endocrine system disorders"" and ""blood diseases"". Disability: In 1990 cerebrovascular disorders occupied 37 % of all cases of disability, in 1993 - 84% of all disability. These disorders consisted of 90% cerebral disorders and had a tendency to deteriorate over time. We have shown that by the year 1998-1999 the psychoorganic syndrome was presented in 65% of liquidators, and in 83% of cases because of the cerebral vascular disorders. The following clinical forms were described: affective (80%), psychopathic (14.8%), and dementic (5.2%). Over time among the liquidators the number of diseases of various organs and systems are increasing. Among these diseases, cerebrovascular disease comes first; organic CNS lesion (radiation encephalopathy) results in clinically detectable psychoorganic syndrome in the major group of examined liquidators. Thus, it can be concluded that even ""low doses"" of radiation are danger for mental health and its effect grows over time."

These were also discussed in open session at the 16th International Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting in Sydney, Australia, in March 2012 and approved subject to certain revisions and the performance of an Internet vote for approval from the whole Society. This ballot was undertaken in September 2012.RESULTS: The recommendations in relation to volumes are that Gross Target Volume (GTV) should replace Target Volume (TV); Prescription Isodose Volume (PIV) should generally be used; the term Treated Target Volume (TTV) should replace TVPIV, GTV in PIV, and so forth; and the Volume of Accepted Tolerance Dose (VATD) should be used in place of irradiated volume. For dose prescription and measurement, the prescription dose should be supplemented by the Absorbed Dose, or DV% (for example, D95%), the maximum and minimum dose should be related to a specific tissue volume (for example, D2% or preferably D1 mm3), and the median dose (D50%) should be recorded routinely. The Integral Dose becomes the Total Absorbed Energy (TAE). In the assessment of planning quality, the use of the Target Coverage Ratio (TTV/ GTV), Paddick Conformity Index (PCI = TTV2/[GTV . PIV]), New Conformity Index (NCI = [GTV . PIV]/TTV2), Selectivity Index (TTV/PIV), Homogeneity Index (HI = [D2% -D98%]/D50%), and Gradient Index (GI = PIV0.5/PIV) are reemphasized. In relation to the dose to Organs at Risk (OARs), the emphasis is on dose volume recording of the VATD or the dose/volume limit (for example, V10) in most cases, with the additional use of a Maximum Dose to a small volume (such as 1 mm3) and/or a Point Dose and Mean Point Dose in certain circumstances, particularly when referring to serial organs. The recommendations were accepted by the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society by a vote of 92% to 8%.CONCLUSIONS: An agreed-upon and uniform terminology and subsequent standardization of certain methods and procedures will advance the clinical science of stereotactic radiosurgery."

Result(s): Between February 2011 and September 2013, a total of 16 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine (liver-predominant disease) received Y-90 TARE in our institution. Eight of these patients received treatment to both liver lobes, for a total of 24 procedures. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0 and 2 prior to treatment. In addition, all patients had a bilirubin level below 2.0 and an albumin level above 3.0 prior to treatment. The median GTV per lobe was 299 cc (range: 27-670 cc). With a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range: 2-26 mo), the 1-year OS was 75%. There was no relationship between OS and GTV volume. Two patients with severe endocrine disorders that required repeated hospitalization (one patient with severe hypoglycemia and a second patient with hypertensive crisis) responded well to TARE, with marked improvement in their medical condition and no need for further admission postprocedure. In terms of treatment toxicity, one patient was diagnosed with a radiation-induced liver disease and died 13 months post-treatment. One patient developed a pancytopenia that was potentially related to treatment. Conclusion(s): The use of Y-90 TARE for patients with liver metastasis from neuroendocrine carcinoma is a treatment option that should be assessed in a prospective multicentric study. In this series, Y-90 TARE was associated with a high 1-year survival rate. However, patients need to be monitored closely postprocedure, since serious treatment-related toxicity could develop."

Thermosetting hydrogels were prepared using different ratios of poloxamer 407 (L127), poloxamer 188 (L68) and Carbopol<sup></sup> 974 P NF (C974) using the cold production process. The in situ thermosetting hydrogel was optimized using Box Behken design. Co-solvency approach was used to increase the solubility of lamotrigine by dissolving it in propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol 400 (0.2: 0.8) and the resultant solution was incorporated in the hydrogel to manufacture an LTG hydrogel. The presence of a higher amount of L127 resulted in higher viscosity at 22 degreeC and 34 degreeC and decreased the overall release of LTG. An increase in the amount of C974 resulted in a decrease in the pH of the hydrogel. The results show that formulations F10, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16 and F17 exhibited acceptable thermosetting behavior, pH and released adequate Lamotrigine above the minimum effective concentration to treat generalized epilepsy. The optimized formulation exhibited acceptable thermosetting behavior, pH and lamotrigine release but formed a stiff gel at 22 degreeC. The average LTG content of the optimized hydrogel was 5.00 +/- 0.0225 mg/ml with % recovery of 99.17%. The amount of LTG released at 12 h from the optimized hydrogel was 3.21 +/- 0.0155 mg and will be therapeutically effective in the brain after absorption via the olfactory region in the nasal cavity.

This method uses synchrotron-generated x-ray microbeams. Rats were implanted with 9L gliosarcomas and the tumors were diagnosed by MRI. They were irradiated 14 days after implantation by arrays of 25 microm wide microbeams in unidirectional mode, with a skin entrance dose of 625 Gy. The effect of using 200 or 100 microm center-to-center spacing between the microbeams was compared. The median survival time (post-implantation) was 40 and 67 days at 200 and 100 microm spacing, respectively. However, 72% of rats irradiated at 100 microm spacing showed abnormal clinical signs and weight patterns, whereas only 12% of rats were affected at 200 microm spacing. In parallel, histological lesions of the normal brain were found in the 100 microm series only. Although the increase in lifespan was equal to 273% and 102% for the 100 and 200 microm series, respectively, the 200 microm spacing protocol provides a better sparing of healthy tissue and may prove useful in combination with other radiation modalities or additional drugs."
235,Included,"New and safe experimental model of radiation-induced neurovascular histological changes for microsurgical research The aim is to create a new and safe experimental model of radiation-induced neurovascular histological changes with reduced morbidity and mortality for use with experimental microsurgical techniques. Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were divided as follows: Group I: control group, 24 rats clinically evaluated during six weeks; Group II: evaluation of acute side-effects (two-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats; and Group III: evaluation of subacute side-effects (six-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats. Variables included clinical assessments, weight, vascular permeability (arterial and venous), mortality and histological studies. No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to the variables studied. Significant differences were observed between groups I vs II-III regarding survival rates and histological changes to arteries, veins and nerves. Rat body weights showed progressive increases in all groups, and the mortality rate of the present model is 10.4% compared with 30-40% in the previous models. In conclusion, the designed model induces selective changes by radiotherapy in the neurovascular bundle without histological changes affecting the surrounding tissues. This model allows therapeutic experimental studies to be conducted, including the viability of microvascular and microneural sutures post radiotherapy in the cervical neurovascular bundle."

A hand-held gamma-detecting probe was used during operation to determine whether gross tumor accumulated the radiolabeled analog and occult tumor could be detected. Positive uptake was defined as tumor/background ratios exceeding 2:1.RESULTS: The tumor in all seven patients with gross disease accumulated 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide. Occult tumor beyond that appreciated with preoperative imaging or by routine operative exploration was detected in a patient with carcinoid tumor. In the patient with the occult gastrinoma the probe detected the lesion within the duodenal bulb before duodenotomy and also predicted what proved histologically to be positive peripancreatic adenopathy. There was a single false-positive reading from the stomach in a patient with suspected carcinoid tumor in whom no tumor could be found grossly or histologically. A pancreatic mass that probed negative proved to be an adenocarcinoma of ductal origin.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-specific peptide-receptor binding can be detected in situ with 125J-TYR(3)-octreotide and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe. This technique may facilitate neuroendocrine tumor localization and operative cytoreduction."
246,Excluded,"Space-clamp problems when voltage clamping neurons expressing voltage-gated conductances The voltage-clamp technique is applicable only to spherical cells. In nonspherical cells, such as neurons, the membrane potential is not clamped distal to the voltage-clamp electrode. This means that the current recorded by the voltage-clamp electrode is the sum of the local current and of axial currents from locations experiencing different membrane potentials. Furthermore, voltage-gated currents recorded from a nonspherical cell are, by definition, severely distorted due to the lack of space clamp. Justifications for voltage clamping in nonspherical cells are, first, that the lack of space clamp is not severe in neurons with short dendrites. Second, passive cable theory may be invoked to justify application of voltage clamp to branching neurons, suggesting that the potential decay is sufficiently shallow to allow spatial clamping of the neuron. Here, using numerical simulations, we show that the distortions of voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents are substantial even in neurons with short dendrites. The simulations also demonstrate that passive cable theory cannot be used to justify voltage clamping of neurons due to significant shunting to the reversal potential of the voltage-gated conductance during channel activation. Some of the predictions made by the simulations were verified using somatic and dendritic voltage-clamp experiments in rat somatosensory cortex. Our results demonstrate that voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents recorded from branching neurons are almost always severely distorted."
2745,Excluded,"Cryptochromes and inner retinal non-visual irradiance detection Nearly all circadian clocks have free-running periods that differ significantly from 24 hours. To maintain synchrony with the 24 h day, the mammalian circadian clock is reset by light. Unlike other animals, mammalian circadian entrainment occurs exclusively via the eyes and optic nerves. Remarkably, the classical photoreceptors--the rods and cones--are not necessary for photic entrainment. Instead, a subset of inner retinal ganglion cells are directly photoresponsive and transmit photic information specifically to brain centres involved in irradiance detection, including the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The photopigment(s) responsible for inner retinal phototransduction are unknown. Several lines of evidence constrain candidate photopigments. First, near-total vitamin A depletion does not diminish retinohypothalamic signalling. Second, loss of cryptochrome function in retinal-degenerate mice substantially decreases photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and markedly decreases pupillary light responses. Third, vitamin A depletion of cryptochrome mutant mice leads to loss of photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These findings suggest a model where either classical photopigments or inner retinal photopigments are sufficient for non-visual irradiance detection."
781,Included,"Ionizing radiation induces structural and functional damage on the molecules of rat brain homogenate membranes: a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study Humans can be exposed to ionizing radiation, due to various reasons, whose structural effects on biological membranes are not well defined. The current study aims to understand the ionizing radiation-induced structural and functional alterations in biomolecules of brain membranes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using rat animal models. For this purpose, 1000 cGy of ionizing radiation was specifically directed to the head of Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were decapitated after 24 h. The results revealed that the lipid-to-protein ratio decreased and that irradiation caused lipid peroxidation and increases in the amounts of olefinic =CH, carbonyl, and methylene groups of lipids. In addition, ionizing radiation induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, disordering of membrane lipids, strengthening of the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate groups of lipid head-groups, and weakening in the hydrogen bonding of the interfacial carbonyl groups of lipids. Radiation further caused significant decrements in the alpha-helix and turns, and significant increments in the beta-sheet and random coil contents in the protein structure. Hierarchical cluster analyses, performed in the whole region (3030-1000 cm(-1)), lipid (3030-2800 cm(-1)), and protein (1700-1600 cm(-1)) regions separately, successfully differentiated the control and irradiated groups of rat brain membranes and showed that proteins in the membranes are affected more than lipids from the damages induced with ionizing radiation. As a result, the current study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy can be used successfully as a novel method to monitor radiation-induced alterations on biological membranes."
1716,Excluded,"Treatment and prognosis of brain metastases from gynecological cancers Brain metastases from gynecological cancers were retrospectively investigated in 18 patients who were treated between 1985 and 2006. Six patients received surgical resection followed by radiotherapy, and 12 patients received only radiotherapy. The median survival for all patients was 4.1 months (range 0.7-48.2 months), and the actuarial survival rates were 11% at both 12 months and 24 months. Univariate analysis showed that treatment modality, extracranial disease status, total radiation dose, number of brain metastases, and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) all had statistically significant impacts on survival. Two patients survived for more than 2 years, and both had single brain metastasis, inactive extracranial disease, 90-100% KPS, and were treated with surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. Improvements in neurological symptoms were observed in 10 of the 12 patients treated with palliative radiotherapy, with median duration of 3.1 months (range 1.5-4.5 months). The prognoses for patients with brain metastases from gynecological cancers were generally poor, although selected patients may survive longer with intensive brain tumor treatment. Palliative radiotherapy was effective in improving the quality of the remaining life for patients with unfavorable prognoses."

CNS relapses have become uncommon with the use of high-dose cytarabine based regimens. The features associated with a higher risk of CNS relapse are not defined. Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8. Therapy was successful in clearing all signs of CNS disease in 29 (41%). 19 of the 29 pts (65%) subsequently had additional CNS relapses after a median of 3 months. The 2-year survival rate after CNS relapse was 13%. There was no difference in overall survival among patients with or without CNS disease. Conclusion(s): CNS relapse is a rare occurrence in AML (5%) and is associated with a poor prognosis. A high prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutations was observed in these pts. FLT3 mutational status and LDH level may identify patients with AML who may benefit from CNS prophylaxis."
1656,Excluded,"Optimal timing and clinical value of radiotherapy in advanced ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with or without baseline brain metastases: implications from pattern of failure analyses BACKGROUND: Despite development of several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib remains one of the first-line treatment options for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and is widely used in situations where next-generation TKIs aren't yet approved or economically inaccessible. However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown.METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions."
2943,Excluded,Low Dose Brain Irradiation Reduces Amyloid-beta and Tau in 3xTg-AD Mice We have previously reported that low doses of external beam ionizing irradiation reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and improved cognition in APP/PS1 mice. In this study we investigated the effects of radiation in an age-matched series of 3xTg-AD mice. Mice were hemibrain-irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy and sacrificed 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Abeta and tau were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantified using image analysis with Definiens Tissue Studio. We observed a significant reduction in Abeta plaque burden and tau staining; these two parameters were significantly correlated. This preliminary data is further support that low doses of radiation may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.
1551,Excluded,"omega-Conotoxin inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission evoked by dorsal root stimulation in rat superficial dorsal horn A number of omega-conotoxins are potent and selective antagonists of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and are potentially effective as analgesic agents. omega-Conotoxins CVID and CVIB, venom peptides from Conus catus, inhibit N-type and N/P/Q-type VGCCs, respectively, in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. In the present study, we tested the effects of five different omega-conotoxins, CVID, CVIB, MVIIA, MVIIC and GVIA, on excitatory synaptic transmission between primary afferents and dorsal horn superficial lamina neurons of rat spinal cord. The N-type VGCC antagonists CVID (200nM) and MVIIA (500nM) completely and irreversibly inhibited excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the dorsal horn superficial lamina. The N- and P/Q-type VGCC antagonist CVIB (200nM) reversibly reduced evoked EPSC amplitude an average of 34+/-8%, whereas MVIIC (200nM) had no effect on excitatory synaptic transmission. In neurons receiving polysynaptic input, CVIB reduced both the EPSC amplitude and the ""success rate"" calculated as the relative number of primary afferent stimulations that resulted in postsynaptic responses. These results indicate that (i) the analgesic action of omega-conotoxins that antagonise N-type VGCCs may be attributed to inhibition of neurotransmission between primary afferents and superficial dorsal horn neurons, (ii) nociceptive synaptic transmission between primary afferents and superficial lamina neurons is mediated predominantly by N-type VGCCs, and (iii) in contrast to the irreversible inhibition by CVID, MVIIA and GVIA, the inhibition of excitatory monosynaptic transmission by CVIB is reversible."

In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant."
843,Excluded,"Afferent-target cell interactions in the cerebellum: negative effect of granule cells on Purkinje cell development in lurcher mice Lurcher (Lc) is a gain-of-function mutation in the delta2 glutamate receptor gene that results in a large, constitutive inward current in the cerebellar Purkinje cells of +/Lc mice. +/Lc Purkinje cells fail to differentiate fully and die during postnatal development. In normal mice, interactions with granule cells promote Purkinje cell dendritic differentiation. Partial destruction of the granule cell population in young +/Lc mice by x irradiation resulted in a significant increase in Purkinje cell dendritic growth and improved cytoplasmic structure but did not prevent Purkinje cell death. These results indicate two components to Purkinje cell abnormalities in +/Lc mice: a retardation/blockade of dendritic development that is mediated by interactions with granule cells and the death of the cell. Thus, the normal trophic effects of granule cell interaction on Purkinje cell development are absent in the +/Lc cerebellum, suggesting that granule cells are powerful regulators of Purkinje cell differentiation."
2301,Excluded,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and sirolimus. Result(s): To date, a total of 41 patients have been transplanted; from 3/14/2008 to 10/3/2013. Patient characteristics: AML n=27, ALL Ph- n=10, ALL Ph+ n=2, Biphenotypic n=2; disease status at HCT, 1RL n=13, 2RL n=2, IF n=26; cytogenetic risk(SWOG criteria): intermediate n=19, unfavorable n=15 and unknown significance n=7 median KPS at HCT 90 (60-100); donor source sibling n=20, HLA matched unrelated n=5, mismatched (1 allele) unrelated n=16; WBC at HCT median 1.5 (0.1-14.9) % blasts (blood) at HCT median 2% (0-85%) % blasts (marrow) at HCT median 46% (10-90%) Two patients presented with extramedullary disease at time of HCT. With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively. The most common toxicity across the dose levels tested is grade 1 GI and grade 2 stomatitis (Bearman Scale). Causes of death were disease progression/persistent disease n=14, GvHD n=1 and infection n=1. Discussion(s): These results are encouraging and suggest that 1) doses of TMLI can be safely escalated to 1800 cGy in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide (MTD not reached, dose escalation will continue to 2000 cGy); 2) all patients treated with >=1700 cGy achieved a CR at the day 30 evaluation and that 3) a reduction in relapse/progression compared to published reports can be achieved without increasing NRM using targeted whole body radiation in this high risk population."
2091,Excluded,"Radiation induced cardiovascular disease: An odyssey of bedside-bench-bedside approach The journey to Mars will be an ambitious, yet arduous task as it will entail culmination of all the information we have gathered over many decades. While the mission is of utmost importance, preservation of astronaut's well-being is paramount also. To that end, mitigation of radiation risk especially afflicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of great interest and challenge. Current data from astronauts on low earth orbit and Apollo missions provides insight on the risk of CVD from radiation exposure. However, data is limited given the small cohort size of astronauts who embarked on just nine prolonged missions. Therefore, a cerebral approach to understanding and mitigating risks are essential. This paper discusses the need for a predictive preclinical model to help understand and mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts. We will discuss strengths and limitations of preclinical models and the methods of validating and constructing a model to predict human clinical outcomes. Our bedside-bench-bedside approach focuses on adapting the preclinical model through common investigative tools used between humans and animals. The result will be an optimization of preclinical model to a point of being a surrogate clinical model capable of predicting CVD outcomes in astronauts exposed to radiation.

Historically, ample evidence has ruled out the substantial short-term impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) emitted by MP on human cognitive performance. However, more recent evidence suggests potential harmful effects associated with MP EMF exposure. The aim of this review is to readdress the question of whether the effect of MP EMF exposure on brain function should be reopened. We strengthen our argument focusing on recent neuroimaging and electroencephalography studies, in order to present a more specific analysis of effects of MP EMF exposure on neurocognitive function. Several studies indicate an increase in cortical excitability and/or efficiency with EMF exposure, which appears to be more prominent in fronto-temporal regions and has been associated with faster reaction time. Cortical excitability might also underpin disruption to sleep. However, several inconsistent findings exist, and conclusions regarding adverse effects of EMF exposure are currently limited. It also should be noted that the crucial scientific question of the effect of longer-term MP EMF exposure on brain function remains unanswered and essentially unaddressed.

Introduction: Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies; however, no serum marker has been routinely recommended until now. Method(s): This is a prospective case control study including two groups of patients: Group Ipatients with advanced lung cancer and Group IIpatients with benign lung disease as control. Serum cytokeratin 19 (CK19) fragment levels were measured at baseline by real-time polymerase chain reaction before first-line chemotherapy. The CK19 cut-off taken was 15-cycle threshold. The primary end point was the comparison of high CK19 in cases and controls. The secondary end point was the correlation between high CK19 and progressive disease (PD), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in advanced lung cancer patients. Result(s): A total of 30 patients with advanced lung cancer (16 non-small and 14 small cell lung cancer) and 15 patients with benign lung disease were included and followed up during the period from October 2008 to October 2011 with median follow-up of one and half years. High CK19 was found in 90% of lung cancer cases as compared with 7% in controls (p < 0.001). High CK19 was found in all cases showing PD (p = 0.04). One-year OS in high CK was 61% as compared with 33% in normal CK (p = 0.1). Conclusion(s): Serum CK19 fragment is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for advanced lung cancer.

2752,Included,"Cerebrovascular events, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality after radiotherapy for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas: a subanalysis from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults CONTEXT: Radiotherapy is frequently administered as adjuvant treatment in patients with clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients. However, a CVE was found significantly more frequently in IRR men but not in women. Further research into the long-term effects of cranial radiotherapy seems mandatory. The potential risks of radiotherapy have to be taken into account when radiotherapy is considered in NFPA patients, and long-term follow-up is recommended."
1707,Excluded,"Iodinated contrast agent time course in human brain metastasis: A study for synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy clinical trials Purpose/Objective(s): Synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy (SSRT) is an innovative treatment combining the selective accumulation of heavy elements in tumors with stereotactic irradiations using monochromatic medium energy x-rays from a synchrotron source. Phase I/II clinical trials on brain metastasis are underway using venous infusion of iodinated contrast agents. The radiation dose enhancement depends on the amount of iodine in the tumor and its time course. Quantitative, post-infusion iodine bio-distribution and associated brain perfusion parameters were studied in human brain metastasis as key parameters for treatment feasibility and quality. The reproducibility of iodine concentrations between the recruitment day and the treatment day was assessed in order to predict dose errors. Materials/Methods: Twelve patients received an intravenous bolus of iodinated contrast agent (40 mL, 4 mL/s), followed by a steady-state infusion (160 mL, 0.5 mL/s) in order to ensure stable intratumoral amounts of iodine during the treatment. Absolute iodine concentrations and quantitative perfusion maps were derived from 40 multi-slice dynamic conventional CT images of the brain (recruitment day) or from quantitative synchrotron radiation CT (treatment day). For three of these patients, iodine concentrations reached in the tumor were compared between the recruitment day and the treatment day (~ 10 days interval). Result(s): The post-infusion mean intratumoral iodine concentration (over thirty minutes) reached 1.94 +/- 0.12 mg/mL. Reasonable correlations were obtained between these concentrations and the permeability surface area product and the cerebral blood volume. Iodine concentrations were reproducible leading to dose errors in the radiotherapy standards. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of contrast agent biodistribution versus time in brain metastasis. The study demonstrates that suitable and stable amounts of iodine can be reached in brain metastasis for SSRT treatment. Moreover, the associated perfusion measurements provide useful information for the patient recruitment and management processes."
2673,Excluded,"Magnetic resonance imaging. Its role in the neuroradiologic evaluation of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has rapidly become a major diagnostic technique, displacing computed tomography (CT) as the primary neuroimaging modality in many disorders of the central nervous system. Neuroimaging studies are valuable in the diagnosis and management of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. This article reviews the technique of MRI and its role in identifying the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of these neurocutaneous syndromes.OBSERVATIONS: MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast without the use of ionizing radiation. It provides more detailed imaging than CT of the characteristic central nervous system lesions of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. In neurofibromatosis type 1, these include optic glioma, astrocytoma, and plexiform neurofibroma, and ""unidentified bright objects"" that are seen only with MRI. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2. Subependymal nodules and cortical and white matter tubers are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis. Manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome include leptomeningeal angiomatosis, hemiatrophy, cortical calcification, and patchy parenchymal gliosis and demyelination.CONCLUSIONS: MRI, especially with gadolinium enhancement, appears to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. MRI may be the imaging method of choice for following certain patients or screening family members. [References: 86]"

2013,Excluded,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K+ conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow after hyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (5 microM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow after hyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca(2+)-spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow after hyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors."
2306,Included,"Resveratrol restores erectile function in irradiated rats: Role on SIRT-1 and nNOS protein expressions INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RVT), a well-known antioxidant agent, on oxidative parameters and erectile function in a rat model of pelvic irradiation. MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

1374,Excluded,"RADIANS: A Multidisciplinary Central Nervous System Clinic Model for Radiation Oncology and Neurosurgery Practice BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for central nervous system disease commonly involves collaboration between Radiation Oncology and Neurosurgery. We describe our early experience with a multidisciplinary clinic model.METHODS: In 2016, the novel RADIANS (RADIation oncology And NeuroSurgery) clinic model was initiated at a community hospital. Disease and treatment demographics were collected and analyzed. Patient satisfaction was assessed via a blinded survey questionnaire.RESULTS: Forty-two patients have been seen since the inception of RADIANS. The median age was 65; and the median patient distance from RADIANS was 42.7 miles (mean = 62.6; range = 0.7-285). Half of the patients traveled >50 miles to receive care, and >80% were seen for central nervous system metastases. Of the patients receiving radiation, 75% received stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy. The mean overall satisfaction from 0 (not satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) was 4.8.CONCLUSIONS: The RADIANS clinic model has proved viable and well-liked by patients in a community setting, with the majority of radiation therapy administered being stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic body radiation therapy rather than conventional fractionation."

213,Included,"Alterations in rat brain neurogenesis following exposure to fractionated doses of ionizing radiation Ionizing radiation commonly used in the radiotherapy of brain tumours can cause adverse side effects to surrounding normal brain tissue. The adult mammalian subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain lateral ventricles (LV) and their subsequent lateral ventricular extension, the rostral migratory stream (RMS), is one of the few areas, which retains the ability to generate new neurons and glial cells throughout life. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurence of radiation-induced alterations of forebrain's neurogenesis. Adult male Wistar rats were investigated 30, 60 or 90 days after whole-body irradiation with fractionated doses of gamma rays (the total dose of 4 Gy). For the study of alterations of the numbers of proliferating cells and precise identification of cell specific phenotype through the migratory pathway, the immunohistochemistry for either doublecortin (DCX), cell marker for immature neurons or glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) for labeling of astrocytes were used. However, the data from quantitative analysis of the numbers of proliferating cells are still under evaluation, our preliminary results showed, that fractionated irradiation has long-lasting effect on extent of neurogenesis in this radiosensitive region. Obtained results should have implications for clinical radiotherapy to avoid complications in therapeutic brain irradiation."
2684,Included,"Chronic pathophysiological changes in normal brain parenchyma raised after radiotherapy can accelerate the recurrence of glioma INTRODUCTION: Tumor recurrence is a leading cause of cancer mortality. Currently, the standard treatment for glioblastoma is maximal surgical resection and concomitant chemoradiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy. However, this treatment offers a limited benefit, with a median progression-free survival of <7 months and a median overall survival of <15 months. Radiation-induced brain injury occurs in a normal brain following radiotherapy; it is described in terms of acute, early delayed and late delayed injury. The recurrence of glioblastoma usually occurs just around the same time as the early or late delayed phase of radiation injury. Our preliminary investigation has revealed that, at three months after X-ray irradiation, tumor-promoting miRNAs (Mir18a, Mir20a, Mir-92, Mir381, etc.) and cytokines (CCL2, CXCL10, SDF-1, Angpt2, etc.) are significantly up-regulated in the irradiated rat normal brain compared to the non-irradiated one. In the present study, therefore, we hypothesized that the pathophysiological changes in a normal brain parenchyma raised by radiotherapy may engage also in the tumor recurrence after the radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To explore above hypothesis, we transplanted rat glioblastoma cells (F98) into a rat brain to which X-ray had been irradiated in advance. Group 1: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to right cerebral hemisphere. Group 2: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to left cerebral hemisphere. Group 3: Sham irradiation was performed (control). 3 months after irradiation, 1x105 of F98 cells were stereotactically transplanted into the right cerebral hemisphere of each rat. RESULT(S): Rats in group 1 and 2 showed significantly shorter survival than rats in group 3 (p-value: 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Interestingly, there was no significant difference of survival between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.8). Histopathological analysis for the tumors revealed that MIB-1 labeling index was significantly higher in group 1 and 2 than in group 3. CONCLUSION(S): It has been reported that, at the tumor recurrence, a lot of mutations including driver ones has been induced and accumulated through chemoradiotherapy, which can promote the tumor regrowth. However, the proliferation capacity of glioblastoma cells significantly increased, even when they were transplanted into the brain previously irradiated. Furthermore, the fact that tumor growth in the non-irradiated cerebral hemisphere of irradiated rats was also accelerated compared to the control group, suggested that some sort of biofactors may spread from irradiated normal brain cells and can make an impact on tumor cells existing in the opposite brain hemisphere. Thus, the delayed radiation injury in normal brain parenchyma might include paradoxical role on the tumor recurrence not only from inside but also from outside the irradiation field."
639,Excluded,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007 What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know. We repeat the call of ecologist Sandra Steingraber: ""From the right to know and the duty to inquire flows the obligation to act."" [References: 147]"
1620,Excluded,"Regulation of motoneuron excitability via motor endplate acetylcholine receptor activation Motoneuron populations possess a range of intrinsic excitability that plays an important role in establishing how motor units are recruited. The fact that this range collapses after axotomy and does not recover completely until after reinnervation occurs suggests that muscle innervation is needed to maintain or regulate adult motoneuron excitability, but the nature and identity of underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the results of experiments in which we studied the effects on rat motoneuron excitability produced by manipulations of neuromuscular transmission and compared these with the effects of peripheral nerve axotomy. Inhibition of acetylcholine release from motor terminals for 5-6 d with botulinum toxin produced relatively minor changes in motoneuron excitability compared with the effect of axotomy. In contrast, the blockade of acetylcholine receptors with alpha-bungarotoxin over the same time interval produced changes in motoneuron excitability that were statistically equivalent to axotomy. Muscle fiber recordings showed that low levels of acetylcholine release persisted at motor terminals after botulinum toxin, but endplate currents were completely blocked for at least several hours after daily intramuscular injections of alpha-bungarotoxin. We conclude that the complete but transient blockade of endplate currents underlies the robust axotomy-like effects of alpha-bungarotoxin on motoneuron excitability, and the low level of acetylcholine release that remains after injections of botulinum toxin inhibits axotomy-like changes in motoneurons. The results suggest the existence of a retrograde signaling mechanism located at the motor endplate that enables expression of adult motoneuron excitability and depends on acetylcholine receptor activation for its normal operation."
2487,Excluded,"Long-term clinical safety of high proton radiation doses delivered with pencil beam scanning paradigm to the spinal cord for extracranial malignancies Purpose/Objective(s): Standardly employed radiotherapy dose limits for the spinal cord tend to be very conservative. Historical data from re-irradiation and combined photon/proton beam series suggest that the tolerance might be much higher. Nevertheless, uncertainties persist due to short follow-up, mixed techniques, and dose summation in these efforts. To add further clarity, we analyzed our institutional experience regarding the incidence of radiation-induced spinal cord toxicity following treatment exclusively with high dose, pencil beam scanning proton therapy (PBSPT). Materials/Methods: Seventy two patients (median age: 51, range 23-79; male/female ratio 1:1), treated for spinal chordoma (n=51) or chondrosarcoma (n=21), met the following criteria and were retrospectively analyzed: maximum dose to the spinal cord of >= 45 Gy (RBE), proton therapy only, >= 18 years of age, and clinical follow-up of >12 months. Patients received 64.0 e 74.4 Gy (RBE) (median: 74.0 Gy (RBE)), generally with 1.8-2.0 Gy (RBE) per fraction, between 2000 and 2014. The Dmax, D2%, V40, V45, V50, V55, and V60 of the spinal cord (SC) and center of spinal cord (CSC; 2-3 mm diameter ROI at geometric center of the cord) were calculated for all patients. Median follow-up was 66 months (range: 13-160 months). Toxicity was scored according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03). Descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed. Result(s): Patients received a mean Dmax / D2% to the spinal cord of 59 Gy (RBE) / 55 Gy (RBE) and to the CSC of 52 Gy (RBE) / 51 Gy (RBE), respectively. Four patients (6%) developed acute radiation-induced neurologic toxicity (Grade 1: nZ1, Grade 2: nZ3). Seventeen percent of patients experienced minor late neurologic toxicities (Grade 1: nZ7, Grade 2: nZ4). Of these patients, 4 developed Lhermitte's syndrome. One patient experienced Grade 4 toxicity (tetraplegia) after receiving 58 Gy (RBE) to the surface and 54 Gy (RBE) to the CSC (SC: V45 11.8 cc, V50 9.35 cc; CSC: V40 3.17 cc, V45 3.1 cc). Of note, the patient was considered high-risk due to postoperative, transient tetraparesis prior to PBSPT and potential spinal instability with a narrow canal. On final analysis, no significant correlation was found between spinal cord Dmax, CSC Dmax, or length of CTV and toxicity. However, higher CSC Dmax and longer CTV tended to correlate with >= Grade 2 neurologic toxicity, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): PBSPTwith spinal cord doses of up to 60Gy(RBE) to the surface and 50Gy (RBE) to the center is associatedwithminimal spinal toxicity. In our experience, doses up to 64 Gy (RBE) to the surface of the spinal cord are deemed acceptable if unavoidable in achieving adequate tumor coverage."
1308,Excluded,"Brain DNA damage and 70-kDa heat shock protein expression in CD1 mice exposed to extremely low frequency magnetic fields PURPOSE: The question of whether exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF), may contribute to cerebral cancer and neurodegeneration is of current interest. In this study we investigated whether exposure to ELF-MF (50 Hz-1 mT) harms cerebral DNA and induces expression of 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70).MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD1 mice were exposed to a MF (50 Hz-1 mT) for 1 or 7 days (15 h/day) and sacrificed either at the end of exposure or after 24 h. Unexposed and sham-exposed mice were used as controls. Mouse brains were dissected into cerebral cortex-striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum to evaluate primary DNA damage and hsp70 gene expression. Food intake, weight gain, and motor activity were also evaluated.RESULTS: An increase in primary DNA damage was detected in all cerebral areas of the exposed mice sacrificed at the end of exposure, as compared to controls. DNA damage, as can be evaluated by the comet assay, appeared to be repaired in mice sacrificed 24 h after a 7-day exposure. Neither a short (15 h) nor long (7 days) MF-exposure induced hsp70 expression, metabolic and behavioural changes.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in vivo ELF-MF induce reversible brain DNA damage while they do not elicit the stress response."
265,Included,"Gene expression, telomere and cognitive deficit analysis as a function of Chornobyl radiation dose and age: from in utero to adulthood UNLABELLED: Objective - to estimate the possible effects of low dose ionizing radiation on human cognitive function in adult hood and in utero.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive tests, telomere length and expression of genes regulating telomere function were studied in Chornobyl cleanup workers who were exposed to doses under 500 mSv (n = 326) and subjects exposed in utero during the first days after the accident Prypiat town (n = 104). The neurocognitive assessment covered mem ory, attention, language, executive and visiospatial functions. In young adults after prenatal exposure a relation ship was analyzed between a cognitive function and radiation dose to foetus, brain and thyroid gland. Internal con trols were used for both groups - the group of Chornobyl cleanup workers exposed in doses less than 20 mSv and an age matched comparison group from radioactively contaminated areas for subjects exposed in utero.RESULTS: Cognitive functions in cleanup workers exposed to ionizing radiation at adulthood are characterized by symptoms of a mild cognitive impairment according to the MMSE (mean group score 25,58 +/- 2,95) and a significant ly higher level of mental disorders according to the BPRS in a dose related manner. Cleanup workers exposed to doses over 500 mSv demonstrate a significant cognitive deficit in comparison with those exposed below 500 mSv and espe cially non exposed patients. Subjects exposed in utero during the check at age of 25-27 years exhibit an excess of the disorders of autonomic nervous system (ICD 10: G90). Neurological microsymptoms as well as neurotic, stress relat ed and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) dominate. Relationship were revealed between the TERT, TERF1, TERF2 genes expression, relative telomere length (RTL),cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular pathology, radiation dose and age. Telomere length in cleanup workers is sreduced after 50 years (6.1 %). The most significant reduction in telomere length is shown after 70 years (11.7 %). Negative correlation was found between telomere length and degree of cog nitive deficit (MMSE scale) and between age and degree of cognitive deficit. The RTL is significantly decreased in groups of persons with cognitive deficit compared to a comparison group. Telomere length at the late period after low dose radiation exposure is downregulated by the high TERF2 gene expression combined with low expression of TERT gene. After exposure to doses over 250-500 mSv a cognitive deficit and dementia were associated with a substantial increase in TERT gene expression, overexpression of TERF1 and decrease in expression of TERF2 gene. A relationship was revealed between the TERF2 gene expression and CD95+ cell fraction susceptible to apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cognitive deficit in humans at a late period after radiation exposure is influ enced by dose, age at exposure and gene regulation of telomere function."

The most frequent findings across all follow-up examinations were macular microaneurysms (75.6% of examinations), macular angiographic leakage (75.1%), and optic disc hyperfluorescence (62.8%). The median number of features present increased significantly with each follow-up to a maximum of 7 features at 8 years. The prevalence of neovascularization of the disc at 5 years was 5.2%. The prevalence of optic neuropathy at 5 years was 27.4%. Prognostic factors for more prevalent and severe posterior pole abnormalities were diabetes, tumor location close to both optic nerve and foveal avascular zone, and greater dose of radiation to the foveola and optic nerve head.CONCLUSIONS: The amount and severity of retinopathy and optic neuropathy after iodine-125 brachytherapy increased through 8 years of follow-up. Assessment of photographs and angiograms taken in accord with a standard protocol provided reliable estimates of rates of development of features of retinopathy and optic neuropathy in eyes treated using the COMS brachytherapy protocol. Our findings support earlier reports that tumor factors in addition to radiation treatment may contribute to posterior pole abnormalities.FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article."
2007,Excluded,Aortic arch injection with C-arm cone beam CT for radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Technical note Background: C-arm cone beam CT (CBCT) with selective intra-arterial contrast injection combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is currently used for the evaluation and treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In some instances an AVM will derive its blood supply from more than one main cervical artery (carotid and/or vertebral artery) and a single-vessel injection will not adequately demonstrate the entire AVM nidus. Method(s): Three patients with cerebral AVM in whom the entire nidus could not be visualized by injection of a single cervical artery are reported. CBCT dataset acquisition was performed by intra-arterial contrast injection in the ascending thoracic aorta through a 5 F pigtail catheter. The injection of diluted iodinated contrast agent (35%) lasted 22 s at a rate of 8 ml/s for a total volume of 176 ml (61.6 ml of contrast agent). The dataset was then processed using standard reconstruction methods. Result(s): Contrast injection in the ascending aorta during a single CBCT acquisition provided a volumetric dataset adequate for subsequent radiosurgical treatment planning. Conclusion(s): This is a safe and effective angiographic technique for the acquisition of volumetric datasets using CBCT that are suitable for treatment planning of intracranial AVMs deriving their blood supply from more than one major cervical artery. This technique allows imaging of the entire AVM nidus during a single CBCT acquisition.
2557,Included,"The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage induced by interstitial irradiation in normal monkey brain OBJECTIVE: The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage is unclear. We examined the effect of early treatment of high-dose dexamethasone on iridium-192-induced damage to normal brain tissue.METHODS: Brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation with iridium-192 was evaluated with sequential magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 11 adult monkeys, with or without short-term high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight/d) was administered intramuscularly to five irradiated animals every 24 hours, beginning 2 days before and ending 7 days after irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after irradiation.RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 week after irradiation revealed marked edema in five nontreated animals. In dexamethasone-treated animals, the volume of edema was reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 1 week and 1 month after irradiation. The volume of ring enhancement in dexamethasone-treated animals was also reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 3 months after the irradiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra revealed that N-acetylaspartate and choline peaks were reduced 1 week after irradiation in both groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time points.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dexamethasone treatment may have an antiedema effect at an early stage and may modify subsequent development of vascular and inflammatory changes but may have no effect of preventing radiation-induced necrosis and the reduction of N-acetylaspartate after brachytherapy."
2451,Excluded,"""Soundmorphing"": a new approach to studying speech perception in humans A problem in current studies of brain activation in speech perception is that most studies use stimuli that are sampled from different categories. This study presents a new approach in creating acoustic stimuli by filtering real words in different ways, thus this enables one to 'morph' the sounds gradually from something like tones to real words while preserving temporal characteristics (""soundmorphing""). This will make it possible to explore steps between tone and speech processing on a gradual scale. This study aimed to investigate more closely the network, involved in the perception of speech and the decoding of auditory (speech-)stimuli. Sets of auditory stimuli were created by dividing real words into several frequency-bands and creating a randomised rearrangement of these components. Four different sets of stimuli were used, containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 frequency bands (total range: 0-2500 Hz). Only the latter one contained intelligible words. During the fMRI session, these four trial types were presented pseudo-randomised. In all conditions, significant activations of auditory cortex were observed. The number of activated voxels and their significance increased over the four trial types. In addition, Broca's area, SMA, left thalamus, and right cerebellum were activated in the most complex and most speech-like condition. Comparing these complexes with the tone-like trials, only the left auditory cortex, left SMA, and cingulate gyrus became significant. These activations reflect the bilateral processing of the auditory stimuli, but only the left temporal areas demonstrated an increasing BOLD response with an increasing number of presented frequency components."
417,Excluded,"Analysis of pseudoprogression after proton or photon therapy of 99 patients with low grade and anaplastic glioma Background and purpose: Proton therapy is increasingly used to treat primary brain tumors. There is concern for higher rates of pseudoprogression (PsP) after protons compared to photons. The purposes of this study are to compare the rate of PsP after proton vs. photon therapy for grade II and III gliomas and to identify factors associated with the development of PsP. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety-nine patients age >18 years with grade II or III glioma treated with photons or protons were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, IDH and 1p19q status, and treatment factors were analyzed for association with PsP, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were treated with photons and 34 with protons. Among those with oligodendroglioma, PsP developed in 6/42 photon-treated patients (14.3%) and 4/25 proton-treated patients (16%, p = 1.00). Among those with astrocytoma, PsP developed in 3/23 photon-treated patients (13%) and 1/9 proton-treated patients (11.1%, p = 1.00). There was no difference in PsP rate based on radiation type, radiation dose, tumor grade, 1p19q codeletion, or IDH status. PsP occurred earlier in oligodendroglioma patients treated with protons compared to photons, 48 days vs. 131 days, p <.01. On multivariate analyses, gross total resection (p =.03, HR = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.25-0.93) and PsP (p =.04, HR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.05-0.91) were associated with better PFS; IDH mutation was associated with better OS (p <.01, HR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.08-0.65). Conclusion(s): Patients with oligodendroglioma but not astrocytoma develop PsP earlier after protons compared to photons. PsP was associated with better PFS. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors"
1497,Excluded,"Maternal exposure to delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) alters indolamine levels and turnover in adult male and female rat brain regions Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC has been shown to produce effects on brain development. In this study we evaluated the changes induced by maternal exposure to delta 9-THC (5 mg/kg per day) from gestational day 5 to postnatal day 24 in eight discrete brain areas on the central serotoninergic system in both adult male and female rats. These result show that maternal exposure to delta 9-THC from gestational day 5 to postnatal day 24 affects development of the various central indoleaminergic system of the offsprings brain. Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC decreased the levels of 5-HT in hypothalamus and rostral neostriatum in exposed males, and also decreased the levels of 5-HT in ventral hippocampus, septum, and midbrain raphe nuclei in both exposed males and females. Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC increased the levels of 5-HIAA in dorsal hippocampus, hypothalamus, septum, midbrain raphe nuclei, and rostral neostriatum in exposed males and females. We have also found differences between nonexposed males and females in several brain regions. Our results confirm a regional and sexual specificity in endogenous levels of indoleamine after perinatal delta 9-THC treatment, being the midbrain raphe nuclei the most affected area."
2976,Excluded,"Adaptive replanning strategies accounting for shrinkage in head and neck IMRT PURPOSE: Significant anatomic and volumetric changes occur in head and neck cancer patients during fractionated radiotherapy, and the actual dose can be considerably different from the original plan. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the differences between planned and delivered dose, (2) to investigate margins required for anatomic changes, and (3) to find optimal replanning strategies.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eleven patients, each with one planning and six weekly helical CTs, were included. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated using the simultaneous integrated boost technique. Weekly CTs were rigidly registered to planning CT before deformable registration was performed. The following replanning strategies were investigated with different margins (0, 3, 5 mm): midcourse (one replan), every other week (two replans), and every week (six replans). Doses were accumulated on the planning CT for comparison of various dose indices for target and critical structures.RESULTS: The cumulative doses to targets were preserved even at the 0-mm margin. Doses to cord, brainstem, and mandible were unchanged. Significant increases in parotid doses were observed. Margin reduction from 5 to 0 mm led to a 22% improvement in parotid mean dose. Parotid sparing could be preserved with replanning. More frequent replanning led to better preservation; replanning more than once a week is unnecessary.CONCLUSION: Shrinkage does not result in significant dosimetric difference in targets and critical structures, except for the parotid gland, for which the mean dose increases by approximately 10%. The benefit of replanning is improved sparing of the parotid. The combination of replanning and reduced margins can provide up to a 30% difference in parotid dose."
1491,Excluded,"Cardiovascular deconditioning in rats results in anhedonia, sympathovagal imbalance and increased predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias Hindlimb unloading (HU) is an animal model that simulates the physiological adaptations to spaceflight or bed-rest in humans. We hypothesized that HU would elicit anhedonia, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and increased arrhythmogenesis. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats confined to 10-14 days of HU, or casted control (CC) condition were surgically instrumented with indwelling vascular catheters, a radiotelemetry transmitter or an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrode. Anhedonia was measured through sucrose preference and the response to ICSS. Sequential autonomic blockade following administration of propranolol and atropine and time-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were used to measure sympathovagal balance. Cardiac arrhythmias were produced and scored following sympathetic stimulation (SS) via isoproterenol administration and brief handling/restraint. HU resulted in reductions in both sucrose preference and ICSS. Propranolol administration elicited a significantly greater bradycardia in HU vs. CC rats, while the tachycardic response to methyl-atropine was nearly abolished in HU rats. HU resulted in a significantly lower HRV and a greater arrhythmic burden following SS. Thus, HU elicits behavioral signs consistent with psychological depression, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and an increased vulnerability to cardiac arrhythmias."

1917,Excluded,"Weak MGMT gene promoter methylation confers a clinically significant survival benefit in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma: a retrospective cohort study INTRODUCTION: Quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) is a frequently used technique to assess MGMT gene promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients. The optimal technical cut-off value to distinguish methylated from unmethylated samples is nevertheless still undetermined. In literature, a ""grey zone"" of diagnostic uncertainty has been described.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated according to the Stupp protocol. Epidemiological data were gathered from the individual patient files. MGMT gene promoter methylation status was determined on stored tumour samples using qMSP. A strong, weak or absent promoter methylation was determined based on Cq values (quantification value) of the MGMT and ACTB primers as well as a positive control sample.RESULTS: In total, 181 patient files were reviewed and included for statistical analysis. MGMT promoter hypermethylation was detected in 38.7% of glioblastoma patients. The median overall survival of unmethylated and strongly methylated patients was 10.1 months and 19.7 months respectively. Furthermore, 11% of the total patient cohort had a weak MGMT gene promoter methylation. The median OS in this subgroup was 15.4 months, significantly better compared to the unmethylated cohort (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed weak MGMT promoter methylation as an independent prognostic parameter for overall survival.CONCLUSION: Glioblastoma patients with weak promoter methylation show a statistically significant longer overall survival when compared to clearly unmethylated patients. Patients with grey zone qMSP test results should receive additional molecular analysis in future to further direct individual therapy strategies."
2769,Excluded,"Impact of Early Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation With Hippocampal Avoidance on Neurocognitive Function in Patients With Limited Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer. A Multicenter Phase 2 Trial (SAKK 15/12) PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate neurocognitive function (NCF) and clinical outcomes after early hippocampal avoidance (HA) prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited disease (LD) small cell lung cancer (SCLC).METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a phase 2 trial, patients with LD SCLC received HA-PCI concomitant with the second cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy. All patients underwent objective NCF testing at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months after HA-PCI. NCF tests included Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised, Controlled Oral Word Association, and Trail Making Tests A and B. The primary endpoint was NCF decline at 6 months after HA-PCI. We assumed <=30% of patients with no NCF decline to be unpromising. Secondary endpoints included brain metastases-free survival (BMFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of the concomitant treatment.RESULTS: Among the 44 patients enrolled in the trial, 38 had evaluable NCF assessment at 6 months after HA-PCI. The proportion of evaluable patients showing no NCF decline at 6 and 12 months was 34.2% (90% confidence interval [CI], 21.6-48.8) and 48.5% (95% CI, 30.8-66.5), respectively. Median follow-up was 13.2 months (95% CI, 12.6-14.1). At 12 months, BMFS was 84.2% and OS was 87.7% (95% CI, 73.0-94.7). Four patients died of SCLC, 1 of respiratory failure, 1 of hemorrhage, and 1 for unknown reason. The most frequently reported grade >=3 acute adverse events were anemia (21.4%), febrile neutropenia (19.1%), and fatigue (14.3%).CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients showing no NCF decline 6 and 12 months after early HA-PCI does not appear to be better than, but rather similar to, that observed in patients receiving sequential PCI without HA. Early HA-PCI in LD SCLC is feasible, with observation of promising BMFS and OS in this selected population."
224,Included,Ultrasonic investigations of the soleus muscle after space flight on the Biosputnik 936 The study was aimed at quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the muscle fibres and the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle of animals after a space flight on Biosputnik 936. Ultrastructural morphometric studies of the muscle fibres demonstrated diminished volume of sarcomer and accumulation of glycogen granules. The mean number of mitochondrial profiles decreased. The investigations of the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle showed diminution of the mean number of synaptic vesicles and swelling of the mitochondria. This changing in the fibres and axonal endings we can interpret as the first step of degeneration.
885,Excluded,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients. No radiation colitis or neuropathy occurred. Moderate-dose IORT and EBRT is safe, taking into account related late toxicities. It is an effective local treatment approach, resulting in an encouraging local control rate."

2563,Included,"Extracranial carotid stenosis after radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a Malaysian study Background and objectives: Radiation treatment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known to be associated with increased prevalence of carotid stenosis. The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD. Conclusion(s): Extracranial internal carotid artery is the most common site of stenosis following radiotherapy in NPC. This suggests that local trauma from irradiation is the most important factor in predisposition to atherosclerosis following radiation therapy."
2064,Excluded,"A multi-center analysis of single-fraction versus hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastasis BACKGROUND: Hypofractionated-SRS (HF-SRS) may allow for improved local control and a reduced risk of radiation necrosis compared to single-fraction-SRS (SF-SRS). However, data comparing these two treatment approaches are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes between SF-SRS versus HF-SRS across our multi-center academic network.METHODS: Patients treated with SF-SRS or HF-SRS for brain metastasis from 2013 to 2018 across 5 radiation oncology centers were retrospectively reviewed. SF-SRS dosing was standardized, whereas HF-SRS dosing regimens were variable. The co-primary endpoints of local control and radiation necrosis were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to evaluate the impact of select independent variables on the outcomes of interest. Propensity score adjustments were used to reduce the effects confounding variables. To assess dose response for HF-SRS, Biologic Effective Dose (BED) assuming an alpha/beta of 10 (BED<sub>10</sub>) was used as a surrogate for total dose.RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty six patients with 335 brain metastasis treated with SF-SRS (n = 222 lesions) or HF-SRS (n = 113 lesions) were included. Prior whole brain radiation was given in 33% (n = 74) and 34% (n = 38) of lesions treated with SF-SRS and HF-SRS, respectively (p = 0.30). After a median follow up time of 12 months in each cohort, the adjusted 1-year rate of local control and incidence of radiation necrosis was 91% (95% CI 86-96%) and 85% (95% CI 75-95%) (p = 0.26) and 10% (95% CI 5-15%) and 7% (95% CI 0.1-14%) (p = 0.73) for SF-SRS and HF-SRS, respectively. For lesions > 2 cm, the adjusted 1 year local control was 97% (95% CI 84-100%) for SF-SRS and 64% (95% CI 43-85%) for HF-SRS (p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis, SRS fractionation was not associated with local control and only size <=2 cm was associated with a decreased risk of developing radiation necrosis (HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.07-0.58, p < 0.01). For HF-SRS, 1 year local control was 100% for lesions treated with a BED<sub>10</sub> >= 50 compared to 77% (95% CI 65-88%) for lesions that received a BED<sub>10</sub> < 50 (p = 0.09).CONCLUSIONS: In this comparison study of dose fractionation for the treatment of brain metastases, there was no difference in local control or radiation necrosis between HF-SRS and SF-SRS. For HF-SRS, a BED<sub>10</sub> >= 50 may improve local control."
1635,Excluded,"Biopsy of enlarging lesions after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases frequently reveals radiation necrosis Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers excellent local control for brain metastases (BM) with low rates of toxicity. Radiation necrosis (RN) may occur after treatment and is challenging to distinguish from local recurrence (LR). We evaluated enlarging brain lesions following SRS that were subsequently biopsied to differentiate RN versus LR.Methods: This study reviewed patients receiving SRS for BM between 2008 and 2012 who underwent a biopsy for suspicion of RN versus LR on MRI. Data collection included demographics, radiation parameters, imaging findings, and post-biopsy pathology. Kaplan-Meier methods determined overall survival. Fisher's exact test assessed for association between lesion biopsy result and variables of interest.Results: Thirty-four patients with 35 biopsied BM were included. Lesions were biopsied a median of 8.8 months after SRS. Most patients had primary lung cancer (11; 31.4%). Eleven (31.4%) biopsies were positive for LR and 24 (68.6%) showed RN only. Median overall survival was longer for patients with RN (31.0 mo) than for patients with LR (14.5 mo; P = 0.135). Time from SRS to biopsy was significantly different between RN and LR groups; 10 lesions (52.5%) biopsied <=9 months after SRS showed LR, whereas 1 lesion (6.3%) biopsied >9 months after SRS showed LR (P = 0.004). For 16 (65.7%) lesions, management was changed or directed by the biopsy results.Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy for accessible enlarging lesions after SRS appears diagnostically valuable in patients with few lesions and changes clinical management. RN should be suspected in patients with an enlarging lesion more than 9 months post-SRS."
1893,Included,"[Effect of the psychostimulants caffeine and methylphenidate on the efficiency of physical activity in rats exposed to ionizing radiation] The authors carried out studies on 267 male rats and examined the effect of ionizing irradation (single irradation with 737 roentgens) on the duration of swimming and on the alteration of this effect by psychic stimulators caffeine and methylphenidate, administered in overthreshold doses (30 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for caffeine and 5 and 10 mg/kg of body weight for methylphenidate). On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced. The cyclic AMP is presumed to have some protective effect against ionizing irradiation."

Five experimental groups of male S.D. rats were injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) subcutaneously, 20 mg/kg b.wt., once a week for four weeks, with exposure to 1 mT DC-MF (12 hours/day) as follows: Before (pre) the carcinogen administration (group 1), simultaneously (group 2), after (post) the carcinogen administration (group 3) and daily from the beginning to the end of the experiment after 12 weeks (group 4). Rats of group 5 served as carcinogen-only treated controls while those of group 6 were non-treated controls. There were no differences in the incidences and multiplicities of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF), putative preneoplastic lesions, among all groups except that large foci in group 1 were significantly fewer in numbers than those found in group 5. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling indexes (PCNA-LI) in the colon epithelium were essentially the same in MF-treated and control rats. Histopathological examination showed evident hemorrhage in the pituitary glands of some rats of groups 1-3, and in most rats of group 4. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed ultrastructural changes, but DNA ploidy analysis revealed no carcinogenicity to MF-exposed pituitary glands. Serum levels of AST, ALT, total protein, creatinine, albumin, albumin/globulin ratio and growth hormone levels did not change among the groups. The present study revealed that the action of an artificial MF on rats is not carcinogenic/or cancer-promoting, at least in the present protocol for colon carcinogenesis."

Three microcirculatory parameters: blood-brain barrier permeability, leukocyte behavior and plasma velocity were measured before and after RF-EMF exposure using a closed cranial window method.RESULTS: No extravasation of intravenously injected dyes from pial venules was found at any BASAR level. No significant changes in the number of endothelial-adhering leukocytes after exposure were found. The plasma velocity remained constant within the physiological range through each exposure.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that there were no effects on the cerebral microcirculation under the given RF-EMF exposure conditions."
552,Excluded,"Locus coeruleus activation by foot shock or electrical stimulation inhibits amygdala neurons The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) has a direct projection to the basal lateral amygdala (BLA). Behavioral, lesion and pharmacological studies suggest that this pathway has an important role in mediating responses to emotional stimuli and in the formation of long term memory. The effect of LC activation on the activity of BLA neurons in vivo is not known. Therefore, in the present experiments, simultaneous extracellular unit recordings were made in the two regions while the anesthetized rat received electrical stimulation of the paw to simulate a real-life acute stressor, commonly used as an aversive reinforcer in conditioning experiments. All LC neurons exhibited a multiphasic excitatory response followed by prolonged inhibition. Responses of BLA cells were more heterogeneous, but predominantly inhibitory, with a release from inhibition during the refractory phase of LC. Direct electrical stimulation of the LC with a single pulse also elicited an inhibitory response in BLA. BLA response to both footshock and LC stimulation was partially blocked by the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, timolol, infused into the BLA. These experiments are the first to report in vivo effects of activation of the noradrenergic system on neuronal activity in the BLA."

To evaluate cognitive status in subjects exposed to ionizing radiation during antenatal development. Materials and methods. A total of 77 subjects with antenatal exposure to radiation were studied, along with a reference group of 73 subjects living in radiologically unpolluted territories in the Chelyabinsk region. Clinical, clinical psychological (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS), and proverb interpretation) neurophysiological (EEG), and laboratory (cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins triglycerides, cortisol, melatonin) methods were used. Results and discussion. These investigations showed that a significantly greater proportion of subjects exposed to radiation during antenatal development had nonpsychotic mental disorders with a predominance of organic mental impairments (cognitive and asthenic). Neurophysiological studies identified more profound abnormalities in brain bioelectrical activity with pathological rhythms and a predominance of the theta rhythm among those exposed to radiation. Clinical psychological study data identified a significant decrease in analytical-synthetic ability in irradiated subjects, along with lower general and verbal IQ levels. These changes were accompanied by higher cortisol and melatonin levels, supporting activation of and tension in the mechanisms of adaptation in subjects irradiated during antenatal development.

Numerous studies have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate motor system plasticity. However, research on the reliability of TMS measures of motor cortex organization and excitability is limited. We sought to test the reliability of these TMS measurements.METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were tested twice over a two-week period using TMS to determine motor threshold, map topography, and stimulus-response curves for first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles.RESULTS: We found moderate to good test-retest reliability TMS measurements of motor threshold (ICC=0.90-0.97), map area (ICC=0.63-0.86) and location (ICC=0.69-0.86), and stimulus-response curves (ICC=0.60-0.83).CONCLUSIONS: TMS assessments of motor representation size, location, and excitability are generally reliable measures, although their reliability may vary according to the muscle under investigation.SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that TMS measurements of motor cortex function are reliable enough to be potentially useful in investigation of motor system plasticity."

Proton beams suitable for this are under development. The clinical effects of high single doses on malignant gliomas grade III-IV are presently tested with conventional gamma radiation. Targeting of spread glioma cells with toxic radionuclides tagged to epidermal growth factor, EGF, or to EGF-dextran is presently tested in experimental systems and can, in the near future, be tested in combination with local high doses of external proton radiation. The possibilities to combine proton beams with EGF-guided neutron capture therapy will be considered in a longer perspective."
2382,Included,"Radiation-induced changes in the profile of spinal cord serotonin, prostaglandin synthesis, and vascular permeability PURPOSE: To investigate the profile of biochemical and physiological changes induced in the rat spinal cord by radiation, over a period of 8 months.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The thoraco-lumbar spinal cords of Fisher rats were irradiated to a dose of 15 Gy. The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system."
1689,Excluded,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal.

The specific activity of the product was 640 +/- 390 GBq/mumol (decay-corrected to end of synthesis). The radiochemical purity exceeded 99% in all syntheses. The highest levels of tracer binding were observed in the striatum and olfactory tubercle of rats and control and alpha<inf>2A</inf> KO mice - that is, in the brain regions known to contain the highest densities of alpha<inf>2C</inf> adrenoceptors. In rats pretreated with atipamezole and in alpha<inf>2AC</inf> KO mice, <sup>11</sup>C tracer binding in the striatum and olfactory tubercle was low, similar to that of the frontal cortex and thalamus, regions with low densities of alpha<inf>2C</inf> adrenoceptors.

1695,Included,"Metabolic correction of cerebral radiation syndrome DNA strand breaks that occur after irradiation activate the repair enzyme adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase, which consumes NAD as a substrate and causes depletion first of neuronal NAD and then of the ATP pool. This is considered to be the crucial link in the mechanism underlying the cerebral radiation syndrome (CRS). In this study, two ways to correct the CRS metabolically were examined: (a) prevention of depletion of NAD after irradiation by administration of the enzyme inhibitor nicotinamide and (b) shunting the NAD-dependent oxidative phosphorylation pathway of ATP resynthesis by administration of a substrate of NAD-independent oxidation, succinate. Cerebral lesions induced by radiation were modeled by irradiation of rats or rat brain homogenates with 150 Gy of X rays. The manifestations of CRS in rats (excitement, convulsions, etc.) closely resembled those seen after acute hypoxia. In brain homogenates, pyruvate tetrazolium-reductase activity decreased after irradiation and could be corrected by addition of NAD after irradiation. Succinate tetrazolium-reductase activity was not affected by irradiation. Oxygen consumption by brain homogenates after irradiation in vitro and in situ decreased, as did oxygen consumption by rats in vivo after cranio-caudal irradiation. Administration of nicotinamide or succinate prevented both the postirradiation decrease in respiration (in both rats in vivo and brain homogenates in vitro) and the development of cerebral radiation syndrome. These results help to clarify the mechanisms underlying CRS and its metabolic correction."
1668,Excluded,"Malignant blue nevus with metastases to lymph nodes and brain. [German] We report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus. At the age of 19 years the congenital, pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus. Thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size, involving the entire left buttock within several months. Multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive, pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle. Both benign and malignant cells were S100<sup>+</sup>, vimentin<sup>+</sup> and HMB-45<sup>+</sup>, but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. General examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis. Despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks. This case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may behave aggressively just as a malignant melanoma."
1593,Excluded,"The white 'matter' in obsessive compulsive disorder: Effect of pharmacological treatment and symptom dimensions models Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is highly heterogeneous in its manifestations, both across patients and within the same patient over time. The disorder is probably best described by a multidimensional model involving several symptom dimensions, whose precise number and phenotypes are debated. This heterogeneity partly explains, beyond methodological discrepancies, the inconsistency of results in current brain imaging research in the disorder, particularly in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Purpose(s): We aimed at investigating white matter (WM) alterations associated with OCD, controlling for the impact of variables known to affect WM structure, and specifically for the effect of current and lifetime pharmacological treatment. Then, we tested two different symptom dimensions models [1,2] within OCD patients, analysing theirWMcorrelates, for both prevailing current symptom dimension and symptom dimension at onset. Method(s): We compared 58 adult pure-OCD patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC), with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics on diffusion tensor images, using TFCE correction (p = 0.05). With respect to symptom dimensions, separate analyses were carried on the sole OCD sample. The diffusion measures Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were used as parameters of WM organisation. Result(s): The observed differences between OCD patients and HC were totally carried by the effect of previous and current medications. No differences were in fact observed between drugna ive patients and HC. Current medication was associated with a widespread decrease of FA and increase of RD throughout the whole brain. Lifetime treatment was associated with a decrease in FA in the tracts surrounding the thalami, site of major neurotransmitter alteration in OCD. In the analysis of symptom dimensions, only a finer-grained five-factors model [2] allowed for the identification of specific neural correlates. Patients having current Symmetry/Perfectionism dimension show a reduction in RD and MD in the body of corpus callosum and in left higher-order visual association tracts, including: left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and/or inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, patients having Doubt/Checking dimension at onset show a widespread reduction of AD, encompassing corpus callosum, and bilaterally the thalamic radiations, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Finally, patients having Rituals/Superstition dimension at onset show an increase in FA in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits: genu of corpus callosum, bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations and left external capsule. Conclusion(s): Present results confirm the effect of medications on WM in OCD [3], showing a large effect of current treatment on myelination and a site-specific, disorder-specific, effect of medications on brain systems. Furthermore, our findings provide support to a multidimensional model of OCD, and indicate that the distinction of clinically homogeneous dimensions is essential for the identification of reliable neural correlates. Finally, we evidence, to our knowledge for the first time, that onset symptom dimensions are associated with enduring alterations of WM structure. Onset symptom dimensions may reflect underlying endophenotypes, and our results suggest their relevance for future investigations on OCD neuroanatomy and aetiopathology."
413,Included,"Spatial Memory Performance of Socially Mature Wistar Rats is Impaired after Exposure to Low (5 cGy) Doses of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti Particles Prolonged deep space missions to planets and asteroids will expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), a mixture of low-LET ionizing radiations, high-energy protons and high-Z and energy (HZE) particles. Ground-based experiments are used to determine whether this radiation environment will have an effect on the long-term health of astronauts and their ability to complete various tasks during their mission. Emerging data suggest that mission-relevant HZE doses impair several hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive processes in rodents, but that there is substantial interindividual variation in the severity of neurocognitive impairment, ranging from no observable effects to severe impairment. While the majority of studies have established the effect that the most abundant HZE species (<sup>56</sup>Fe) has on neurocognition, some studies suggest that the lighter <sup>48</sup>Ti HZE particles may be equally, if not more, potent at impairing neurocognition. In this study, we assessed the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti had on the spatial memory performance of socially mature male Wistar rats. Acute exposures to mission-relevant doses (<=5 cGy) of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the mean spatial memory performance of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly (P < 0.015) increased the percentage of rats that have severe (Z score >= 2) impairment, i.e., poor performers. Collectively, these data further support the notion that the LET dependency of neurocognitive impairment may differ from that of cell killing."
735,Excluded,"Use of human mesenchymal stem cell treatment to prevent anhedonia in a rat model of traumatic brain injury PURPOSE: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy."
2839,Included,"Total body 100-mGy X-irradiation does not induce Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis or memory impairment in mice The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. Possible cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from various sources. Early transcriptional response in murine brain to low-dose X-rays (100 mGy) has been reported, suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. To investigate acute and late transcriptional, pathological and cognitive consequences of low-dose radiation, we applied an acute dose of 100-mGy total body irradiation (TBI) with X-rays to C57BL/6J Jms mice. We collected hippocampi and analyzed expression of 84 AD-related genes. Mouse learning ability and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test. We performed in vivo PET scans with (11)C-PIB, a radiolabeled ligand for amyloid imaging, to detect fibrillary amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation, and examined characteristic AD pathologies with immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein (APP), Abeta, tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). mRNA studies showed significant downregulation of only two of 84 AD-related genes, Apbb1 and Lrp1, at 4 h after irradiation, and of only one gene, Il1alpha, at 1 year after irradiation. Spatial learning ability and memory were not significantly affected at 1 or 2 years after irradiation. No induction of amyloid fibrillogenesis or changes in APP, Abeta, tau, or p-tau expression was detected at 4 months or 2 years after irradiation. TBI induced early or late transcriptional alteration in only a few AD-related genes but did not significantly affect spatial learning, memory or AD-like pathological change in mice."

Between June 1988 and December 2013, 238 patients undergoing intent-to-treat surgery for thymic epithelial tumors were reviewed. Sex, age, myasthenia gravis (MG), tumor histology, Masaoka staging, characteristic of locoregional invasion and recurrence, and the treatment for recurrence were collected. Comparison between groups was conducted using the Student t test and x2 test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. One hundred sixteen of 135 patients with completely resected thymoma and 35 of 56 patients with thymic carcinoma remained free of recurrence. In patients with completely resected thymoma, Masaoka staging, MG, tumor invasion into the lung, pericardium, and innominate vein or superior vena cava (SVC) invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.004, 0.003, 0.001, 0.007, and 0.039, respectively). In multivariate analysis, MG was the positive independent prognosticator (P=0.039). In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, Masaoka staging and innominate vein or SVC invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.045 and 0.005, respectively), whereas innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator (P=0.012). In patients with recurrent thymoma, those treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.029) and those without treatment (P=0.007). Patients with recurrent thymic carcinoma undergoing surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those without treatment (P=0.004), but not significantly better than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.252). In patients with completely resected thymoma, MG was the positive independent prognosticators of recurrence-free survival. Surgery should be attempted for recurrent disease for better post-recurrence survival. In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator. Surgery for recurrence could be considered since it provided benefit for postrecurrence survival as chemoradiotherapy did. Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
1803,Excluded,"Comparing DNA damage induced by mobile telephony and other types of man-made electromagnetic fields The number of studies showing adverse effects on living organisms induced by different types of man-made Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) has increased tremendously. Hundreds of peer reviewed published studies show a variety of effects, the most important being DNA damage which is linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive declines etc. Those studies that are far more effective in showing effects employ real-life Mobile Telephony (MT) exposures emitted by commercially available mobile phones. The present review - of results published by my group from 2006 until 2016 - compares DNA fragmentation induced by six different EMFs on the same biological system - the oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster - under identical conditions and procedures. Such a direct comparison between different EMFs - especially those employed in daily life - on the same biological endpoint, is very useful for drawing conclusions on their bioactivity, and novel. It shows that real MT EMFs are far more damaging than 50 Hz alternating magnetic field (MF) - similar or much stronger to those of power lines - or a pulsed electric field (PEF) found before to increase fertility. The MT EMFs were significantly more bioactive even for much shorter exposure durations than the other EMFs. Moreover, they were more damaging than previously tested cytotoxic agents like certain chemicals, starvation, dehydration. Individual parameters of the real MT EMFs like intensity, frequency, exposure duration, polarization, pulsing, modulation, are discussed in terms of their role in bioactivity. The crucial parameter for the intense bioactivity seems to be the extreme variability of the polarized MT signals, mainly due to the large unpredictable intensity changes.

Surgery +/- radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment. This international multicentric study aims to evaluate the outcomes of CNs patients after multimodal therapies and identify predictive factors. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with CN treated between 2005 and 2019. Treatment characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Result(s): All patients with CN underwent surgical resection. Radiotherapy was delivered in 19 patients. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 50-60 Gy). The median follow-up time was 56 months. The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS were 90% and 76%, respectively. Patients who received radiotherapy had a significantly longer PFS than patients without RT (p = 0.004) and a trend towards longer OS. In addition, complete response after treatments was associated with longer PFS (p = 0.07).

2490,Excluded,"Reduced somatosensory hand representation in thalidomide-induced dysmelia as revealed by fMRI The concept of cerebral plasticity suggests that the hand representation in somatosensory cortex is abnormal in congenital malformation disorders. To investigate this issue we studied 11 subjects with different degrees of upper extremity dysmelia due to thalidomide embryopathy in comparison to 10 control subjects. In the affected subjects fingers are typically missing in radio-ulnar order beginning with the thumb. Haemodynamic responses to electrical stimulation of the radial-most and ulnar-most fingers were measured in each subject using functional magnetic resonance tomography. The size of the hand area in the primary somatosensory cortex was estimated by calculating the Euclidian distance between corresponding activation peaks on the lateral postcentral gyrus. The cortical somatosensory hand representation was found to be significantly smaller in dysmelic subjects as compared with the control subjects (P <0.001). The shrinkage of the hand area was not proportional to the number of missing fingers. Furthermore, the cortical representation of the ulnar fingers in the dysmelic subjects was shifted towards the cortical thumb representation of the control group. We suggest that the unproportional reduction of the hand area together with the observed shift may reflect use-dependent rather than malformation-induced reorganization of the somatosensory hand area."
1187,Included,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation."
2784,Excluded,"Space, gravity and the physiology of aging: parallel or convergent disciplines? A mini-review The abnormal physiology that manifests itself in healthy humans during their adaptation to the microgravity of space has all the features of accelerated aging. The mechano-skeletal and vestibulo-neuromuscular stimuli which are below threshold in space, result in an overall greater than 10-fold more rapid onset and time course of muscle and bone atrophy in space and the development of balance and coordination problems on return to Earth than occur with aging. Similarly, the loss of functional capacity of the cardiovascular system that results in space and continuous bed rest is over 10 times faster than in the course of aging. Deconditioning in space from gravity deprivation has brought attention to the medical hazards of deconditioning on Earth from gravity withdrawal as in sedentary aging. Though seemingly reversible after periods of 6 months in space or its ground analog of bed rest, it remains to be seen whether that will be so after longer exposures. Both adaptation to space and aging do not merely parallel but converge as disorders of mechanotransduction. Like spaceflight, its analog bed rest telescopes the changes observed with aging and serves as a useful clinical model for the study of age-related deconditioning. The convergence of the disciplines of aging, along with gravitational and space physiology is advancing the understanding and prevention of modern lifestyle medical disorders."

1278,Excluded,"Evidence for a basal temporal visual language center: cortical stimulation producing pure alexia BACKGROUND: Dejerine and Benson and Geschwind postulated disconnection of the dominant angular gyrus from both visual association cortices as the basis for pure alexia, emphasizing disruption of white matter tracts in the dominant temporooccipital region. Recently functional imaging studies provide evidence for direct participation of basal temporal and occipital cortices in the cognitive process of reading. The exact location and function of these areas remain a matter of debate.OBJECTIVE: To confirm the participation of the basal temporal region in reading.METHOD: Extraoperative electrical stimulation of the dominant hemisphere was performed in three subjects using subdural electrodes, as part of presurgical evaluation for refractory epilepsy.RESULTS: Pure alexia was reproduced during cortical stimulation of the dominant posterior fusiform and inferior temporal gyri in all three patients. Stimulation resulted in selective reading difficulty with intact auditory comprehension and writing. Reading difficulty involved sentences and words with intact letter by letter reading. Picture naming difficulties were also noted at some electrodes. This region is located posterior to and contiguous with the basal temporal language area (BTLA) where stimulation resulted in global language dysfunction in visual and auditory realms. The location corresponded with the visual word form area described on functional MRI.CONCLUSION: These observations support the existence of a visual language area in the dominant fusiform and occipitotemporal gyri, contiguous with basal temporal language area. A portion of visual language area was exclusively involved in lexical processing while the other part of this region processed both lexical and nonlexical symbols."

Initially, this exposure results in a depletion of the neuroglial population. By 10 days post-irradiation (P-I), gaps occur in the glia limitans, although the overlying basal lamina remains intact. Development of and myelination by intraspinal Schwann cells is well underway by 15 days P-I. These Schwann cell-occupied regions have a paucity of astrocyte processes, a finding which persists throughout the study (60 days P-I), and several types of Schwann cell-neuroglial interfaces are observed, including: (1) astrocyte separation of Schwann cells from oligodendrocyte-myelinated regions; (2) intermingling of Schwann cell-myelinated axons and oligodendrocyte-myelinated axons in the absence of astrocyte processes; and (3) ensheathment of unmyelinated axons by astrocyte processes which separate these axons from the Schwann cells. The gaps in the glia limitans widen as the P-I interval increases. At 45 and 60 days P-I, the basal lamina no longer forms a singular, continuous covering over the spinal cord surface, but follows instead a rather tortuous course over the disrupted glia limitans and the intraspinal Schwann cells. Although the mode of initial occurrence of Schwann cells within the spinal cord is not yet understood, the data indicate that the astrocyte population is involved in that process, as well as in limiting the further development of Schwann cells within the substance of the spinal cord."

Experimental evaluation revealed that exposure to mobile phone emissions resulted in a consistent and significantly higher proportion of cell death in exposed cultures versus sham exposure (p = 0.037). Though there appears to be a repeatable trend toward higher cell mortality in magnetite-producing bacteria exposed to mobile phone emissions, it is not yet clear that this would extrapolate to a deleterious health effect in humans."
1842,Excluded,"Exploring the cost-effectiveness of thoracic radiation therapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): The recently reported Chest Radiotherapy Extensive Stage Trial (CREST) showed that administering thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) after a response to first-line chemotherapy improves 2-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival, without an increase in adverse events, in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding TRT to chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ESSCLC patients. Materials/Methods: Using a partitioned survival model, a cost-utility analysis was performed to compare strategies of TRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions via 3-D conformal RT) plus PCI versus PCI alone. The time horizon was limited to 24 months, the median follow-up of CREST. OS was partitioned into three mutually exclusive health states: alive with no progression (ANP), alive with progression (AWP), and dead. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was based on the empirical survival functions reported in CREST. Institutional treatment costs from a payer perspective were used while utilities were derived from the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed plausible ranges of uncertainty in key variables including costs, utilities, and the TRT survival benefit. Result(s): In the base-case analysis, adding TRT resulted in a $4,066 cost increase and a gain of 0.06 QALYs (0.09 LYs), yielding an ICER of $66,901/QALY ($46,568/LY). Extending the time horizon to 30 months, assuming: (1), a persistent survival benefit and (2), a declining benefit to a hazard ratio of 1, resulted in ICERs of $93,204 and $111,916/QALY respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ICER to be most sensitive to variations in ANP and AWP health state costs. The ICER was moderately sensitive to variations in TRT costs and the utility for the ANP state, but less sensitive to changes in the utility for the AWP state. Conclusion(s): Adding TRT to chemotherapy in ES-SCLC patients was found to be cost effective using commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, with an ICER lower than those of many systemic treatments for metastatic disease. Since the incremental survival benefit of TRT beyond 24 months is small, its cost-effectiveness is expected to decrease if costs remain constant."
1944,Included,"Gene expression in rat vestibular and reticular structures during and after space flight Space flight produces profound changes of neuronal activity in the mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs)] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was compared to that of ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and 1 and 14 days after landing. An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight."
1425,Included,"Tissue slice cultures from humans or rodents: a new tool to evaluate biological effects of heavy ions The aim of this interdisciplinary project is to establish slice culture preparations from rodents and humans as a new model system for studying effects of X-rays and heavy ions within normal and tumor tissues. The advantage of such slice cultures relies on the conservation of an organotypic environment, the easy treatment and observation by live-imaging microscopy, and the independence from genetic immortalization strategies used to generate cell lines. Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months. Human brain tumor slices remained vital for at least 21 days. Slices were irradiated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt/Main at doses up to 40 Gy. Heavy ion irradiations were performed at GSI (Darmstadt) with different ions, energies, and doses. The irradiated slices were analyzed by 3D-confocal microscopy following immunostaining for DNA damage, microglia, and proliferation markers. The phosphorylated histone gammaH2AX proved to be suitable for the detection of ion traversals in this system."
477,Excluded,"Value of three-dimensional computed tomography in craniomaxillofacial surgery Three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomographic (CT) scans of 72 adult patients were evaluated by two observers in a blinded fashion by comparing the 3-D images with the two-dimensional (axial and coronal) CT scans. With 3-D CT, the observers found improved visualization of facial anatomy in certain patients (i.e., asymmetries of the whole face and skull large defects of the midface and skull vault, and fractures with major dislocation). In these defects, the information can be assimilated more rapidly. The documentation of effects of cranial surgery on craniofacial growth and resorption after reconstruction with autologous material can also be evaluated more accurately. Because higher levels of radiation are used, 3-D CT protocols are less indicated in patients with minor dislocation of fractures, tumors, and inflammations. Three-dimensional CT images in these patients are of little help and can mislead the surgeon. Further improvements in hardware and software will allow more accurate surgical planning by performing interactive surgery or by producing precise models."
1065,Excluded,"Sonic Hedgehog signaling impairs ionizing radiation-induced checkpoint activation and induces genomic instability The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway plays important roles in embryogenesis, stem cell maintenance, tissue repair, and tumorigenesis. Haploinsufficiency of Patched-1, a gene that encodes a repressor of the Shh pathway, dysregulates the Shh pathway and increases genomic instability and the development of spontaneous and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced tumors by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that Ptc1(+/-) mice have a defect in the IR-induced activation of the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling pathway. Likewise, transient expression of Gli1, a downstream target of Shh signaling, disrupts Chk1 activation in human cells by preventing the interaction of Chk1 with Claspin, a Chk1 adaptor protein that is required for Chk1 activation. These results suggest that inappropriate Shh pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis by disabling a key signaling pathway that helps maintain genomic stability and inhibits tumorigenesis."
683,Included,"Locomotion and eating behavior changes in Yucatan minipigs after unilateral radio-induced ablation of the caudate nucleus The functional roles of the Caudate nucleus (Cd) are well known. Selective Cd lesions can be found in neurological disorders. However, little is known about the dynamics of the behavioral changes during progressive Cd ablation. Current stereotactic radiosurgery technologies allow the progressive ablation of a brain region with limited adverse effects in surrounding normal tissues. This could be of high interest for the study of the modified behavioral functions in relation with the degree of impairment of the brain structures. Using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy combined with synchrotron microbeam radiation, we investigated, during one year after irradiation, the effects of unilateral radio-ablation of the right Cd on the behavior of Yucatan minipigs. The right Cd was irradiated to a minimal dose of 35.5 Gy delivered in three fractions. MRI-based morphological brain integrity and behavioral functions, i.e. locomotion, motivation/hedonism were assessed. We detected a progressive radio-necrosis leading to a quasi-total ablation one year after irradiation, with an additional alteration of surrounding areas. Transitory changes in the motivation/hedonism were firstly detected, then on locomotion, suggesting the influence of different compensatory mechanisms depending on the functions related to Cd and possibly some surrounding areas. We concluded that early behavioral changes related to eating functions are relevant markers for the early detection of ongoing lesions occurring in Cd-related neurological disorders."
1356,Excluded,"Gamma Knife Surgery for Metastatic Brain Tumors from Gynecologic Cancer Objective The incidences of metastatic brain tumors from gynecologic cancer have increased. The results of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer (ovarian, endometrial, and uterine cervical cancers) were retrospectively analyzed to identify the efficacy and prognostic factors for local tumor control and survival. Methods The medical records were retrospectively reviewed of 70 patients with 306 tumors who underwent GKS for brain metastases from gynecologic cancer between January 1995 and December 2013 in our institution. Results The primary cancers were ovarian in 33 patients with 147 tumors and uterine in 37 patients with 159 tumors. Median tumor volume was 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>. Median marginal prescription dose was 20 Gy. The local tumor control rates were 96.4% at 6 months and 89.9% at 1 year. There was no statistically significant difference between ovarian and uterine cancers. Higher prescription dose and smaller tumor volume were significantly correlated with local tumor control. Median overall survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and solitary brain metastasis were significantly correlated with satisfactory overall survival. Median activities of daily living (ADL) preservation survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and higher Karnofsky Performance Status score were significantly correlated with better ADL preservation. Conclusions GKS is effective for control of tumor progression in patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer, and may provide neurologic benefits and preservation of the quality of life.

1458,Excluded,"Radiotherapy in older patients with GBM The incidence of glioblastoma in the elderly population has increased over the last few decades. Current treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy, but the optimal management of disease remains a matter of debate. RT remains an effective treatment in elderly patients with GBM and either standard RT or hypofractionated RT are associated with longer survival than supportive care only. Randomized studies comparing standard RT versus hypofractionated radiation schedules show similar survival benefits, although short-courses RT are associated with a better safety profile. Hypofractionated RT should be chosen in older patients with newly diagnosed GBM, especially in those with poor performance status or older than 70 years old. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a safe and effective treatment option alternative to RT. Recent randomized studies indicates that chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide is a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients of 60 years or older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Decisions regarding the choice between RT and TMZ chemotherapy should be based on the assessment of O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter gene. Patients with MGMT methylated tumors receive the most significant survival benefit from treatment with TMZ; by contrast, chemotherapy produces no benefit in patients with MGMT unmethylated tumors, suggesting that RT is a better option in these patients. Few studies have reported survival benefit in elderly patients treated with a combination of standard RT with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ. Although this may represent a feasible therapeutic approach in selected patients of 60-70 years old with good performance status, the potential toxicity of standard RT and chemotherapy for large irradiated brain volumes, and the modest survival advantages in this age group as compared with younger patients, do not support the use of aggressive treatments in the majority of elderly patients. An abbreviated course of RT plus TMZ may represent a feasible treatment associated with similar survival benefit and improved quality of life. Results from an EORTC large randomized study comparing a short course of RT (40 Gy in 15 daily fractions) with or without concomitant and adjuvant TMZ in elderly patients older than 65 years old with newly diagnosed GBM indicate that RT+TMZ is a safe and effective treatment in older GBM patients. Currently, several questions regarding the risks and benefit of combined chemoradiation remains unanswered."
83,Included,"Effects of Nigella sativa oil and thymoquinone on radiation-induced oxidative stress in kidney tissue of rats Ionizing radiation leads to release of free radicals into the systemic circulation from irradiated tissues. These free radicals cause oxidative stress in distant organs. Oxidative status may be reversed by naturally occurring antioxidant agents. The aim of this study was to investigate protective and antioxidant effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) and thymoquinone (TQ) in kidney tissue of rats exposed to cranial irradiation. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: IR group received irradiation (IR) to total cranium plus saline; IR plus NSO group received IR and NSO; IR plus TQ group received IR and TQ; sham group did not receive NSO, TQ or IR; control group of TQ received dimethyl sulfoxide; control group of NSO received saline. Total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels were studied as oxidative parameters, and total antioxidant status (TAS), total sulfhydryl levels, paraoxonase (PON), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and arylesterase activities were determined as antioxidative parameters in the kidney tissue of rats. Kidney TOS, OSI and LOOH levels were significantly lower in IR plus TQ, IR plus NSO and sham groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). TAS, PON and Cp activities in IR group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). PON and Cp activities were significantly higher in IR plus NSO and IR plus TQ groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). In conclusion, free radicals generated by cranial ionizing radiation exposure cause oxidative stress in kidney.

Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33). There was no difference in grade 2/3 LT complications in patients receiving adjuvant XRT between the groups (27.5% vs 27.9%, P =.97). However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups."

It is widely available and involves no exposure to ionizing radiation. Images can be acquired with a transabdominal, endovaginal, or translabial approach, and the use of video clips and three-dimensional reconstructions can be helpful. US is excellent for assessment of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Occasionally, nongynecologic pelvic diseases arising from the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems and the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces may be detected and can be a source of diagnostic dilemma. US can be helpful not only in the detection but also occasionally in the characterization of such entities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in complicated cases. In this article, the normal US appearance of the bowel and US signs of bowel disease and specific entities, including appendicitis, diverticular disease, bowel obstruction, appendiceal mucocele, and intestinal tumors, are reviewed. The lower urinary tract is included in the field of view in every pelvic US examination; commonly encountered entities related to the urinary bladder, distal ureter, and urethra are illustrated. In addition to arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, pathologic conditions in the pelvis can arise in the peritoneal or extraperitoneal space. Although conditions of the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces are rare, it is important to recognize these entities and distinguish them from the more common gynecologic diseases. Owing to the implications for diagnosis and management, radiologists and other physicians who perform pelvic US should be aware of the spectrum of nongynecologic pathologic entities that can be detected. <sup>Â©</sup>RSNA, 2017."

At our centre, the number of treatments is based on the absorbed dose (AD) to the kidneys. For logistical reasons, estimation of absorbed doses should be performed with as few measurements as possible. The aim of the present work was to study how well kidney AD and effective half-life (t<inf>eff</inf>) estimations using methods with one or two measurement points agree with the method we use today that is based on three imaging points. Material(s) and Method(s): 777 patients (333 female and 444 male) with neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. SPECT/CT over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96 and 168 h after start of infusion of<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. AD and teff were calculated using single exponential fits to data from 3 measurements (24-96-168) or two measurements (24- 96 and 24-168). In addition, absorbed doses were calculated using a single measurement, assuming t<inf>eff</inf>50 h (96/50h). Bias of AD and teff values relative to those based on the three-point measurement were calculated. To test statistical significance a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test with a P-value of 0.05 for significance was used. Median, Min and Max of the deviations were also calculated. Result(s): Bias versus AD(24-96- 168) was -3%(-20-72) (Median (Min-Max)) for AD(24-96), 3%(-22- 30) for AD(24-168) and -7%(-51-27) for AD(96/50h). The bias for teff in the AD calculations versus AD(24-96-168) was -9% (-53- 63) for AD(24-96) and 0% (-9-4) for AD(24-168). In all tests there was a small but significant difference for the whole group. In about 15% of the patients the bias in t<inf>eff</inf>was more than 20% when ignoring the 168-h scan. In about 5-10% of the patients AD differed more than 20% for all methods that excluded the 168-h measurement. Using a fixed limit of the absorbed dose to the kidneys, this would mean that these patients would be given either too many or too few treatments. Conclusion(s): Although absorbed dose calculations based on only one or two measurement points may serve as a good approximation for the majority of patients, it leads to substantial errors affecting the number of given treatments in about 10% of patients. Since this is a radiation treatment a high precision for all patients is warranted, and three measurements, or at least inclusion of a late 168-h measurement, are recommended."

597,Included,"Contrasting the effects of proton irradiation on dendritic complexity of subiculum neurons in wild type and MCAT mice Growing evidence suggests that radiation-induced oxidative stress directly affects a wide range of biological changes with an overall negative impact on CNS function. In the past we have demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing human catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) exhibit a range of neuroprotective phenotypes following irradiation that include improved neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and cognition. To determine the extent of the neuroprotective phenotype afforded by MCAT expression in different hippocampal regions, we analyzed subiculum neurons for changes in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity after exposure to low dose (0.5 Gy) 150 MeV proton irradiation. One month following irradiation of WT and MCAT mice, a range of morphometric parameters were quantified along Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons. Compared with WT mice, subiculum neurons from MCAT mice exhibited increased trends (albeit not statistically significant) toward increased dendritic complexity in both control and irradiated cohorts. However, Sholl analysis of MCAT mice revealed significantly increased arborization of the distal dendritic tree, indicating a protective effect on secondary and tertiary branching. Interestingly, radiation-induced increases in postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) puncta were not as pronounced in MCAT compared with WT mice, and were significantly lower after the 0.5 Gy dose. As past data has linked radiation exposure to reduced dendritic complexity, elevated PSD-95 and impaired cognition, reductions in mitochondrial oxidative stress have proven useful in ameliorating many of these radiation-induced sequelae. Data presented here shows similar trends, and again points to the potential benefits of reducing oxidative stress in the brain to attenuate radiation injury. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 57:364-371, 2016.

Three series of cell cultures grown on DMEM were used, including those grown on the medium enriched with 15% fetal calf serum (control 1), cultures transferred to the depleted medium containing only 0.5% of this serum (control 2), and the experimental cultures, to which SK (2000 IU/ml) was added. Addition of SK to the medium prevented a reduction of the viability of mature (14 days) dissociated neocortical cell culture from 1-2-day-old rats, induced by a transfer of the culture to a blood serum protein-deficient medium. In a 7-day culture SK potentiated the decrease in the cell viability. In organotypical cultures, with the use of electron microscopy, it was found that SK in concentration used prevented the development of destructive changes in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons of explants, induced by a deficit in serum proteins. The neurons contained numerous mitochondria, some of which had only a few cristae. Signs of destruction were observed only in neuronal nuclei. After exposure to SK for 48 hours an activation of oligodendrocytes (containing numerous myelin bodies) was noted which was accompanied by astrocyte disintegration (with hyperchromatic nuclei in the remaining cells). The neurons were resistant to SK exposure."
3027,Excluded,"CT-aided low-count whole-body PET imaging using cross-modality attention pyramid network Objectives: Reducing either the administered dose or scan time of PET imaging is desirable as it decreases the radiation exposure to the patient or can improve patient comfort as well as minimize motion artifact. However, the trade-off of these benefits are low overall counts and increased noise, adversely impacting image contrast and quantification. To enable low dose or shorten the PET scan while maintaining the high signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient image quality, we propose a novel method to integrate CT into a deep learning framework to aid the estimation of diagnostic quality PET images from low-count ultra-short PET scans. Method(s): We propose a cross-modality attention pyramid network (CMAPN) to generate diagnostic quality PET images from low-count PET images with the help of CT from PET/CT scans. Twenty subjects with whole-body PET/CT were used to estimate synthetic diagnostic PET images from a low-count training set using 1/8th of the normal scanning time (19 vs. 162 seconds/bed). CMAPN learns to translate a low-count PET image into a synthetic full-count PET image resembling the one from a high-quality diagnostic standard clinical protocol. At the training stage, independent 3D patch-based deep features were extracted from low-count PET and CT images using two separate PET synthesis sub-networks. The two sub-networks share the same pyramid network architecture. A low-count PET-only synthesis loss, and a CT-only synthesis loss were calculated between the outputs of the two sub-networks. The two losses would allow independent and relevant features to be extracted from low-count PET and CT images for the prediction of full-count PET images. The cross-modal deep features from the two subnetworks were subsequently combined to estimate a final full-count PET image. Feature maps of corresponding pyramid levels were first concatenated and then highlighted via attention gates. The network was trained by minimizing a combination of losses, including a low-count PET-only synthesis loss, a CT-only synthesis loss and a final synthesis loss. At the testing stage, paired low-count PET and CT image patches were first extracted from the original images. These image patch pairs were then inputted into the trained CMAPN to obtain the synthetic full-count PET patches. Finally, the synthetic full-count PET image patches were fused to predict the final whole-body full-count PET images. These synthetic PET images were then compared to the original diagnostic PET images for evaluation. The proposed method was tested using a leaveone-out cross-validation method. Mean error (ME), normalized mean square error (NMSE), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used to quantify the differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. Result(s): The average ME, NMSE, NCC and PSNR in the whole body were 0.20+/-1.01% and 0.67+/-0.28%, 0.994+/-0.004% and 46.2+/-2.8dB for all patients. There were no significant differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. In a volume of interest, such as the brain, lung, heart, kidneys, and liver, the overall ME was less than 2.5% and the NMSE was less than 1.5% for all patients. Lesion-based ME and NMSE were less than 5% for all patients. Conclusion(s): We have developed a novel CT-aided estimation method for synthetic full-count PET images using CMAPN. The proposed method could generate diagnostic quality PET datasets from ultra-short (1/8th count, 19 seconds/bed) PET scans. The organ boundary definition of the generated PET has improved due to the use of CT images in CMAPN. The proposed method has great potential to improve the quality of low-count PET scans for future implementation of low dose or fast scan PET imaging in the clinic."

Result(s): 13 patients fulfilled the criteria. 11 patients were initially diagnosed with early stage (Stage I-III). 11 patients received concurrent chemo radiation (Nigro regimen or cisplatin + 5-FU) and had reoccurrence. 2 patients were initially diagnosed with Stage IV disease. Median age was 56 years and 77% were females. Upon diagnosis of metastatic disease, 11 patients received prior chemotherapy (cisplatin/5FU, irinotecan/cetuximab, cisplatin/docetaxel). 4/13 patients received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, 7/13 received only 1 prior regimen and 2/13 did not receive any prior chemotherapy. Patients received an average of 4.7 cycles (1 cycle= 3 weeks). Median was 4 cycles. The response rate was high at 62% with 2 patients achieving complete response and 6 patients with partial response. Grade 3 toxicities included peripheral neuropathy (n= 3), diarrhea (n= 1), and infection (n=3). 4 patients had grade 3 neutropenia and 1 patient had grade 4 anemia. Median progression free survival and overall survival were 4.6 and 10.5 months respectively. Conclusion(s): Carboplatin and paclitaxel seem to be well tolerated and have activity in the treatment of advanced SCC of the anal canal. Larger studies need to be conducted to validate these findings."
2103,Excluded,"Medical Event Management for Future Deep Space Exploration Missions to Mars BACKGROUND: Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), such as voyages to Mars, will present unique medical challenges for astronaut crews, including communication delays and the inability to return to Earth early. Medical events threaten crewmember lives and increase the risk of mission failure. Managing a range of potential medical events will require excellent technical and nontechnical skills (NTSs). We sought to identify medical events with potential for rescue, range them according to the potential impact on crew health and mission success during LDEMs, and develop a list of NTSs to train for management of in-flight medical events.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subject matter experts with specializations in surgery, medicine, trauma, spaceflight operations, NTS training, simulation, human factors, and organizational psychology completed online surveys followed by a 2-d in-person workshop. They identified and rated medical events for survivability, mission impact, and impact of crewmember NTSs on outcomes in space.RESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest, smoke inhalation, toxic exposure, seizure, and penetrating eye injury emerged as events with the highest potential mission impact, greatest potential for survival, and that required excellent NTS for successful management. Key NTS identified to target in training included information exchange, supporting behavior, communication delivery, and team leadership/followership.CONCLUSIONS: With a planned Mars mission on the horizon, training countermeasures need to be developed in the next 3-5 y. These results may inform policy, selection, medical system design, and training scenarios for astronauts to manage in-flight medical events on LDEMs. Findings may extend to surgical and medical care in any rural and remote location."
1005,Excluded,"Comparison of 3 Tesla proton MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion and MR diffusion for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects Purpose: To compare 3 Tesla (3T) multi-voxel and single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (MRS), dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI (DSC), and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for distinguishing recurrent glioma from postradiation injury. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed all 3T MRS, DSC and DWI studies performed for suspicion of malignant glioma recurrence between October 2006 and December 2008. Maximum Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr peak-area and peak-height ratios were recorded for both multi-voxel and single-voxel MRS. Maximum cerebral blood volume (CBV) and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were normalized to white matter. Histopathology and clinical-radiologic follow-up served as reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves for each parameter were compared. Result(s): Forty lesions were classified as glioma recurrence (n = 30) or posttreatment effect (n = 10). Diagnostic performance was similar for CBV ratio (AUC = 0.917, P < 0.001), multi-voxel Cho/Cr peak-area (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), and multi-voxel Cho/NAA peak-height (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), while ADC ratio (AUC = 0.726, P = 0.035) did not appear to perform as well. Single-voxel MRS parameters did not reliably distinguish tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Conclusion(s): A 3T DSC and multi-voxel MRS Cho/Cr peak-area and Cho/NAA peak-height appear to outperform DWI for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects. Single-voxel MRS parameters do not appear to distinguish glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects reliably, and therefore should not be used in place of multi-voxel MRS.

1146,Excluded,"Different mechanisms may generate sustained hypertonic and rhythmic bursting muscle activity in idiopathic dystonia Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients with medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are largely unclear. In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes. In 5 dystonic patients with mobile involuntary movements, rhythmic EMG bursts in the contralateral muscles were coherent with the oscillations in the pallidal LFPs at the burst frequency. In contrast, no significant coherence was seen between EMG and LFPs either for the sustained activity separated out from the compound EMGs in those 5 cases, or in the EMGs in 3 other cases without mobile involuntary movements and rhythmic EMG bursts. In comparison with the resting condition, in both active and passive movements, significant modulation in the GPi LFPs was seen in the range of 8-16 Hz. The finding of significant coherence between GPi oscillations and rhythmic EMG bursts but not sustained tonic EMG activity suggests that the synchronized pallidal activity may be directly related to the rhythmic involuntary movements. In contrast, the sustained hypertonic muscle activity may be represented by less synchronized activity in the pallidum. Thus, the pallidum may play different roles in generating different components of the dystonic symptom complex."
2694,Included,"Specificity in the response of the mammalian methylome to ionizing radiation Environmental epigenetics is the study of how exposures interact with the epigenome to cause stable epigenetic change, most notably changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here we asked whether the response of the mouse epigenome to ionizing radiation is specific or non-specific. We used meDIP-seq to examine radiation-induced changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) throughout the genome. To examine tissue specificity, we compared the methylomes of heart and brain tissue 22 weeks after exposure to protons. We found 5mC and 5hmC changes that mapped to genes with cardiovascular functions in the heart and with neuronal functions in the brain. We also compared two forms of ionizing radiation, the sparsely ionizing protons and densely ionizing 56Fe ions. Both are components of galactic cosmic radiation, which is a concern for astronauts flying deep space missions. Specifically, we asked whether protons and 56Fe ions would produce similar DNA methylation changes in the brain at 4 weeks post exposure, and found significant overlap for both 5mC and 5hmC changes. Interestingly, gene expression changes in the brain at 4 weeks were linked to changes in 5hmC at promoter regions, but not 5mC, and these linked changes mapped to neuronal ontology pathways. Further, a novel form of 5hmC change along gene bodies was observed and mapped mostly to postsynaptic pathways. Finally, the extent of 56Fe ion-induced behavioral change correlated inversely with DNA methylation change suggesting that the epigenomic response to radiation was part of the repair process to mitigate its toxic effects."
2718,Excluded,"Clinical Evaluation of a Rotational Set-up Correction Device for Multiple Brain Metastases Using Single-Isocenter Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) using a single plan with one isocenter by helical tomotherapy (HT) can simultaneously treat multiple brain metastases with highly conformal dose distributions. This may reduce treatment time and intra-fractional motion. However, rotational set-up errors in the pitch and yaw angles cannot be corrected in the HT system. Therefore, increases in rotational set-up error and distance of the target-to-rotational-center may be associated with significant dosimetric uncertainties with this irradiation technique. Previous research shows that when rotational errors are increased to 2.0degree, the prescription doses which cover 95% of the planning target volume were only 63% of all tested cases. Here, we developed a new head supporting device that allows for a highly-accurate correction of rotational errors during image-guided radiation therapy. In this study, we investigated the amounts of rotational correction required prior to irradiation, and evaluated the dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction for SRT, using HT unit to treat multiple brain metastases. Materials/Methods: A novel rotational set-up correction device was constructed from carbon material and conjected with the commonly-used head shell system on the top of our device. We were able to rotate in 0.1degree increments for pitch and yaw angles using two screws. We retrospectively analyzed data from three patients irradiated by single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases using the HT unit. The SRT plans were created with 30 Gy in three fractions prescribed for D99% to clinical target volumes. The required rotational correction values were determined by mega-voltage computed tomography (MVCT) before irradiation. Residual correction values were quantified after correction by the developed device. Moreover, dosimetric efficacy was evaluated using the calculated dose distribution with MVCT after rotational correction. Dose distribution was compared between 4D (three horizontal axes + roll) and 6D correction. We clarified efficacy of rotational correction depending on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. Result(s): The rotational correction for pitch was 1.2degree +/- 1.7degree, roll: 0.9degree +/- 1.2degree, and yaw: 1.3degree +/- 1.6degree. The maximum correction value in pitch and yaw was 3.0degree. The residual correction value after rotational correction was 0.2degree +/- 0.3degree in both pitch and yaw angles. The difference in target dose between 4D and 6D corrections was improved by 2.5% in coverage index, and 1.0% on D99%. Dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction did not depend on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. This suggests that irradiated doses for brain metastases in any location can be improved. Conclusion(s): Novel rotational set-up correction device can be corrected to within 0.5degree in pitch and yaw angle error, and benefited rotational correction and irradiated dose distribution for single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases.

168,Excluded,"Stereotactic navigation for TAMIS-TME: opening the gateway to frameless, image-guided abdominal and pelvic surgery Background: Frameless stereotaxy is an established method for real-time image-guided surgical navigation in neurological surgery. Though this is capable of providing sub-millimeter accuracy, it has not been used by other surgical specialists. Methods and procedure: A patient with locally advanced, distal rectal cancer and tumor abutting the prostate was selected for transanal TME using TAMIS, with intra-operative CT-guided navigation to ensure an R0 resection. Result(s): The use of stereotactic TAMIS-TME was successfully performed with an accuracy of +/-4 mm. The surgical specimen revealed an R0 resection, and this new approach aided in achieving adequate resection margins. Conclusion(s): This is the first report of the use of frameless stereotactic navigation beyond the scope of neurosurgery. Stereotactic navigation for transanal total mesorectal excision is shown to be feasible. Stereotactic navigation may potentially be applied toward other pelvic and fixed abdominal organs, thereby opening the gateway for a broader use by the general surgeon.

972,Excluded,"Computer aided diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease, Myocardial Infarction and carotid atherosclerosis using ultrasound images: A review The diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Myocardial Infarction (MI) and carotid atherosclerosis is of paramount importance, as these cardiovascular diseases may cause medical complications and large number of death. Ultrasound (US) is a widely used imaging modality, as it captures moving images and image features correlate well with results obtained from other imaging methods. Furthermore, US does not use ionizing radiation and it is economical when compared to other imaging modalities. However, reading US images takes time and the relationship between image and tissue composition is complex. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy depends on both time taken to read the images and experience of the screening practitioner. Computer support tools can reduce the inter-operator variability with lower subject specific expertise, when appropriate processing methods are used. In the current review, we analysed automatic detection methods for the diagnosis of CAD, MI and carotid atherosclerosis based on thoracic and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS). We found that IVUS is more often used than thoracic US for CAD. But for MI and carotid atherosclerosis IVUS is still in the experimental stage. Furthermore, thoracic US is more often used than IVUS for computer aided diagnosis systems."
1890,Excluded,"Direct Parametric Reconstruction for Improved Characterization of Neurotransmitter Release using Dynamic PET Objectives: Kinetic analyses of dynamic PET data with reversibly binding receptor-ligand radiotracers can be used to detect endogenous neurotransmitter (NT) releases elicited by cognitive tasks or drug stimulation. Conventionally, NT release is characterized by fitting time-activity curves (TACs) with an appropriate kinetic model such as LSRRM (Alpert et al 2003), an extension of the simplified reference region model that incorporates time-varying binding due to tracer displacement by NT. A limitation of this 'indirect' approach, however, is the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the estimated parametric images. In the current work, we developed a method for estimation of LSRRM parametric maps with significantly higher SNR by direct parameter estimation from raw dynamic PET projection data. We conducted simulation and human C-raclopride studies to evaluate the performance of this method against the standard indirect method. Method(s): A numerical phantom comprised of 22 different brain regions including 7 striatal sub-divisions was created using the MNI atlas. Kinetic parameters values were assigned to each brain region based on measurements performed on 16 subjects studied with C-raclopride. Dopamine (DA) release was simulated in the striatum (executive area). LSRRM was used to generate the corresponding 4-D (i.e., 3-D + time) activity images which were then forward-projected to produce noise-free dynamic sinograms. Attenuation, detector sensitivity, point spread function and radioactive decay were modeled during sinogram data generation. After scaling to standard counts levels, Poisson noise was added to the sinograms to achieve noise levels comparable to our human studies. For empirical evaluation, a 45-min human study was conducted on the Siemens mMR camera using C-raclopride (13.5mCi). A reward task was started ~27 min after radiotracer injection to induce striatal DA release. For both simulation and human studies, parametric images of binding potential with non-displaceable reference (BP<inf>ND</inf>) and magnitude of DA release (gamma) were computed using the indirect method and the proposed direct method. For the indirect approach, parameters were estimated by pixel-wise application of LSRRM using the cerebellum as a reference tissue input and weighted least-squares fitting of TACs obtained following fully-3D dynamic OSEM reconstruction. No post-reconstruction smoothing was included. For the direct method, parameters were directly estimated from the dynamic sinograms by preconditioned conjugate gradient based optimization of a four-dimensional Poisson log-likelihood objective function incorporating LSRRM kinetics and accounting for the effects of attenuation, sensitivity, scatter and randoms. Result(s): In simulation studies, the indirect method estimated striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma with 7.8% and 79.2% bias, respectively. For the direct reconstruction, bias was reduced to 6.9% and 5.5% for striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates, respectively. Coefficients of variation ('CV', i.e. pixel-wise variability) of striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates were 65.3% and 72.0% for the indirect method as compared to 17.4% and 17.9% for the direct method. Likewise, in the human study, the direct method yielded BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma images with improved SNR. CV of BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates in the putamen were 71.4% and 91.4% for the indirect method and 32.9% and 37.6% for the direct method. Conclusion(s): Direct reconstruction can reduce bias and increase the SNR of parametric images. The method has the potential to improve the characterization of localized neurotransmitter release, potentially allowing detection of weaker effects, reducing the needed sample size, or reducing radioactivity dose to facilitate repeated experiments or minimize radiation exposure."
2097,Excluded,"Avoidance of radiation induced alopecia en whole brain radiotherapy treatments with simultaneous integrated boost Purpose/Objective: Radiation-induced alopecia in hypofractionated whole brain radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost (WBRT+SIB) is an understudied issue, even in RTOG 9508. However, this effect has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients. We have currently found a technical solution to this problem. Our current protocol for WBRT+SIB is presented and described, incluiding a retrospective review of the results in relation to radiation-induced alopecia. Material(s) and Method(s): The protocol already implemented in our department is based on a frame-less procedure compatible with masks of type 35764/2MA/M (Orfit Industries N.V., Wijnegem, Belgium), submasks of eXaSkin (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain) and a resonance compatible frame eXaFrame (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain). CT and MR studies of 1mm slice thickness are acquired with similar length, position and inmovilization. The whole procedure and the resulting high quality fussion is ensured by the eXaFrame system. Treatments were designed using VMAT in Treatment System Planning Pinnacle V.9.2 (Philips N.V, Koninklijke Holland) with multiple arcs, and delivered with a linear accelerator Elekta Synergy (Elekta A.B., Stockholm, Sweden). The dose scheme used is the one reported by Lagerwaard: [WBRT(20Gy) + SIBmts (40Gy)]/5 fr. Patient positioning is verified daily using IGRT with Elekta XVI, before and after treatment. Before optimization is performed, some auxiliary volumes are created: a 3mm ring around calota,called Follicles, and a volume contracted 12mm from the outer one, called CPE. Two CCW VMAT arcs (178degree to 60degree and 300degree to 182degree) are added, with the following objectives: Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 1), brain-CPE (D<inf>max</inf>= 21 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 20 Gy, weight = 50), eyes(D<inf>max</inf>= 10 Gy, weight = 1). Thereafter, we work separately on the metastases blocking the optimization of the prophylaxis and creating three structures: VI1 = PTV (MTS1)+ 5 mm, VI2 = PTV (MTS2)+ 5 mm, Epx = brain-VI1-VI2. Objectives were: PTVI (D<inf>max</inf>= 44 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 40 Gy weight = 50), Epx (D<inf>max</inf>= 30 Gy) ,brain stem (D<inf>max</inf>= 23 Gy) and Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 20). Result(s): We have treated 14 patients until now. Fusion images have shown differences less than 1mm while mean IGRT correction has been 1.34mm. No acute toxicity have been observed, including neither alopecia nor temporal depilation. Conclusion(s): This protocol has been designed and developed in our hospital, considering the alopecia as toxicity in VMAT optimization. It produces excellent cosmetic results, avoiding alopecia in practically all cases, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. As a general consideration, we would like to point out that that it should be considered mandatory to use all advanced tools available on modern radiotherapy to minimize toxicity in radiation treatments."
3,Excluded,"Investigating molecular biomarkers in SCLC Aim: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer that relapses quickly after conventional treatment. Molecular biomarkers have been investigated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and targeted treatments in advanced disease are established. Currently there are no established targeted therapies in SCLC and the aim of this study was to examine for the presence of known molecular targets in patients with SCLC. Method(s): A panel of histopathologically proven formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens of SCLC diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 were analysed for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF mutations, ALK gene rearrangements and MET amplification. EGFR and KRAS testing were done using real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR cobas), BRAF and NRAS using capillary electrophoresis-single strand conformation analysis (CE-SSCA) and ALK and MET using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Any positive results were repeated for confirmation. Any inconsistent results were sequenced using the direct Sanger sequencing. . Result(s): A hundred and five cases of SCLC were identified and 75 FFPE blocks retrieved. Sixty samples were suitable for molecular testing, with 25 examined for all 6 molecular targets successfully. No mutations in EGFR were detected in 31 cases suitable for analysis. KRAS and NRAS mutational analysis was successful in 35 and 37 cases respectively; all of which were wild type. Fifty-eight cases were assessed for ALK gene rearrangements and 42 cases for MET gene amplifications; no rearrangements or amplifications were detected. Forty-seven samples were successfully analysed for BRAF gene mutation, with one V600E mutation detected (2.1% of cases). This patient was a 55 years old Caucasian male smoker who was diagnosed as SCLC, limited stage. He had a history of squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed 6 months prior to the SCLC diagnosis (treated by lobectomy). He responded well to his SCLC treatment (radical chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation). He died nine months after diagnosis. Conclusion(s): EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, ALK and MET were not detected in the examined panel of SCLC patients. A BRAF mutation was identified in a single patient with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, suggesting a mixed pathology tumour rather than a biomarker in SCLC. This panel of biomarkers should no longer be explored in SCLC."
1437,Excluded,"Location of glioblastoma intersectiing white matter tracts predict patient prognosis and response to bevacizumab prior to therapy INTRODUCTION: Brain tumors are known to invade healthy brain along white matter tracts. We therefore hypothesized that specific white matter tracts would be associated with poorer prognosis based on their connection to primitive brain regions necessary for essential life functions. We also hypothesized that tumors in these regions treated with bevacizumab would alter patient survival. METHOD(S): 109 subjects with primary GBM tumors were retrospectively included in this study. Voxel-wise survival analyses were performed to test for spatial and treatment dependence of GBM survival prognosis. An intersection analysis was first performed between an enhancing tumor mask and template-space diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived tractography which highlighted voxels with tumor-intersecting white matter tracts. Maps of voxels with these tracts were made for each patient. A voxel-wise Kaplan-Meier test was performed comparing the survival times of patients with and without a tumor-intersecting white matter tract in that voxel. The same analysis was implemented to compare survival of participants with and without bevacizumab. This highlighted regions where survival was effected due to anti-VEGF treatment. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to validate the observed survival differences induced by bevacizumab considering inconsistencies in treatment regimens seen in the patient population. RESULT(S): Glioblastoma patients with tumors intersecting the right anterior thalamic radiation, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral corticospinal tracts, and corpus callosum have decreased survival compared to those with tumors intersecting elsewhere. Patients treated with bevacizumab and who also had tumors intersecting the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, or the thalamic radiations were found to be at a survival advantage when compared to those who did not receive bevacizumab. CONCLUSION(S): Patient prognosis is associated with the location of tumor intersecting WM tracts. A survival advantage was found in tumors intersecting specific WM tracts treated with bevacizumab."
2202,Excluded,"Influence of backscatter radiation on cranial reconstruction implants Objective: We aimed to evaluate backscatter dose variations in different cranial bone implant materials in an experimental model designed to simulate postoperative radiotherapy. Method(s): We assessed the radiation backscatter doses associated with sheet- and mesh-type titanium plates and hydroxyapatite (HAP) samples (porosity: 35%, 50% and 85%). The samples were irradiated with 6- and 10-MV photon beams from a linear accelerator. Measurements were obtained using an ionization chamber and radiochromic films cut from the same batch. Result(s): At 6MV, the titanium sheet showed the highest peak for backscattered radiation, followed by (in decreasing order) HAP30%, HAP50%, titanium mesh and HAP85%. At 10MV, HAP30% showed the highest peak, followed by HAP50%, titanium sheet, titanium mesh and HAP85%. The peaks were at different depths in the titanium and HAP samples. The thickness of the human scalp is approximately 7mm; therefore, measurements were obtained 0-7mm above the implants to assess the likely dose on the scalp. A comparison of the maximum dose on the scalp showed the titanium sheet had the highest dose at both 6 and 10MV. Conclusion(s): The backscatter dose differed with the density of the material and the backscatter depth was different for each material. Advances in knowledge: Ulcer formation due to radiotherapy after brain tumour depends on not only radiation but also the implant material. Therefore, the density and type of implant material should be considered when planning radiotherapy and selecting bone reconstruction materials. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

1779,Excluded,"Evaluation of absorbed dose in respiratory-gated radiotherapy using a phantom system that simulates patient respiration. [Japanese] Respiratory-gated (RG) radiotherapy is useful for minimizing the irradiated volume of normal tissues resulting from the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. In this technique, although improvement in the dose distribution of the target can be expected, the actual absorbed dose distribution is not clearly determined. Therefore, it is important to clarify the absorbed dose at the tumor and at the evaluation points according to the patient's respiration. We have developed a phantom system that simulates patient respiration (TNK Co., Ltd.), to evaluate the absorbed dose and ensure precise RG radiotherapy. Actual patient respiratory signals were obtained using a respiratory synchronization and gating system (AZ-733V, Anzai Medical). The acquired data were then transferred to a phantom system driven by a ball screw to simulate the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. We measured the absorbed dose using a micro-ionization chamber dosimeter and the dose distribution using the film method for RG irradiation at expiratory phase by using Linac (PRIMUS, Toshiba Medical Systems Corp.) X-rays. When the distance of phantom movement was set to the average patient respiratory movement distance of 1.5 cm, we first compared absorbed dose with RG irradiation with a gating signal of 50% or less, and without RG irradiation. The absorbed dose at the iso-center was improved by 6.0% and 4.4% at a field size of 4x4 cm2, and by 1.3% and 0.7% at a field size of 5x5 cm2 with an X-ray energy of 6 MV and 10 MV, respectively. There was, however, no dose change at a field size of 10x10 cm2 and 15x15 cm2. When the gating signal was reduced to 25% and 10%, absorbed dose was also improved. With regard to the flatness of the dose profile, no changes in dose distribution were observed in the lateral direction, e.g., beam flatness was within 1.4% and 1.6% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively, with an X-ray energy of 6 MV. In the cranial-caudal direction, the dose profile was relatively large even if a gating signal of 50% was applied, i.e., 8.1% and 10.4% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. Beam flatness without RG was much worse, i.e., 37.8% and 38.2%, at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. In both cases, the dose was insufficient in the expiratory direction. Although RG radiotherapy is quite useful, the margins in the inspiratory and expiratory phases should be considered based on the level of gating signal and field size in order to formulate appropriate radiotherapy planning in terms of the shifting of internal structures. To ensure accurate radiotherapy, the characteristics of the RG irradiation technique and the radiotherapy equipment must be clearly understood when this technique is to be employed in clinical practice."
2352,Excluded,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors."
2268,Excluded,"The CNS germinoma experience at UCSF from 1980 - 2010 Background/Aims. Management for CNS germinomas is controversial. Historically, treatment involved craniospinal irradiation (CSI). For intracranial lesions, however, early evidence suggests that focal radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy may achieve high local control rates and limit radiation toxicity. This study examines the efficacy of treatment approaches in the management of CNS germinoma patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Methods. Seventy-nine patients who received primary treatment for germinoma between 1980 and 2010 at UCSF were identified and their charts reviewed. Primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results. 29 patients were treated with XRT alone and 50 with XRT and chemotherapy. 22 patients received focal XRT, 32 received whole brain irradiation (WBI) and 9 received CSI. Field data was unrecoverable for 16 patients. 14 patients progressed and 8 died from disease. PFS rate at 5 years was 87.7% and OS rate at 5 years was 93.0%. Overall, focal XRT had significantly higher rates of disease progression compared to WBI or CSI (p - 0.047 and p - 0.008 respectively) and among patients who had solitary lesions, focal XRT and chemotherapy had significantly higher rates of disease progression (p - 0 .024) than WBI and chemotherapy. Conclusion. Among all CNS germinoma patients, CSI or WBI achieve better control rates than focal XRT. specifically for solitary intracranial lesions, WBI and chemotherapy is superior to focal XRT and chemotherapy as it is associated with significantly lower rates of progression."
3087,Excluded,"High-level production of alpha-particle-emitting (211)At and preparation of (211)At-labeled antibodies for clinical use UNLABELLED: In vitro and in vivo studies in human glioma models suggest that the antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 labeled with the 7.2-h-half-life alpha-particle emitter (211)At might be a valuable endoradiotherapeutic agent for the treatment of brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to develop methods for the production of high levels of (211)At and the radiosynthesis of clinically useful amounts of (211)At-labeled human/mouse chimeric 81C6 antibody.METHODS: (211)At was produced through the (209)Bi(alpha, 2n)(211)At reaction using an internal target system and purified by a dry distillation process. Antibody labeling was accomplished by first synthesizing N-succinimidyl 3-[(211)At]astatobenzoate from the corresponding tri-n-butyl tin precursor and reacting it with the antibody in pH 8.5 borate buffer. Quality control procedures consisted of methanol precipitation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and pyrogen and sterility assays, as well as determination of the immunoreactive fraction by a rapid procedure using a recombinant tenascin fragment coupled to magnetic beads.RESULTS: A total of 16 antibody labeling runs were performed. Using beam currents of 50-60 microA alpha-particles and irradiation times of 1.5-4.5 h, the mean (211)At production yield was 27.75 +/- 2.59 MBq/microA.h, and the maximum level of (211)At produced was 6.59 GBq after a 4-h irradiation at 55 microA. The decay-corrected distillation yield was 67% +/- 16%. The yield for the coupling of the (211)At-labeled active ester to the antibody was 76% +/- 8%. The fraction of (211)At activity that eluted with a retention time corresponding to intact IgG on HPLC was 96.0% +/- 2.5%. All preparations had a pyrogen level of <0.125 EU/mL and were determined to be sterile. The mean immunoreactive fraction for these 16 preparations was 83.3% +/- 5.3%. Radiolysis did not interfere with labeling chemistry or the quality of the labeled antibody product.CONCLUSION: These results show that it is feasible to produce clinically relevant activities of (211)At-labeled antibodies and have permitted the initiation of a phase I trial of (211)At-labeled chimeric 81C6 administered directly into the tumor resection cavities of brain tumor patients."

Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity. While its nuclear translocation and ATM/ATR dependence were similar to hp53, the cytoplasmic localization and subdued accumulation following gamma-irradiation indicate functional differences from human cells."
1500,Excluded,"Treatment of pituitary tumors: Radiation In this paper, the role of conventional radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the management of pituitary tumors is reviewed. After a short summary of the mechanism of action of irradiation therapy and the types of different irradiation techniques, the therapeutic effects and side effects are analyzed in patients with different types of pituitary tumors, including our own experience with conventional radiotherapy and radiosurgery in patients with acromegaly. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has long been used to control growth and/or hormonal secretion of residual or recurrent pituitary tumors. However, patient selection for conventional radiotherapy still remains a controversial issue, because a number of potentially significant side effects, including hypopituitarism and other complications, have been described. Stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery methods have several potential advantages over conventional radiotherapy, including their use in patients with residual or recurrent pituitary tumors who had previously been treated by conventional radiotherapy, but long-term follow-up data with these relatively new techniques are still limited.

2259,Excluded,"Electric field stimulation of precision-cut lung slices The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) technique is widely used to examine airway responses in different species. We developed a method to study nerve-dependent bronchoconstriction by the application of electric field stimulation (EFS) to PCLS. PCLS prepared from Wistar rats were placed between two platinum electrodes to apply serial rectangular impulses (5-100 Hz), and bronchoconstriction was studied by videomicroscopy. The extent of airway contractions increased with higher frequencies. Stable repeated airway contractions were obtained at a frequency of 50 Hz, a width of 1 ms, and an output of 200 mA for 2.5 s each minute. Larger airways showed stronger responses. The EFS-triggered contractions were increased by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine (10 muM) and reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 muM), whereas the thromboxane protanoid receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 muM) had no effect. Magnesium ions (10 mM) antagonized airway contractions induced by EFS, but not by methacholine, indicating that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS. Our data further show that the electrically evoked airway contractions in PCLS are mediated by cholinergic nerves, independent of thromboxane and more prominent in larger airways. Taken together these findings show that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS, and they suggest that the present method is useful to study neurogenic responses in airways of different size.

351,Excluded,"Cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma followed by irradiation in patients with regional disease Forty-four patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung were treated every 3 weeks with vinblastine (4 mg/m2/day iv X 2) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day iv X 3). Of the 28 patients with metastatic disease, eight (29%; 90% confidence interval of true response, 17%-47%) achieved objective response, for a median duration of 27 weeks. Median survival in this group was 47 and 28 weeks for responders and nonresponders, respectively. Of the 16 patients with advanced regional disease, 11 (69%; 90% confidence interval of true response, 49%-86%) achieved objective response. Thirteen of these patients received consolidation radiotherapy (4500 cGy/25 fractions/5 weeks), with a boost of 1000 cGy/5 fractions/1 week in those patients who achieved response. In the three patients who did not receive radiotherapy, two died during the induction phase, one from grade 4 leukopenia and sepsis and the second from unrelated factors. The third patient had systemic progression of disease during induction chemotherapy. Six patients experienced overall improvement in their chemotherapy response from the radiotherapy. Two patients who did not respond to the chemotherapy achieved partial response with irradiation. Four patients who had partial response to the chemotherapy achieved complete response with irradiation, and seven patients had no further change in their degree of response to irradiation. The overall median survival of this group was 81 weeks. Maintenance chemotherapy was not given. After radiotherapy, the site of first failure was outside the radiation field in nine of 13 patients (69%). Hematologic toxicity was dose-limiting. Other toxic effects that were not dose-limiting included nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and acute nausea and vomiting. In the patients with advanced regional disease, there was no increase in the radiation toxicity attributable to the chemotherapy. We conclude that: (a) this dose schedule of vinblastine and cisplatin has reproducible activity in non-small cell carcinoma of the lung; (b) the response and median survival of patients with advanced regional disease are superior to those of patients with metastatic disease; and (c) in patients with advanced regional disease, treatment with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 81% (90% confidence interval of true response, 60%-93%) and improved survival compared to a similar group of patients studied by others receiving radiotherapy alone. We recommend further testing of this concept."
582,Excluded,"Single-neuron perturbations reveal feature-specific competition in V1 The computations performed by local neural populations, such as a cortical layer, are typically inferred from anatomical connectivity and observations of neural activity. Here we describe a method-influence mapping-that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre-surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron's influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron's preferred stimulus, by around 2%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations."
2272,Included,"Dose-responses from multi-model inference for the non-cancer disease mortality of atomic bomb survivors The non-cancer mortality data for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular diseases from Report 13 on the atomic bomb survivors published by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation were analysed to investigate the dose-response for the influence of radiation on these detrimental health effects. Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data. Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that all fitted the data about equally well. Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice. This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties. For CVD, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses. The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose. For mortalities related to cardiovascular diseases, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals. The MMI approach described here resolves a dilemma in practical radiation protection when one is forced to select between models with profoundly different dose-responses for risk estimates."

2919,Excluded,"Additional radiation exposure and fluoroscopy time in patients treated for tandem occlusions in the anterior circulation - A matched-pair analysis Background: Since radiation exposure in interventional radiology is of growing interest and the number of performed endovascular stroke treatments (EST), i. e. mechanical thrombectomy (MT)-is increasing, the demand of dose reference levels (DRL) is growing. This study was performed to quantify the additional radiation exposure (RE) and fluoroscopy time (FT) needed in patients treated for a tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation compared to patients without a preceding carotid artery occlusion or stenosis receiving EST. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained stroke database of a comprehensive stroke center focusing on the RE (as per dose area product in muGy*m2, median [IQR]), procedure and FT (in minutes, median [IQR]) in patients receiving carotid artery stenting (CAS) and MT in the anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Patients who received CAS and MT were matched with patients needing only MT according to number of thrombectomy maneuvers, location of intracranial occlusion, mode of anesthesia, gender and age (order of decreasing priority). Ergebnisse: Overall 236 patients (n = 118 in each group) have been included in this analysis. Additionally to matching criteria, there was no significant difference in patient's pre-morbid degree of disability (as per modified Rankin Scale), initial severity of stroke symptoms (as per National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), and administration of i. v. rtPA or time from stroke onset to groin puncture in patients with known symptom onset. Procedure times (CAS+: 121 [80-176]; CAS-: 66 [45-106]), fluoroscopy times (CAS+: 57 [37-88]; CAS-: 3 2 [20-53]) as well as radiation exposure (CAS+: 19042 [13603-28722]; CAS-: 12379 [9307-18969]) were significantly higher in patients receiving CAS (all p-values: <0.0001). This is a relative median increase of radiation exposure of 53.8% and a relative increase of 78.2% of fluoroscopy time. Conclusion(s): As expected, patients treated for tandem occlusions receiving carotid artery stenting and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy have a massive increase of radiation exposure and fluoroscopy time compared to patients treated for intracranial large vessel occlusion only. This circumstance should be considered, when dose reference levels are compared."

Fifty-five subjects (27 male and 28 female) were divided into two groups: a group with MP switched on and a group with MP switched off. The two groups were matched according to age, gender, and IQ. This double blind study lasted for 45 days and was divided in three periods: baseline (BLP, 2 days), exposure (EP, 27 days), and recovery (RP, 13 days). Subjects were exposed during EP and sham exposed during RP for 2 h/day, 5 days/week. The neuropsychological test battery composed of 22 tasks screened four neuropsychological categories: information processing, attention capacity, memory function, and executive function. This neuropsychological battery was performed four times on day 2 (BLP), day 15 (EP), day 29 (EP), and day 43 (RP). Our results indicate that daily MP use has no effect on cognitive function after a 13-h rest period. Â© 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
1470,Excluded,"Radiotherapy of painful vertebral hemangiomas: the single center retrospective analysis of 137 cases PURPOSE: An evaluation of dose-response relationship and an attempt to define predictive factors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 137 cases of painful vertebral hemangioma irradiations (101 patients). Fraction dose (fd) varied from 2 to 15 Gy (123 fractionated and 14 radiosurgical treatments), and total dose (TD) from 8 to 30 Gy (111 cases irradiated with fd of 2 GY to TD of 24 Gy). We evaluated pain relief, changes in analgesic requirements, and reossification.RESULTS: Means of pain relief 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after radiotherapy (defined as a decrease of primary pain level expressed in percent) were 60.5%, 65.4%, 68.3%, and 78.4%, respectively. Proportion of patients with no need for analgesics and patients using tramadol were 39%, 40%, 44%, 57%, and 20%, 17%, 22%, and 11% in these times. The proportion of patients experiencing complete/partial pain relief changed from 36/48% 1 month, to 64/22% 1.5 years after radiotherapy. No impact of radiotherapy on reossification was found. The positive impact of fd and TD increase for analgesics uptake reduction and pain relief was found. An increase of the fd by 1 Gy results in 27% chance of analgesics uptake reduction and 3.8% reduction of pain, whereas 14% analgesics uptake reduction and 2.2% of pain reduction in case of the TD. The predictive factors improving results were found: female gender, older age, better performance states (the chance of the lower analgesic treatment decreases over 2.5 times in comparison to the higher Zubrod degree), bigger Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data support the efficacy of radiotherapy in improving pain secondary to vertebral hemangioma, with the degree of pain amelioration being related to increasing fd and TD. The positive predictive factors were defined: female gender, older age, better performance status, increased Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration, and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy."

Using realistic reduced-dose simulation, low-dose VPCT datasets with 144 mAs, 108 mAs, 72 mAs and 36 mAs (80 %, 60 %, 40 % and 20 % of the original levels) were generated, resulting in a total of 100 datasets. Perfusion maps were created and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) measurements were performed. Qualitative analyses were conducted by two blinded readers, who also assessed the presence/absence of ischemic lesions and scored CBV and CBF maps using a modified ASPECTS-score.RESULTS: SNR of all low-dose datasets were significantly lower than those of the original datasets (p < .05). All datasets down to 72 mAs (40 %) yielded sufficient image quality and high sensitivity with excellent inter-observer-agreements, whereas 36 mAs datasets (20 %) yielded poor image quality in 15 % of the cases with lower sensitivity and inter-observer-agreements.CONCLUSION: Low-dose VPCT using decreased tube currents down to 72 mAs (40 % of original radiation dose) produces sufficient perfusion maps for the detection of ischemic brain lesions.KEY POINTS: * Perfusion CT is highly accurate for the detection of ischemic brain lesions * Perfusion CT results in high radiation exposure, therefore low-dose protocols are required * Reduction of tube current down to 72 mAs produces sufficient perfusion maps."
1251,Excluded,"The efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy for metastases from renal cell carcinoma Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for intracranial and extracranial metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma. The retrospective analysis of 85 patients (151 tumors) treated with SRT was performed. SRT was the sole treatment in 35% of tumors, the other 65% had received additional treatment such as surgery, palliative radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy. In 60% and 40% of patients SRT was delivered to brain and extracranial lesions, respectively. The assessment of the efficacy of SRT was based on a radiological imaging (Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and estimation of Local Control (LC) as well as Overall Survival (OS). Single fraction was used for 104 tumors and fractionated treatment for 47 tumors. The crude LC for evaluable lesions was 81%, stratified by tumor location: brain LC=94%, extracranial tumors LC=70% (p=0.049). The median OS was 9.4 months; 1-year and 2-year OS were 40% and 29%, respectively. The additional treatment did not lead to a better local response (p=0,543), but resulted in a benefit in OS (7 vs 13 months, p=0,01). A positive relationship between the biologically effective dose (BED) and local response was noted, but the BED was influenced by a tumor volume (R=-0,38; p<0,00001). The presence of multi-organ metastases reduced the OS rate (8.7 vs 19.1 months; p=0,01). The interval between the diagnosis of the metastasis and its treatment with SRT was inversely related to OS (P=0.0001). SRT results in a good local response, which is more beneficial for brain than extracranial lesions. The local efficacy of the SRT depends on the radiation dose. Multidisciplinary treatment and earlier application of SRT improves the prognosis of patients. Copyright Â© 2016, Cancer Research Institute Slovak Acad. of Sciences. All rights reserved."
1002,Excluded,"Radiation retinopathy is treatable with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor bevacizumab (Avastin) PURPOSE: To report on bevacizumab treatment for radiation retinopathy affecting the macula.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with radiation retinopathy (edema, hemorrhages, capillary dropout, and neovascularization) and a subjective or objective loss of vision were treated. Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) every 6-12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography.RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema. Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18). Three patients discontinued therapy. Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2). Three patients (14%) regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity. No ocular or systemic bevacizumab-related side effects were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to treat radiation retinopathy. In most cases treatment was associated with decreased vascular leakage, stabilization, or improved vision.

However, little is known about the cellular properties of DMH neurons. We employed whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques to characterize membrane properties and spontaneous post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in DMH neurons, including those projecting to PVN (identified by prior injection of DiI into PVN), in rat hypothalamic slices. DMH neurons (n=86 total) had uniform membrane properties. However, PVN-projecting neurons (n=32) had higher action potential (AP) thresholds, and fired fewer APs in response to current injection. Spontaneous PVN-projecting neurons (n=20) also fired APs at lower rates (4.8+/-0.6 Hz) than spontaneous neurons of unknown projection (n=38; 7.3+/-1.1 Hz). Spontaneous PSCs were observed in all neurons: One population expressed rapid decay characteristics (1.5-2.0 ms) and was blocked by non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX or CNQX. Remaining PSCs reversed near E(Cl), were blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists picrotoxin or bicuculline methiodide (BMI), and had longer decay time constants (4.5-6.0 ms) that were modulated by pentobarbital. Tetrodotoxin markedly reduced the frequency of PSCs sensitive to NBQX but not to BMI. Thus, DMH is made up of electrophysiologically similar neurons and PVN-projecting neurons are less excitable than neurons of unknown projection. Furthermore, as suggested by studies in intact rats, neurons in the DMH, including those projecting to the PVN, are regulated by tonic GABA(A) and non-NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission."
564,Excluded,"Treatment of posterior pelvic ring disruptions using a minimally invasive adjustable plate OBJECTIVE: Iliosacral (IS) screw fixation and posterior tension band plate (TBP) technique are two treatment alternatives for posterior pelvic ring injuries. However, IS screw fixation requires continuous fluoroscopic guidance for appropriate screw insertion and carries a risk of neurovascular injuries. TBP technique also has some disadvantages, including limited reduction potential, difficulty in precontouring the plate and a higher rate of symptomatic implants. To address these limitations, we introduced a minimally invasive adjustable plate (MIAP). This study aims to present the preliminary radiological and clinical results of posterior pelvic ring disruptions treated with MIAP.METHODS: The MIAP conforms to the irregular shape of posterior pelvic ring and can be used without prebending. This plate has a role in reducing compressed or separated fractures/dislocations. Sixteen patients, including seven males and nine females, were treated with MIAP through a minimally invasive approach. The fracture patterns consisted of six Type B and ten Type C fractures according to OTA classification of fracture. Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. Postoperative rehabilitation programme was individualised and early exercise was encouraged. Patients were followed up and the functional outcome was evaluated based upon the scoring system proposed by Lindahl and associates.RESULTS: All posterior pelvic ring disruptions were reduced and fixed with MIAP. The average duration of surgery was 49 min, the average radiation exposure was 6s, and the average blood loss was 80 mL for the treatment of posterior pelvic ring injuries. Overall radiological results of the reduction were excellent in eleven patients and good in five. The patients were followed up for 30 months on average. All fractures healed. The functional outcome was excellent in ten patients, good in four and fair in two. There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries, implant failures, irritative symptoms or pressure sores due to subcutaneous implantation.CONCLUSION: Favourable clinical and radiological outcomes can be achieved in treating posterior pelvic disruptions with MIAP. This plate is effective in view of its simplicity, less radiation exposure, safety, minimal invasion and stable fixation."

Astronauts experience altered iron homeostasis due to adaptations to microgravity and an iron-rich food system. Iron intake reaches three to six times the recommended daily allowance due to the use of fortified foods on the International Space Station. Iron is associated with certain optic neuropathies and can potentiate oxidative stress. This study examined the response of eye and vascular tissue to gamma radiation exposure (3 Gy fractionated at 37.5 cGy per day every other day for 8 fractions) in rats fed an adequate-iron diet or a high-iron diet. Twelve-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: adequate-iron diet/no radiation (CON), high-iron diet/no radiation (IRON), adequate-iron diet/radiation (RAD), and high-iron diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals were maintained on the corresponding iron diet for 2 weeks before radiation exposure. As previously published, the high-iron diet resulted in elevated blood and liver iron levels. Dietary iron overload altered the radiation response observed in serum analytes, as evidenced by a significant increase in catalase levels and smaller decrease in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity levels. 8-OHdG immunostaining, showed increased intensity in the retina after radiation exposure. Gene expression profiles of retinal and aortic vascular samples suggested an interaction between the response to radiation and high dietary iron. This study suggests that the combination of gamma radiation and high dietary iron has deleterious effects on retinal and vascular health and physiology."

Previous studies have shown that neuropathic pain, associated with significantly higher levels of mood disturbance, is present in over onequarter of older adults with chronic symptomatic radiographic knee OA. The study aims were to determine the prevalence and predictors of neuropathic pain using the painDetect questionnaire (PDQ) in a UK community-based cohort of women with knee pain. Method(s): Participants were selected from an established longitudinal population-based cohort, of 1003 women aged 43-65 years from a single general practice in the UK recruited in 1988-9. Those attending the year 20 follow-up visit with self-reported knee pain in the preceding month were included in this study. Participants self-completed the PDQ for each symptomatic knee reported. The PDQ assesses pain quality, pattern and radiation of pain resulting in a composite score (range -1 to 38) and, in patients with low back pain, the thresholds are 13-18 for possible neuropathic pain and >19 for likely neuropathic pain with 85% sensitivity, 80% specificity and 83% positive predictive value. Participants also completed: the hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS); the average knee pain severity over the preceding month was documented using a numeric rating scale of 0-10; pain in six other joints (shoulders, hips and hands); use of analgesia (paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids) and neuropathic medications (antidepressants and anticonvulsants). Age, height and weight were recorded and fully extended radiographs of the knees taken within 5 years were graded for structural features of OA using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scoring system, with radiographic OA (ROA) defined as KL > 2. PDQ scores were log transformed and we used linear regression, with GEE to account for clustering of knees from the same participant, to identify factors associated with neuropathic pain adjusting for age, BMI and analgesia and neuropathic medication use. Result(s): Of 565 participants attending the year 20 follow-up visit, 146 participants reported knee pain in the preceding month, of which 42 complained of bilateral knee pain corresponding to a total of 188 (Table presented) symptomatic knees. Included participants had a higher BMI and number of other painful joints, were less likely to have ROA and more likely to use analgesia, compared to those without knee pain. HADS did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Only 10/188 (5.3%) and 2/188 (1.1%) knees fulfilled the standard criteria for possible and likely neuropathic pain respectively (Figure). However, few knees were painful without any neuropathic features 8/188 (4.3%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that both HADS and pain severity, but not ROA or number of painful joints, were significantly positively associated with PDQ score. These associations persisted inmultivariate analysiswhen adjusted for age, BMI and medication use. For each unit increase in HADS and pain severity, PDQ increased by 4% (1%-8%) and 10% (5%-15%) respectively (Table 1). Conclusion(s): Of those with self-reported knee pain from a communitybased cohort, few fulfilled the criteria for possible and likely neuropathic pain using the standard PDQ thresholds. However, neuropathic features were more common with both increasing severity of knee pain and also measures of anxiety and depression. Evaluation for features of neuropathic pain as well as mood should be considered in patients with knee pain and may represent an important therapeutic target. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the causal sequence. (Figure presented)."

1932,Excluded,"Integration of the heart rhythmogenesis levels: heart rhythm generator in the brain We propose that along with the intracardiac pacemaker, a generator of cardiac rhythm exists in the central nervous system--in the efferent structures of the cardiovascular center of the medullar oblongata. Signals in the medulla oblongata arise as a result of the hierarchic interaction of the brain structures. Neural signals originating there in the form of bursts of impulses conduct to the heart along the vagus nerves and after interaction with cardiac pacemaker structures, cause generation of the cardiac pulse in exact accordance with the frequency of ""neural bursts"". The intrinsic cardiac rhythm generator (the sinus node) is a life-sustaining factor that maintains the heart pumping function when the central nervous system is in a stage of deep inhibition, (e.g., under anesthesia or during unconsciousness). The brain generator is the factor that provides heart adaptive reactions in behaving organism. The integration of the two levels of rhythmogenesis in the brain and heart provides reliability and functional perfection of the cardiac rhythm generation system in the whole organism."

The changes in the influence of the dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and L-DOPA, applied independently and in combination, on the dopamine level in brain and striatum, are established comparatively (in non-irradiated rats and in rats on the 72nd hour after irradiation with 900 R). Apomorphine is found to have no significant influence on the dopamine level in brain and striatum of non-irradiated rats, while L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine raise this level. On the 72nd hour after irradiation with 900 R there is no essential change in the dopamine level in brain and the striatum; apomorphine raises the dopamine level in brain and striatum; the effect of L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine is potentiated with respect to the increase of the dopamine level in brain and striatum."

We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at TGFbeta1 were associated with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Method(s):We genotyped TGFbeta1 SNPs at rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800471 (G915C), and rs1982073 (T+29C) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in blood samples from 205 NSCLC patients who had had definitive radiotherapy at one institution in November 1998-January 2005. We also tested whether the TGF-beta1 rs1982073 (T+29C) SNP affected the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. Result(s):Median follow-up time for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-97 months; 39 months for patients alive at the time of analysis). Multivariate analysis showed that the TGFbeta1 rs1800469 CT/CC genotype was associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.463 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.012-2.114], P = 0.043) and shorter DMFS (HR = 1.601 [95% CI = 1.042-2.459], P = 0.032) and that the TGFbeta1 rs1982073 CT/CC genotype predicted poor DMFS (HR = 1.589 [95% CI = 1.009-2.502], P = 0.046) and poor brain MFS (HR = 2.567 [95% CI = 1.155-5.702], P = 0.021) after adjustment for age, sex, race, performance status, smoking status, tumor histology and volume, stage, receipt of concurrent radiochemotherapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, and radiation dose. Transfection with TGFbeta1+29C (vs. +29T) stimulated the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 cells, suggesting that TGFbeta1+29C may be linked with increased metastatic potential. Conclusion(s):TGFbeta1 genotypes at rs1800469 and rs1982073 could be useful for predicting DMFS among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiation therapy. These findings require validation in larger prospective trials and thorough mechanistic studies. Â© 2013 Yuan et al."
1581,Excluded,"Role of immediate-release morphine (MIR) in the treatment of predictable pain in radiotherapy Radiotherapy is crucial in the management of cancer patients in both the curative and palliative settings. However, patients often report pain both during positioning for, and execution of, radiotherapy and this may be a reason for interrupting the radiotherapy session. This observation is common even if the patient is undergoing baseline drug therapy for cancer pain. Recent data suggest that orally administrated immediate-release morphine (MIR) is able to reduce pain in patients with predictable pain. The authors tested a rescue dose of MIR 10 or 20 mg, 20 to 60 minutes before radiotherapy, to verify the effectiveness of MIR in this setting and also to assess the patient's ability to receive the full course of radiotherapy. One hundred forty consecutive patients were evaluated during radiotherapy treatment and visual analogue scale (VAS) and positioning VAS scores were assessed. All patients completed the course of scheduled radiotherapy and pain was well controlled, despite the fact that previous pharmacological treatment had not been able to completely control chronic cancer pain. These data strongly suggest a role for MIR pretreatment in patients with pain due to positioning during radiotherapy."
891,Excluded,"Fra-1 mediated regulation of CD44 expression in malignant brain tumor cells Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of primary brain tumors. It is a highly aggressive tumor, characterized by an increased proliferation rate and a high capacity to invade surrounding tissues. Currently, GBM treatment includes surgical resection followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy. However, these therapeutic options often do not alter the infiltrative and migratory capacity of GBMs. The invasive migration of glioblastoma multiforme has been associated with CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein and the principle receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA). The molecular basis of CD44 regulation regulated in GBM is not fully understood. However, CD44 regulation has been shown to be by an AP-1 transcription factor family member, fos-related antigen (Fra-1) in an equally aggressive cancer, mesothelioma. To better understand how Fra-1 regulates cell adhesion and migration, we performed adhesion and wound healing assays on human GBM cell lines. To determine whether malignant brain tumor cell adhesion is mediated by Fra-1 expression, we analyzed GBM cell adhesion to HA. U-1242 MG cells were transfected with siRNA directed against Fra-1 and treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/ml). Adherence to HA increases in U-1242 MG cell lines following growth factor simulation, but was inhibited when the cells were transfected with Fra-1 siRNA. Using another GBM cell line A-172, and its clones, A-172 MW6 (Fra-1 dominant negative) and A-172 MW12 (Fra-1 overexpressors) we examined the migratory capacity of these cells. A-172 MW6 cells exhibit a slower migration rate than cells with higher levels of Fra-1 expression. Collectively, our results suggest that Fra-1 regulates CD44 expression in human GBM cells, which in turn affects GBM cell adhesion and migration."

2217,Excluded,"Fractionated ionizing radiation accelerates loss of amplified MDR1 genes harbored by extrachromosomal DNA in tumor cells In tumor specimens such as those from neuroblastoma, ovarian, and lung carcinoma patients, the prevalence of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules harboring amplified genes has been well established. In some cases, the amplified genes have been identified as oncogenes, and their increased expression appears to contribute to the maintenance and progression of the malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fractionated radiation treatment, given in daily doses similar to those administered clinically, on the stability of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules in cancer cells. Our studies were conducted with multidrug-resistant KB cells, which harbor extrachromosomal copies of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) almost exclusively on circular DNA molecules of approximately 750 and 1500 kb pairs. This size range is representative of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules that have been shown to harbor amplified oncogenes in vivo. Exponentially growing MDR KB cells were exposed to 1400 and 2800 cGy ionizing radiation administered in 7 and 14 fractions, respectively, at 200 cGy per fraction/day. A statistically significant decrease in MDR1 extrachromosomal gene copy number was reproducibly detected in the irradiated cells compared with unirradiated cells passaged for the duration of the experiment in the absence of radiation treatment. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in multidrug resistance and in P-glycoprotein levels, as determined by clonogenic dose-response assays and Western analyses, respectively. P-glycoprotein is a multidrug transporter encoded by the MDR1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies further determined that extrachromosomal circular DNA loss correlated to the entrapment of these DNA molecules in radiation-induced micronuclei. These results indicate that radiation-induced loss of extrachromosomally amplified genes from tumor cells via their entrapment in micronuclei contributes to the improved therapeutic response observed for some cancers."
1086,Excluded,"Statistical properties of cerebral CT perfusion imaging systems. Part I. Cerebral blood volume maps generated from nondeconvolution-based systems Purpose: The development and clinical employment of a computed tomography (CT) imaging system benefit from a thorough understanding of the statistical properties of the output images; cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) imaging system is no exception. A series of articles will present statistical properties of CTP systems and the dependence of these properties on system parameters. This Part I paper focuses on the signal and noise properties of cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps calculated using a nondeconvolution-based method. Method(s): The CBV imaging chain was decomposed into a cascade of subimaging stages, which facilitated the derivation of analytical models for the probability density function, mean value, and noise variance of CBV. These models directly take CTP source image acquisition, reconstruction, and postprocessing parameters as inputs. Both numerical simulations and in vivo canine experiments were performed to validate these models. Result(s): The noise variance of CBV is linearly related to the noise variance of source images and is strongly influenced by the noise variance of the baseline images. Uniformly partitioning the total radiation dose budget across all time frames was found to be suboptimal, and an optimal dose partition method was derived to minimize CBV noise. Results of the numerical simulation and animal studies validated the derived statistical properties of CBV. Conclusion(s): The statistical properties of CBV imaging systems can be accurately modeled by extending the linear CT systems theory. Based on the statistical model, several key signal and noise characteristics of CBV were identified and an optimal dose partition method was developed to improve the image quality of CBV.

Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) on the viability of human and animal tumor cells cultured in the presence of boron-10 isotope.Material and Methods: Human U251 and T98G glioma cells and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells were incubated at various concentrations in the culture medium containing 10B-enriched L-boronophenylalanine. The cells were irradiated with a neuron beam using the accelerator-based epithermal neuron source. A clonogenic assay was used to evaluate the viability of the irradiated cells. The absorbed doses obtained from elastic scattering of fast neutrons by substance nuclei and the doses obtained from boron neutron capture were calculated using the NMS code. The absorbed doses of gamma-radiation were measured with a mixed radiation dosimeter.Results: The viability of boron-containing and intact human U251 and T98G cell lines and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells was analyzed after neutron beam radiation. Irradiation of all four cell lines were cultured in the presence of 10B was shown to reduce their colony-forming capacity compared with the control. Elevated boron levels in the culture medium resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of survived cells. Radiation had the most pronounced impact on the proliferative capacity of the human U251 glioma cell lines.Conclusion: The cultures of human tumor cells and mammalian cells demonstrated that the neutron beam formed with the accelerator-based epithermal neutron source designed at the INP, was effective in reducing the viability of tumor cells in the presence of 10B."
327,Excluded,"[Rotational digital subtraction angiography of carotid bifurcation stenosis] PURPOSE: A prospective study was designed to evaluate, whether multiplanar imaging with rotational digital subtraction angiography (R-DSA) could improve assessment of carotid artery bifurcation stenosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients with suspected stenosis of the ICA were examined with DSA in standard projections (0 degree-(45 degrees)-90 degrees) and additional R-DSA of each ICA from 0-90 degrees in 10 degrees steps. We compared imaging quality and degree of stenosis as well as exposure of the patients to radiation and contrast media.RESULTS: 79/82 R-DSA (96%) were suitable for evaluation of stenosis, 58/82 (70%) matched the quality standard of single projection DSA. Specificity and sensitivity of the R-DSA to diagnose high grade ACI stenosis were 100% and 94%, respectively. 7/79 R-DSA revealed a higher and 3/79 a lower degree of stenosis than the corresponding DSA. Regarding the degree of stenosis there was no significant difference between the two modalities (p > 0.05), but R-DSA detected 4 stenoses greater than 60% that were estimated to be lower than 60% by DSA. Radiation dose for R-DSA was equivalent to one DSA run (170 cGycm2). The average amount of contrast media (25 ml) was slightly higher than for 2-3 single-projection DSA (19.8 ml).CONCLUSIONS: R-DSA provides high quality imaging of the carotid bifurcation with multiplanar projections facilitating exact grading of vessel stenosis. The number of cases (n = 2) is to small to judge the value of R-DSA as to (tandem-) stenosis of the distal ICA. Still, diagnostic value and low radiation exposure justify the use of R-DSA as additional series to standard protocols."
1863,Included,"The Impact of body-only proton radiation on immune-CNS communication Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an established treatment for many hematological disorders including lymphomas and leukemias. Although the prognosis after HSCT has historically been poor, associated with high mortality rates, advances in treatment have led to increases in long-term survival and, consequently, an increased risk for neuropsychological dysfunction. Roughly 40% of all allogeneic HSCTs performed in 2006-2010 involved total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning. Previously, we reported that many TBI-induced changes in splenic phagocytic populations were mitigated by chlorisondamine (CHL), a non-selective nicotinic blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we characterized the effects of body-only proton irradiation (excluding brain) and CHL on the response to a bacterial challenge in 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were given CHL (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and irradiated (0 or 3 Gy) 60-90 min later. Ten days post-irradiation, mice were inoculated with 5e7 CFU of Escherichia coli (i.p.) and euthanized 90-120 min later. We characterized blood and splenic leukocyte population distributions (flow cytometry and hematology), cytokine levels (multiplexed cytokine analysis) and oxidative burst capacity. Radiation decreased virtually all splenic leukocyte counts while increasing oxidative burst capacity. In the blood, radiation decreased lymphocytes but increased innate subsets. Sympathetic blockade did not counter most of these radiation effects. This suggests that the disruptive effect of TBI on brain-immune communication is dependent on direct exposure to the brain."

However, currently there is no universally recognized dose quantity that can be used to assess and report generalised risks to individuals following whole body exposures in the high-dose range. In this work, a number of potential dose quantities are presented and discussed, with mathematical modelling techniques employed to compare them and explore when their differences are most or least manifest. The results are interpreted to propose the average (D <sub>GRB</sub>) of the absorbed doses to the stomach, small intestine, red bone marrow, and brain as the optimum quantity for informing assessments of risk. A second, maximally conservative dose quantity (D <sub>Max</sub>) is also suggested, which places limits on any under-estimates resulting from the adoption of D <sub>GRB</sub>. The primary aim of this work is to spark debate, with further work required to refine the final choice of quantity or quantities most appropriate for the full range of different potential exposure scenarios."

Five healthy volunteers underwent whole-body combined PET-computed tomography 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after tracer injection (mean dose, 9.5 mCi +/- 3.4 [standard deviation] [351.5 MBq +/- 125.8]; mean specific radioactivity, 1200 mCi/mmol +/- 714 [44.4 GBq/mmol +/- 26.4]). During this time, standard vital signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) readings, and blood sample values (for chemistry, hematologic, and liver function tests) were checked at regular intervals and 1 and 7 days after the injection. These data were used to evaluate tracer biodistribution and dosimetric properties, time-activity curves, and the stability of laboratory values. Significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values were evaluated by using a combination of population-averaged generalized estimating equation regression and exact paired Wilcoxon tests.RESULTS: The administration of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was well tolerated, with no marked effects on vital signs, ECG readings, or laboratory values. The tracer showed the same pattern of biodistribution in all volunteers: primary clearance through the kidneys (0.360 rem/mCi +/- 0.185 [0.098 mSv/MBq +/- 0.050]) and bladder (0.862 rem/mCi +/- 0.436 [0.233 mSv/MBq +/- 0.118], voiding model) and uptake in the spleen (0.250 rem/mCi +/- 0.168 [0.068 mSv/MBq +/- 0.046]) and large intestine (0.529 rem/mCi +/- 0.236 [0.143 mSv/MBq +/- 0.064]). The mean effective dose of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was 0.1462 rem/mCi +/- 0.0669 (0.0396 mSv/MBq +/- 0.0181). With an injected dose of 10 mCi (370 MBq) and a 1-hour voiding interval, a patient would be exposed to an effective radiation dose of 1.5 rem (15 mSv). Above the diaphragm, there was minimal uptake in the brain ventricles, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. Time-activity curves showed rapid clearance from the vasculature, with a mean 26% +/- 17 of the tracer remaining in the circulation at 30 minutes and most of the activity occurring in the plasma relative to cells (mean whole blood-plasma ratio, 0.799 +/- 0.096).CONCLUSION: (18)F-FPPRGD2 has desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties. The primary application is likely to be PET evaluation of oncologic patients-especially those with brain, breast, or lung cancer. Specific indications may include tumor staging, identifying patients who would benefit from antiangiogenesis therapy, and separating treatment responders from nonresponders early."
2928,Excluded,"A comparison of two systems of patient immobilization for prostate radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Reproducibility of different immobilization systems, which may affect set-up errors, remains uncertain. Immobilization systems and their corresponding set-up errors influence the clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-PTV) margins and thus may result in undesirable treatment outcomes. This study compared the reproducibility of patient positioning with Hipfix system and whole body alpha cradle with respect to localized prostate cancer and investigated the existing CTV-PTV margins in the clinical oncology departments of two hospitals.METHODS: Forty sets of data of patients with localized T1-T3 prostate cancer were randomly selected from two regional hospitals, with 20 patients immobilized by a whole-body alpha cradle system and 20 by a thermoplastic Hipfix system. Seven sets of the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC) and medial-lateral (ML) deviations were collected from each patient. The reproducibility of patient positioning within the two hospitals was compared using a total vector error (TVE) parameter. In addition, CTV-PTV margins were computed using van Herk's formula. The resulting values were compared to the current CTV-PTV margins in both hospitals.RESULTS: The TVE values were 5.1 and 2.8 mm for the Hipfix and the whole-body alpha cradle systems respectively. TVE associated with the whole-body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly less than the Hipfix system (p < 0.05). The CC axis in the Hipfix system attained the highest frequency of large (23.6%) and serious (7.9%) set-up errors. The calculated CTV to PTV margin was 8.3, 1.9 and 2.3 mm for the Hipfix system, and 2.1, 3.4 and 1.8 mm for the whole body alpha cradle in CC, ML and AP axes respectively. All but one (CC axis using Hipfix) margin calculated did not exceed the corresponding hospital protocol. The whole body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly better than the Hipfix system in terms of reproducibility (p < 0.05), especially in the CC axis.CONCLUSIONS: The whole body alpha cradle system was more reproducible than the Hipfix system. In particular, the difference in CC axis contributed most to the results and the current CC margin for the Hipfix system might be considered as inadequate."

15,Excluded,"Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma: the next step PURPOSE: The use of preradiotherapy (RT) methotrexate (MTX) has improved disease control and survival in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). The reported protocol was designed to optimize and enhance the chemotherapeutic component of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated with five cycles of high-dose MTX 3.5 g/m(2), procarbazine 100 mg/m(2)/d, and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2). Thirty patients received whole-brain RT (45 Gy). Twenty-two older patients deferred RT to diminish the risk of delayed neurotoxicity; these patients are compared with 12 older patients who completed the entire treatment regimen. Most patients (n = 35) received high-dose cytarabine after RT.RESULTS: Objective response rate to the induction chemotherapy regimen was 90%; overall median survival is 60 months. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was seen in 30 patients, primarily in association with cytarabine; grade 3 nephrotoxicity due to MTX was seen in two patients. Older patients had similar median survival with or without the addition of RT: 32 versus 33 months, respectively. However, late neurotoxicity was significantly more common in those older patients who received RT (P: =.00004). Patients younger than 60 years who received the complete treatment regimen have not reached median disease-free or overall survival.CONCLUSION: Increasing the dose of MTX and adding procarbazine and vincristine improved disease control and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL. Younger patients in particular fared extremely well with this treatment regimen. In older patients, deferring whole-brain RT did not compromise overall survival but did reduce treatment-related toxicity."

The dysregulation of normal S-nitrosylation contributes to degenerative conditions and to cancer. To gain insight into the biochemical changes induced by low-dose ionizing radiation, we determined global S-nitrosylation by the ""biotin switch"" assay coupled with mass spectrometry analyses in organs of C57BL/6J mice exposed to acute 0.1 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma-rays. The dose of radiation was delivered to the whole body in the presence or absence of iopamidol, an iodinated contrast agent used during radiological examinations. To investigate whether similar or distinct nitrosylation patterns are induced following high-dose irradiation, mice were exposed in parallel to acute 4 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma rays. Analysis of modulated S-nitrosothiols (SNO-proteins) in freshly-harvested organs of animals sacrificed 13 days after irradiation revealed radiation dose- and contrast agent-dependent changes. The major results were as follows: (i) iopamidol alone had significant effects on S-nitrosylation in brain, lung and liver; (ii) relative to the control, exposure to 0.1 Gy without iopamidol resulted in statistically-significant SNO changes in proteins that differ in molecular weight in liver, lung, brain and blood plasma; (iii) iopamidol enhanced the decrease in S-nitrosylation induced by 0.1 Gy in brain; (iv) whereas a decrease in S-nitrosylation occurred at 0.1 Gy for proteins of ~50 kDa in brain and for proteins of ~37 kDa in liver, an increase was detected at 4 Gy in both organs; (v) mass spectrometry analyses of nitrosylated proteins in brain revealed differential modulation of SNO proteins (e.g., sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1; beta tubulins; ADP-ribosylation factor 5) by low- and high-dose irradiation; and (vi) ingenuity pathway analysis identified major signaling networks to be modulated, in particular the neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway was differentially modulated by low- and high-dose gamma-irradiation."

There is controversy, however, over the identity of the diffusible substance; two alternative schemes have received widespread support (for review see refs 1,2). According to the 'calcium hypothesis', light stimulates the release into the cytoplasm of calcium, leading to the blockage of channels which are normally open in darkness, whereas based on the 'cyclic nucleotide hypothesis', cyclic GMP causes the opening of channels in the dark, but is hydrolysed by a light-activated phosphodiesterase. We report here effects of introducing calcium buffers and cyclic GMP into the rod cytoplasm by means of a patch pipette, which seem to be inconsistent with the calcium hypothesis."
1020,Excluded,"Histopathological Findings After Reirradiation Compared to First Irradiation of Spinal Bone Metastases With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: A Cohort Study BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of the spine provides superior tumor control, but vertebral compression fractures are increased and the pathophysiological process underneath is not well understood. Data on histopathological changes, particularly after salvage SBRT (sSBRT) following conventional irradiation, are scarce.OBJECTIVE: To investigate surgical specimens after sSBRT and primary SBRT (pSBRT) regarding histopathological changes.METHODS: We assessed 704 patients treated with spine SBRT 2006 to 2012. Thirty patients underwent salvage surgery; 23 histopathological reports were available. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed for sSBRT (69.6%) and pSBRT (30.4%).RESULTS: Mean time to surgery after sSBRT/pSBRT was 8.3/10.3 mo (P = .64). Reason for surgery included pain (sSBRT/pSBRT: 12.5%/71.4%, P = .25), fractures (sSBRT/pSBRT: 37.5%/28.6%, P = .68), and neurological symptoms (sSBRT/pSBRT: 68.8%/42.9%, P = .24). Radiological tumor progression after sSBRT/pSBRT was seen in 71.4%/42.9% (P = .2). Most specimens displayed viable/proliferative tumor (sSBRT/pSBRT: 62.5%/71.4%, P = .68 and 56.3%/57.1%, P = .97). Few specimens showed soft tissue necrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 20%/28.6%, P = .66), osteonecrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 14.3%/16.7%, P = .89), or bone marrow fibrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 42.9%/33.3%, P = .69). Tumor bed necrosis was more common after sSBRT (81.3%/42.9%, P = .066). Radiological tumor progression correlated with viable/proliferative tumor (P = .03/P = .006) and tumor bed necrosis (P = .03). Fractures were increased with bone marrow fibrosis (P = .07), but not with osteonecrosis (P = .53) or soft tissue necrosis (P = .19). Neurological symptoms were common with radiological tumor progression (P = .07), but not with fractures (P = .18).CONCLUSION: For both, sSBRT and pSBRT, histopathological changes were similar. Neurological symptoms were attributable to tumor progression and pathological fractures were not associated with osteonecrosis or tumor progression."
1386,Excluded,"Altered cellular morphology and microfilament array in ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts Cells derived from individuals with the ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome demonstrate a number of unusual properties. They are highly sensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation and also fail to demonstrate the normal inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with this type of DNA-damaging agent. Additionally, a number of ataxia-telangiectasia lymphoblastoid lines have been shown to have an unusual regulation of the cellular actin levels. However, the primary lesion causing ataxia-telangiectasia is unknown. In this paper we report an altered cellular morphology in three ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblast lines, but not in a number of control fibroblast lines. Investigation of the cytoskeleton using antibodies against certain cytoskeletal proteins revealed a difference in the microfilament pattern from ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts compared to controls. Ataxia fibroblasts showed a microfilament stress fiber pattern that appeared to have a more well defined and abundant array of stress fibers than control fibroblasts. In contrast, no differences were observed in the microtubule array, nor in the vinculin patterns between any of the cell lines. In addition to the differences in the microfilament patterns, ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts differed in their ability to recover from microfilament disruption by dimethyl sulfoxide. Control fibroblasts returned to a normal cellular state in a shorter time compared to ataxia fibroblasts, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence using antiactin. These results provide further evidence for a cytoskeletal anomaly in ataxia-telangiectasia."

The rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The control group did not receive melatonin or irradiation but received both 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally and sham irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The melatonin plus IR group received irradiation to the total cranium plus 5 mg/kg/day melatonin intraperitoneally. The melatonin group received only 5 mg/kg/day melatonin plus sham-irradiation. Biochemical parameters measured in murine lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens antioxidant capacity, as measured by levels of total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activity, significantly increased in melatonin, control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the IR group. Lens glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased in control and melatonin groups when compared with the IR group. Lens malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly increased in the IR group when compared with control, melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups. Lens TSSA and NSSA activities significantly decreased in control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the melatonin group. Lens GST activity significantly increased in the control group when compared with melatonin plus IR group. Lens GRD activity significantly increased in melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with control group.CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin reduces oxidative stress markers and augments anti-oxidant capacity in the rat lens."

528,Excluded,"Brain stereotactic radiosurgery planning using the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique Purpose/Objective(s): Brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment using a single isocenter for treating multiple metastases can save treatment time but poses a challenge to SRS planning using the dynamic-arc technique. The objective of this study is to develop a strategy for SRS planning using the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique. We hypothesize that the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique can produce satisfactory SRS plans for treating multiple targets and save treatment time. Materials/Methods: We have developed a planning strategy for singleisocenter dynamic-arc technique and used it clinically since February 2015. In this technique, the targets are first split into small batches so that all targets in a batch are within 5 cm of each other. The center of gravity of all targets in a batch is the isocenter, with which multiple treatment groups are associated. Each treatment group typically consists of 3 dynamic-arc beams to irradiate 1-3 targets. For each arc, the collimator angle is adjusted to minimize the ""island"" between targets that cannot be blocked with the multileaf collimators (MLCs). Each treatment group is normalized so that the maximal dose is 125% of the prescription dose. If the maximal dose to a target is less than 123%, an additional arc is used to boost the maximal dose of that target to 125%. To evaluate the plan quality we randomly selected 5 cases planned with this technique. There were totally 21 planning target volumes (PTVs), and 13 isocenters were used to treat all these targets. We replanned them using multiple isocenters, 1 isocenter for each target. The prescription for each target was 20 Gy with a maximal dose of 25 Gy, which was equivalent to 20 Gy to 80% isodose line. Plan quality indexes including PTV coverage, mean dose, V12Gy, conformity index (CI), and V50%/VPTV were compared. Result(s): Satisfactory PTV coverage (V100%Z95% and V95%Z100%) were achieved for all plans using either technique. Most PTVs have a maximal dose between 24.9 and 25.1 Gy, with 2 PTV between 24.5 and 24.9 Gy. The ratios of mean dose and CI between the single- and multiple-isocenter techniques were respectively 1.05+/-0.035 and 1.06+/-0.0, indicating similar plan quality globally and in the high dose area. The difference was more pronounced for the mid-to-low dose spillage with the ratios of V12Gy and V50%/VPTV being 1.12+/-0.055 and 1.14+/-0.045, respectively. Overall, the plan quality was slightly better for the multi-isocenter technique because the single-isocenter technique uses MLCs instead of jaws to block the radiation between targets and thus has a higher leakage dose. The treatment time was reduced by 30%-50% with the single-isocenter technique. Conclusion(s): The single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique can produce satisfactory SRS plans for treating multiple targets and can significantly reduce the treatment time. This time saving can be further improved using a larger allowable distance between targets. However, this tactic might worsen the rotational error to an unacceptable level."
2835,Excluded,"Acute exposure to low-level light at night is sufficient to induce neurological changes and depressive-like behavior The advent and wide-spread adoption of electric lighting over the past century has profoundly affected the circadian organization of physiology and behavior for many individuals in industrialized nations; electric lighting in homes, work environments, and public areas have extended daytime activities into the evening, thus, increasing night-time exposure to light. Although initially assumed to be innocuous, chronic exposure to light at night (LAN) is now associated with increased incidence of cancer, metabolic disorders, and affective problems in humans. However, little is known about potential acute effects of LAN. To determine whether acute exposure to low-level LAN alters brain function, adult male, and female mice were housed in either light days and dark nights (LD; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 0 lux) or light days and low level light at night (LAN; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 5 lux). Mice exposed to LAN on three consecutive nights increased depressive-like responses compared to mice housed in dark nights. In addition, female mice exposed to LAN increased central tendency in the open field. LAN was associated with reduced hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in both male and female mice, as well as increased VEGFR1 and interleukin-1beta mRNA expression in females, and reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in males. Further, LAN significantly altered circadian rhythms (activity and temperature) and circadian gene expression in female and male mice, respectively. Altogether, this study demonstrates that acute exposure to LAN alters brain physiology and can be detrimental to well-being in otherwise healthy individuals."
837,Excluded,"Osteoradionecrosis of the cervical spine resulting from radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies: operative and nonoperative management. Case report Osteoradionecrosis is a process of dysvascular bone necrosis and fibrous replacement following exposure to high doses of radiation. The poorly vascularized necrotic tissue may cause pain and/or instability, and it cannot resist infection well, which may result in secondary osteomyelitis. When these processes affect the cervical spine, the resulting instability and neurological deficits can be devastating, and immediate reestablishment of spinal stability is paramount. Reconstruction of the cervical spine can be particularly challenging in this subgroup of patients in whom the spine is poorly vascularized after radical surgery, high-dose irradiation, and infection. The authors report three cases of cervical spine osteoradionecrosis following radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies. Two patients suffered secondary osteomyelitis, severe spinal deformity, and spinal cord compression. These patients underwent surgery in which a vascularized fibular graft and instrumentation were used to reconstruct the cervical spine; subsequently hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy was instituted. Fusion occurred, spinal stability was restored, and neurological dysfunction resolved at the 2- and 4-year follow-up examinations, respectively. The third patient experienced pain and dysphagia but did not have osteomyelitis, spinal instability, or neurological deficits. He underwent HBO therapy alone, with improved symptoms and imaging findings. Hyperbaric oxygen is an essential part of treatment for osteoradionecrosis and may be sufficient by itself for uncomplicated cases, but surgery is required for patients with spinal instability, spinal cord compression, and/or infection. A vascularized fibular bone graft is a very helpful adjunct in these patients because it adds little morbidity and may increase the rate of spinal fusion."
420,Excluded,"3D Variation in delineation of head and neck organs at risk Background: Consistent delineation of patient anatomy becomes increasingly important with the growing use of highly conformal and adaptive radiotherapy techniques. This study investigates the magnitude and 3D localization of interobserver variability of organs at risk (OARs) in the head and neck area with application of delineation guidelines, to establish measures to reduce current redundant variability in delineation practice. Method(s): Interobserver variability among five experienced radiation oncologists was studied in a set of 12 head and neck patient CT scans for the spinal cord, parotid and submandibular glands, thyroid cartilage, and glottic larynx. For all OARs, three endpoints were calculated: the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), the Concordance Index (CI) and a 3D measure of variation (3D SD). Result(s): All endpoints showed largest interobserver variability for the glottic larynx (ICC = 0.27, mean CI = 0.37 and 3D SD = 3.9 mm). Better agreement in delineations was observed for the other OARs (range, ICC = 0.32-0.83, mean CI = 0.64-0.71 and 3D SD = 0.9-2.6 mm). Cranial, caudal, and medial regions of the OARs showed largest variations. All endpoints provided support for improvement of delineation practice. Conclusion(s): Variation in delineation is traced to several regional causes. Measures to reduce this variation can be: (1) guideline development, (2) joint delineation review sessions and (3) application of multimodality imaging. Improvement of delineation practice is needed to standardize patient treatments."
306,Excluded,"Tumor resistance to radiotherapy is triggered by an ATM/TAK1-dependent-increased expression of the cellular prion protein In solid cancers, high expression of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is associated with stemness, invasiveness, and resistance to chemotherapy, but the role of PrPC in tumor response to radiotherapy is unknown. Here, we show that, in neuroblastoma, breast, and colorectal cancer cell lines, PrPC expression is increased after ionizing radiation (IR) and that PrPC deficiency increases radiation sensitivity and decreases radiation-induced radioresistance in tumor cells. In neuroblastoma cells, IR activates ATM that triggers TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of JNK and subsequent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor that ultimately increases PRNP promoter transcriptional activity through an AP-1 binding site in the PRNP promoter. Importantly, we show that this ATM-TAK1-PrPC pathway mediated radioresistance is activated in all tumor cell lines studied and that pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 activity recapitulates the effects of PrPC deficiency. Altogether, these results unveil how tumor cells activate PRNP to acquire resistance to radiotherapy and might have implications for therapeutic targeting of solid tumors radioresistance."

Its potent alpha-radiation makes <sup>211</sup>At unsuitable for dose planning. Its x-rays can be used for gammacamera monitoring of the radioactivity distribution during therapy but not for accurate estimation of absorbed dose in critical organs. This study was intended to establish whether the absorbed dose delivered by astatinated antibody could be accurately determined by analogue labeling with radiohalogens, better suited for quantitative measurements in vivo. PET facilitates quantitative pharmacokinetics; possible halogen labels are, e.g., <sup>76</sup>Br (T<inf>1/2</inf> = 16.2 h) and <sup>124</sup>I (T<inf>1/2</inf> = 4.18 d).

Although the survival rate for GBM has improved with recent advancements in treatment, the prognosis remains generally poor. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of GBM patients seen in National University Hospital, Singapore, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from January 2002 to December 2011. Data on disease and treatment factors was collected and correlated with survival. RESULTS Data on a total of 107 GBM patients was analysed. Their median survival time was 15.1 months and the two-year survival rate was 23.5%, which is comparable with data published in other series. The factors associated with improved median survival time were radiotherapy dose > 50 Gy (16.1 months vs. 8.7 months, p = 0.01) and adjuvant concurrent chemotherapy (16.4 months vs. 9.2 months, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION GBM confers a poor prognosis. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy are associated with improved survival. Ethnicity may be a contributing factor to differences in GBM incidence and prognosis. Copyright Â© 2017, Singapore Medical Association. All rights reserved."
