746,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of 11C-Nicotine from Whole-Body PET Imaging in Humans This study assessed the in vivo distribution of 11C-nicotine and the absorbed radiation dose from whole-body 11C-nicotine PET imaging of 11 healthy (5 male and 6 female) subjects. Methods: After an initial CT attenuation scan, 11C-nicotine was administered via intravenous injection. A dynamic PET scan was acquired for 90 s with the brain in the field of view, followed by a series of 13 whole-body PET scans acquired over a 90-min period. Regions of interest were drawn over organs visible in the reconstructed PET images. Time-activity curves were generated, and the residence times were calculated. The absorbed radiation dose for the whole body was calculated by entering the residence time in OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software to model the equivalent organ dose and the effective dose for a 70-kg man. Results: The mean residence times for 11C-nicotine in the liver, red marrow, brain, and lungs were 0.048 +/- 0.010, 0.031 +/- 0.005, 0.021 +/- 0.004, and 0.020 +/- 0.005 h, respectively. The mean effective dose for 11C-nicotine was 5.44 +/- 0.67 muSv/MBq. The organs receiving the highest absorbed dose from the 11C-nicotine injection were the urinary bladder wall (14.68 +/- 8.70 muSv/MBq), kidneys (9.56 +/- 2.46 muSv/MBq), liver (8.94 +/- 1.67 muSv/MBq), and spleen (9.49 +/- 3.89 muSv/MBq). The renal and hepatobiliary systems were the major clearance and excretion routes for radioactivity. Conclusion: The estimated radiation dose from 11C-nicotine administration is relatively modest and would allow for multiple PET examinations on the same subject.

1201,"Safety and efficacy of applying a low-dose radiation fluoroscopy protocol in device implantations Aims For cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantations, visualization of lead placement is necessary and fluoroscopy remains by far the most commonly used technique. With simple changes in the X-ray system settings, total radiation dose can be reduced significantly. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of various CIED implantations performed after implementation of a new dose reduction protocol (DRP). Methods and results We conducted a retrospective chart review of 584 patients undergoing CIED implantation or revision in our hospital. Of these patients, 280 (48%) underwent the implantation prior to and 304 (52%) after the DRP introduction. The DRP included various changes for optimized image processing and exposure system settings to enable dose reduction, as well as a reduced frame rates (4 FPS for fluoroscopy and 7.5 FPS for cinematographic images). Of the 584 patients, 53 (9.1%) had a one-chamber pacemaker, 232 (39.7%) a two-chamber pacemaker, 133 (22.8%) a one-chamber ICD, 35 (6.0%) a two-chamber ICD, 82 (14.0%) a CRT (de novo) implantation, and 49 (8.3%) had an upgrade to a CRT device. DRP was associated with a 64% reduction of the dose-area product (1372+/-2659 vs. 3792+/-5025 cGcm2, P , 0.001), while fluoroscopy duration (13+/-15 vs. 13+/-15 min) and procedural duration (93+/-52 vs. 92+/-52 min.) did not significantly increase. Complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion The DRP proved to effectively reduce radiation dose for all types of CIED implantations. Fluoroscopy time, total procedure time, and the number of complications did not increase after introducing the DRP.Copyright © 2017 The Author. European Society of Cardiology.

801,"Impaired permeability in radiation-induced lung injury detected by technetium-99m-DTPA lung clearance UNLABELLED: This study evaluates the use of the 99mTc-DTPA aerosol lung clearance method to investigate radiation-induced lung changes in eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung or breast carcinoma. The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included
1024,"Value of dual-phase 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy with neck and thoracic SPECT/CT in secondary hyperparathyroidism OBJECTIVE. Surgical intervention in the form of parathyroidectomy is generally considered only for severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). However, correct location of the parathyroid glands before parathyroidectomy is a challenge. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT in the detection of parathyroid tissue to guide operative treatment of patients with sHPT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eighty patients with sHPT who were undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated preoperatively with dual-phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT parathyroid scintigraphy to locate parathyroid tissue before parathyroidectomy. The scintigraphic results were classified as positive or negative. The accuracy of 99mTc sestamibi early and delayed phase SPECT/CT scintigraphy was determined. RESULTS. Early phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT depicted 3.57 parathyroid glands (PTGs) and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT depicted 3.55 PTGs per study. The specificity of both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT in detecting PTGs was 100%. The 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT images of 7 of 80 patients showed positive findings in the delayed phase and negative findings in the early phase. The 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT images of 6 of 80 patients showed positive findings in the early phase and negative findings in the delayed phase. CONCLUSION. The results of our study indicate that both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT should be performed in the preoperative evaluation of hemodialysis patients with sHPT due to chronic kidney disease. Performance of both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT did not increase the radiation dose compared with the use of only the early or the delayed phase. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
146,"Hypovolemic men and women regulate blood pressure differently following exposure to artificial gravity PURPOSE: In addition to serious bone, vestibular, and muscle deterioration, space flight leads to cardiovascular dysfunction upon return to gravity. In seeking a countermeasure to space flight-induced orthostatic intolerance, we previously determined that exposure to artificial gravity (AG) training in a centrifuge improved orthostatic tolerance of ambulatory subjects. This protocol was more effective in men than women and more effective when subjects exercised., METHODS: We now determine the orthostatic tolerance limit (OTL) of cardiovascularly deconditioned (furosemide) men and women on one day following 90 min of AG compared to a control day (90 min of head-down bed rest, HDBR)., RESULTS: There were three major findings: a short bout of artificial gravity improved orthostatic tolerance of hypovolemic men (30 %) and women (22 %). Men and women demonstrated different mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation on AG and HDBR days; women maintained systolic blood pressure the same after HDBR and AG exposure while men's systolic pressure dropped (11 +/- 2.9 mmHg) after AG. Third, as presyncopal symptoms developed, men's and women's cardiac output and stroke volume dropped to the same level on both days, even though the OTL test lasted significantly longer on the AG day, indicating cardiac filling as a likely variable to trigger presyncope., CONCLUSIONS: (1) Even with gender differences, AG should be considered as a space flight countermeasure to be applied to astronauts before reentry into gravity, (2) men and women regulate blood pressure during an orthostatic stress differently following exposure to artificial gravity and (3) the trigger for presyncope may be cardiac filling.",Excluded
1076,"NORMAL TISSUE REACTIONS TO CHRONIC RADIATION EXPOSURE IN MAN This paper presents an overview of radiobiological dependences governing the occurrence of tissue (organ) reactions that determine the outcomes of chronic exposure to low-LET ionizing radiation (IR) in humans. The mechanisms involved in the development of tissue reactions (TRs) to long-term exposures to IR and radioadaptation are considered. The overview describes the reactions of the haematopoietic, immune, nervous, reproductive and endocrine systems, lungs, skin and crystalline lens to chronic radiation exposure, which are of fundamental importance in view of radiation protection. It is shown that the individual's physiological tissue (organ) reserve, and also that induced by radiation exposure at low-dose rates are of great significance in the context of TR development.

23,"Cone beam computed tomography, a low-dose imaging technique in the postoperative assessment of cochlear implantation BACKGROUND: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an extremely useful technique for dentomaxillofacial imaging because it provides clear images of highly contrasted structures. Previous studies evaluating the applicability of this technique in otologic imaging were very encouraging but were only performed in vitro on temporal bone specimens. The intracochlear positioning of the individual electrodes after cochlear implantation by means of CBCT has not yet been shown in vivo., OBJECTIVE: We describe a protocol for in vivo postoperative imaging of cochlear implants by CBCT. Moreover, the effective dose was measured and compared with the effective dose used on 4- and 16-slice multislice computed tomography (MSCT) by using a RANDO-phantom., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Developing a protocol for in vivo postoperative imaging of cochlear implants by CBCT., RESULTS: CBCT provides high-resolution and almost artifact-free multiplanar reconstruction images allowing assessment of the precise intracochlear position of the electrode and visualization of each of the individual contacts. The calculated effective dose of the used CBCT and MSCT acquisitions is 80 musv for the CBCT, 3,600 musv for the 16-slice computed tomography, and 4,800 musv for the 4-slice computed tomography., CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggests that, for in vivo postoperative evaluation of cochlear implants, CBCT can provide at least the same information as conventional radiography, digital radiograph, and MSCT but in a more comfortable and a much more safer way.",Excluded
572,"Pten regulates Aurora-A and cooperates with Fbxw7 in modulating radiation-induced tumor development The Aurora-A kinase gene is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, leading to major efforts to develop therapeutic agents targeting this pathway. Here, we show that Aurora-A is targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7 in a process that is regulated by GSK3beta. Using a series of truncated Aurora-A proteins and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified distinct FBXW7 and GSK3beta-binding sites in Aurora-A. Mutation of critical residues in either site substantially disrupts degradation of Aurora-A. Furthermore, we show that loss of Pten results in the stabilization of Aurora-A by attenuating FBXW7-dependent degradation of Aurora-A through the AKT/GSK3beta pathway. Moreover, radiation-induced tumor latency is significantly shortened in Fbxw7(+/-)Pten(+/-) mice as compared with either Fbxw7(+/-) or Pten(+/-) mice, indicating that Fbxw7 and Pten appear to cooperate in suppressing tumorigenesis. Our results establish a novel posttranslational regulatory network in which the Pten and Fbxw7 pathways appear to converge on the regulation of Aurora-A level. Copyright 2012 AACR",Excluded
862,"Postoperative radiographs after maxillofacial trauma: Sense or nonsense? The purpose of the present study was to investigate the necessity of routine postoperative radiographic analysis in patients with maxillofacial trauma. Between January 2000 and January 2010, 579 patients were treated surgically for 646 maxillofacial fractures including complex maxillofacial trauma. The incidence of surgical retreatments based on postoperative radiographs after maxillofacial trauma were investigated. 16 patients needed surgical retreatment. The decision to revise was based on postoperative imaging alone in one patient (0.2%). The available data in the literature concerning postoperative radiography in maxillofacial trauma was reviewed. Six useful studies concerning postoperative radiography in maxillofacial trauma were available for review. When combining these studies a total of 1377 patients underwent surgery for correction of a maxillofacial fracture. Nine patients returned to the operating theatre for correction of the initial procedure after trauma (0.7%). The present results are in line with the available literature. Routine postoperative radiography is not necessary after surgical treatment of maxillofacial trauma. Avoiding routine postoperative radiography will lead to a reduction in exposure of patients to ionizing radiation, a reduction of costs and probably a more efficient discharge.

510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies. Watchful monitoring, corrections to calculated dose when changes observed are significant and radiotherapy accessories modification during the course of treatment are strongly recommended.",Excluded
409,"Hemi body irradiation: An economical way of palliation of pain in bone metastasis in advanced cancer Background: The primary aim of this prospective non-randomized study was to evaluate the effect of hemi-body irradiation (HBI) on pain and quality of life in cancer patients with extensive bone metastases. The secondary aim was to evaluate side-effects and cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2008 and December 2010, a total of 23 (male = 14, female = 9, median age = 60 years) diagnosed cases of metastatic cancer patients (prostate = 11, breast = 6, and lung = 6) received HBI, which was delivered as lower (n = 7) (dose = 8 Gy), upper (n = 8) (dose = 6 Gy), or sequential HBI (n = 8) with a Telecobalt unit (Theratron 780C). Among them, one lung cancer patient died at 2 months and one prostate cancer patient defaulted after the second follow-up. Thus, 21 patients (male = 13, female = 8, median age = 65 years) (prostatic cancer = 10, breast cancer = 6, and lung cancer = 5) were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Evaluations were performed before and at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment. Pain evaluation was done by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), Percentage of Pain Relief (PRR), and Global Pain Score (GPS). Toxicity was assessed by CTC v-3 toxicity scores in the medical record. Assessment of oral morphine consumption was done before and after radiation using paired t-test, and correlation analysis was also done with decrease of morphine consumption and reduction of pain score using statistical analysis. Result(s): Response (control of pain) was partial (PR) in 67% and complete (CR) in 22% of patients. For most patients, the pain control lasted throughout the follow-up period (6 months). From 66.66% patients requiring 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day prior to HBI, none of the patients required to consume 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day following HBI, which was correlated with significant reduction in various pain scores (P < 0.05). One way ANOVA with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test (P < 0.05) was significant in VAS score changes, VRS score changes, PPR score changes, and GPS score changes. Along with the decrease in morphine tablets, the Linear Correlation of various scales for pain reduction like VAS, VRS, PPR, and GPS were significant. As such, the quality of life was better due to decreased pain and also, a decrease in the dose of analgesics. Grade 1 and 2 hematological toxicity and grade 1 diarrhea were observed as common side-effects. The average total cost of treatment including hospital stay, medicines, and radiation charges was around INR 400.00. Conclusion(s): This study shows that hemibody irradiation is not only an effective modality for palliation of severe bone pain in advanced cancer cases but also economical, involves short hospital stay, with acceptable side-effects, utilizes the simple Telecobalt machine, and is less cumbersome in comparison to other currently available pain palliation methods like oral morphine and radiopharmaceuticals. © 2014.

680,"Cellular response to an antisense-mediated shift of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing and antineoplastic agents Overexpression of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, negatively correlates with the sensitivity of various cancers to chemotherapeutic agents. We show here that high levels of expression of Bcl-xL promoted apoptosis of cells treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (5'Bcl-x AS) that shifts the splicing pattern of Bcl-x pre-mRNA from the anti-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xL, to the pro-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xS. This surprising finding illustrates the advantage of antisense-induced modulation of alternative splicing versus down-regulation of targeted genes. It also suggests a specificity of the oligonucleotide effects since non-cancerous cells with low levels of Bcl-xL should resist the treatment. 5'Bcl-x AS sensitized cells to several antineoplastic agents and radiation and was effective in promoting apoptosis of MCF-7/ADR cells, a breast cancer cell line resistant to doxorubicin via overexpression of the mdr1 gene. Efficacy of 5'Bcl-x AS combined with chemotherapeutic agents in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line may be translated to clinical prostate cancer since recurrent prostate cancer tissue samples expressed higher levels of Bcl-xL than benign prostate tissue. Treatment with 5'Bcl-x AS may enhance the efficacy of standard anti-cancer regimens and should be explored, especially in recurrent prostate cancer.",Excluded
56,"Surgical management of actinic cheilitis Objective: An analysis is made of the etiologic factors underlying actinic cheilitis and of the results obtained following surgical treatment of the disease in a series of 54 patients (32 males and 22 females). Study design: The case history was evaluated, along with the triggering factors, histopathological pattern and recurrence of lesions. A cold scalpel vermilionectomy was performed in 41 patients, followed by primary closure of the defect using an oral mucosal flap. The remaining 13 patients were subjected to carbon dioxide laser vermilion ablation. Result(s): The history of the patients revealed liver disease associated to alcohol consumption in 35.2% of cases and tobacco smoking in 77.8%. As regards solar exposure, 53.1% of the men referred open-air professional activities, while 100% of the women presented important solar exposure. The most frequent clinical manifestations were bleeding and the presence of leukoplakia patches; pain was reported in only 16% of cases. Over 40% of the patients were asymptomatic. Following treatment, and after a follow-up period of at least 6 months, 90.7% of the subjects showed complete healing. Of the 5 patients reoperated upon, four healed and one evolved towards squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion(s): Vermilionectomy is the recommended treatment for actinic cheilitis, using either a cold scalpel or carbon dioxide laser. A histological study of the lesion is indicated in all cases to secure early detection of possible malignization. The control of the possible etiologic factors is also essential.",Excluded

1226,"Estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction with low-dose gated tomographic radionuclide angiography using cadmium-zinc-telluride gamma camera in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy: A dramatic radiation reduction Background: Tomographic radionuclide angiography (TRA) is a simple non-invasive procedure which can monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with automatic processing software, resulting in excellent reproducibility. New gamma cameras using cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors enables reduction of the patient radiation dose. We compared LVEF and left ventricular (LV) volumes between low dose and standarddose TRA using a CZT camera. Method(s): Between September and December 2015, patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy and undergoing TRA were consecutively included. CZT acquisition was performed in <> after injection of 550MBq 99mTclabelled human serum albumin and lasted 7 minutes (recommended activity: 550-1110MBq, Society of Nuclear Medicine Guidelines). Each acquisition was analyzed full dose and equivalent half dose by the same physician, using the same software (Quantitative Blood Pool SPECT, Cedars Sinai) to generate LVEF and LV volumes. Result(s): 80 patients were analyzed (40% male, mean age 60 years and BMI 28 kg/m2). There was no significant difference in LVEF and LV systolic and diastolic volumes between full dose and equivalent half dose acquisition (p< 0.005). The contrasttonoise ratio wasn't visually decreased. Effective dose were 3.3 millisieverts (mSv) and 1.65mSv respectively for fulldose and equivalent halfdose acquisitions using our parameters. Conclusion(s): LVEF and LV volumes can accurately be determined using fast low-dose CZT acquisition (7 minutes, < 2mSv, below natural radiation) in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy. This dose reduction up to 50% from the lowest recommended administered activity allows repeated scans in those patients, with reduced dosimetry. Further dose reductions may be achievable.",Excluded
700,"Photic retinopathy after cataract surgery in diabetic patients PURPOSE: To report and emphasize photic retinopathy (PR) after cataract surgery in diabetic patients., METHODS: The charts of 2,573 patients who underwent cataract surgery at Baskent University Hospital (Ankara, Turkey) between January 2001 and December 2003 were retrospectively analyzed for PR and diabetes mellitus (DM). All surgeries were performed using the same coaxial illuminated microscope. The diagnosis of PR was confirmed by fluorescein angiography, showing typical mottled fluorescein transmission in a well circumscribed area in each case. Statistical analyses were performed with chi2 and Mann-Whitney U tests., RESULTS: Diagnoses of PR and DM were established in 16 cases (0.62%) and 382 cases (14.85%), respectively. DM was present in 7 (43.75%) of the PR cases. PR occurred more frequently in DM patients than in non-DM patients (7/382 vs. 9/2,191, respectively; P = 0.001; chi2= 10.64). All 16 patients with PR had received retrobulbar anesthesia (RA). RA was used in 61.21% of all surgeries and in 78.01% of the surgeries for DM patients. Occurrence of PR during RA was higher for DM patients than for non-DM patients (7/298 vs. 9/1,277, respectively; P = 0.011; chi2= 6.50). Mean operation times +/- SD for PR cases were 29.9 +/- 9.9 minutes and 38.2 +/- 5.3 minutes in DM and non-DM cases, respectively (P = 0.091). None of the photic lesions were sight threatening., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients may be more vulnerable to photic injury.

663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
250,"Environmental exposure to pyrethroids and sperm sex chromosome disomy: a cross-sectional study BACKGROUND: The role of environmental pesticide exposures, such as pyrethroids, and their relationship to sperm abnormalities are not well understood. This study investigated whether environmental exposure to pyrethroids was associated with altered frequency of sperm sex chromosome disomy in adult men.
METHODS: A sample of 75 subjects recruited through a Massachusetts infertility clinic provided urine and semen samples. Individual exposures were measured as urinary concentrations of three pyrethroid metabolites ((3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), cis- and trans- 3-(2,2-Dichlorovinyl)-1-methylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (CDCCA and TDCCA)). Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosomes X, Y, and 18 was used to determine XX, YY, XY, 1818, and total sex chromosome disomy in sperm nuclei. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the association between aneuploidy rates and pyrethroid metabolites while adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Between 25-56% of the sample were above the limit of detection (LOD) for the pyrethroid metabolites. All sex chromosome disomies were increased by 7-30% when comparing men with CDCCA and TDCCA levels above the LOD to those below the LOD. For 3PBA, compared to those below the LOD, those above the LOD had YY18 disomy rates 1.28 times higher (95% CI: 1.15, 1.42) whereas a reduced rate was seen for XY18 and total disomy (IRR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87; IRR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-0.97), and no association was seen for XX18 and 1818.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary concentrations of CDCCA and TDCCA above the LOD were associated with increased rates of aneuploidy. However the findings for 3BPA were not consistent. This is the first study to examine these relationships, and replication of our findings is needed before the association between pyrethroid metabolites and aneuploidy can be fully defined.",Excluded

Patient organ doses were analyzed by using dose-volume histograms and expressed by the mean, minimum dose delivered to 50% of the organ volume, D50. The reported doses are dose-to-medium instead of dose-to-water., RESULTS: The organ doses from all patient-specific calculations show predictable and limited ranges across patients. For brain isocenters using Standard Head Scans: Bone: 0.7-1.1 cGy, Brain: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Brainstem: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Skin: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Eye: 0.03-0.3 cGy. For head and neck patients using the Standard Head Scan: Bone: 0.3-0.6 cGy, Parotids: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Spinal Cord: 0.15-0.25 cGy, Thyroid: 0.1-0.25 cGy, Skin: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Trachea-Esophagus: 0.1-0.2 cGy. For chest using Thorax Scans: Bone: 1.1-1.8 cGy, Soft tissue organs (Bowel, Lung, Heart, Kidney, Esophagus, and Spinal Cord): 0.3-0.6 cGy. For abdominal site using Pelvic Scans: Bone: 3.2-4.2 cGy. Soft tissue organs (Bladder, Bowel, Rectum, Prostate, and Skin) D50s fell between 1.2 and 2.2 cGy. Femoral Heads: 2.5-3.4 cGy., CONCLUSIONS: It is adequate to estimate and account for organ dose by using tabulated values based on scan procedure and site because organ doses from imaging procedures are only modestly dependent upon scan location and body size. Considering the dose variation and magnitude of dose from each scan protocol in comparison to therapeutic doses, this approach provides a simple alternative to account for additional imaging guidance doses during patient treatment planning. Clinicians can use these tabulated values to make informed decisions in selecting the appropriate imaging procedures and imaging frequency during radiotherapy treatment.

872,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the serotonin 5-HT₆ ligand [¹¹C]GSK215083 determined from human whole-body PET PURPOSE: We measured the whole-body distribution of IV-injected [¹¹C]GSK215083, a new 5-HT₆ antagonist PET tracer, as a function of time in adult subjects, in order to determine the radiation exposure.
PROCEDURES: After injection with a single bolus of [¹¹C]GSK215083 (range 330-367 MBq; mean 346 MBq), PET emission data were acquired for approximately 120 min in six subjects (three males and three females). Five organs were identified as exhibiting uptake above background. For these, regions of interest were delineated on emission images, and time-activity curves (TAC) generated. Residence times were calculated as the area under the curve of the TAC, normalized to injected activities and standard values of organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were then performed using the computer program OLINDA/EXM 1.0.
RESULTS: The mean effective dose averaged over both males and females (deviation) was estimated to be 7.7 ± 1.0 μSv/MBq (male 7.0 ± 0.4; female 8.5 ± 0.6). For the effective dose equivalent, the corresponding values are 7.8 ± 1.2 μSv/MBq (male 6.8 ± 0.5; female 8.9 ± 0.1). The organ receiving the highest dose was the lung, with an average equivalent dose of 25.6 ± 6.9 μSv/MBq (male 20.8 ± 5.6; female 30.4 ± 4.4).
CONCLUSION: The estimated radiation dose for [¹¹C]GSK215083 is consistent with those for other neuroreceptor ligands labeled with carbon-11. The somewhat higher dose estimate for females compared to males may reflect the difference in observed residence times and representative differences in the male and female phantoms used for dosimetry calculations. Based on conventionally accepted dose limits, [¹¹C]GSK215083 may be used for multiple PET scans in the same subject.",Excluded
666,"Mammary gland tumors in irradiated and untreated guinea pigs This is a report of mammary gland tumors from 62 guinea pigs. The tumors arose in the terminal ductal-lobular units as either lobular acinar carcinoma or cystadenocarcinoma or as papillary carcinomas within large ducts near the mammilla. About half the number of the males had terminal ductal-lobular carcinomas and all but 2 of the papillary duct carcinomas also arose in males. Large tumors frequently exhibited squamous, chondromatous, osseous, fatty and myoepitheliomatous types of tissues. In 2 irradiated males and 1 female the tumors metastasized. Whole-body irradiation did not produce significant changes in the number or sex distribution or in the morphology of mammary gland tumors in inbred or outbred guinea pigs. All females had cystic ovaries without increase in granulosa cells, 24 (66.6%) had uterine tumors and 13 (34.2%) had adrenal gland tumors; all males had atrophic testes, 5 (16.5%) had testicular and 6 (22.2%) had adrenal gland tumors.",Included
938,"Radiation Exposure and Safety Precautions Following 131Cs Brachytherapy in Patients with Brain Tumors Cesium-131 (Cs) brachytherapy is a safe and convenient treatment option for patients with resected brain tumors. This study prospectively analyzes radiation exposure in the patient population who were treated with a maximally safe neurosurgical resection and Cs brachytherapy. Following implantation, radiation dose rate measurements were taken at the surface, 35 cm, and 100 cm distances. Using the half-life of Cs (9.69 d), the dose rates were extrapolated at these distances over a period of time (t = 30 d). Data from dosimetry badges and rings worn by surgeons and radiation oncologists were collected and analyzed. Postoperatively, median dose rate was 0.2475 mSv h, 0.01 mSv h, and 0.001 mSv h and at 30 d post-implant, 0.0298 mSv h, 0.0012 mSv h, and 0.0001 mSv h at the surface, 35 cm, and 100 cm, respectively. All but one badge and ring measured a dose equivalent corresponding to ~0 mSv h, while 1 badge measured 0.02/0.02/0.02 mSv h. There was a significant correlation between the number of seeds implanted and dose rate at the surface (p = 0.0169). When stratified by the number of seeds: 4-15 seeds (n = 14) and 20-50 seeds (n = 4) had median dose rates of 0.1475 mSv h and 0.5565 mSv h, respectively (p = 0.0015). Using National Council on Radiation Protection guidelines, this study shows that dose equivalent from permanent Cs brachytherapy for the treatment of brain tumors is limited, and it maintains safe levels of exposure to family and medical personnel. Such information is critical knowledge for the neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, nurses, hospital staff, and family as this method is gaining nationwide popularity.",Excluded

459,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded
885,"Lung dosimetry of inhaled radon progeny in mice Biological response of exposure to radon progeny has long been investigated, but there are only few studies in which absorbed doses in lungs of laboratory animals were estimated. The present study is the first attempt to calculate the doses of inhaled radon progeny for mice. For reference, the doses for rats and humans were also computed with the corresponding models. Lung deposition of particles, their clearance, and energy deposition of alpha particles to sensitive tissues were systematically simulated. Absorbed doses to trachea and bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, alveolar-interstitial regions, and whole lung were first provided as a function of monodisperse radon progeny particles with an equilibrium equivalent radon concentration of 1 Bq m(-3) (equilibrium factor, 0.4 and unattached fraction, 0.01). Based on the results, absorbed doses were then calculated for (1) a reference mine condition and (2) a condition previously used for animal experiments. It was found that the whole lung doses for mice, rats, and humans were 34.8, 20.7, and 10.7 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the mine condition, respectively, while they were 16.9, 9.9, and 6.5 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the animal experimental condition. In both cases, the values for mice are about 2 times higher than those for rats, and about 3 times higher than those for humans. Comparison of our data on rats and humans with those published in the literature shows an acceptable agreement, suggesting the validity of the present modeling for mice. In the future, a more sophisticated dosimetric study of inhaled radon progeny in mice would be desirable to demonstrate how anatomical, physiological, and environmental parameters can influence absorbed doses.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): In 36 patients (4 female, 32 male, mean age 65 years; range 33 88) with a pulmonary nodule, we performed CT-guided biopsy using a 18G Tru-cut needle (Cardinal Health, Dublin, UK) in a 64 row dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Definition, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) using intermittent imaging of the needle. In half of the patients (2 female, 16 male, mean age 67 years), an interactive breath-hold control system (IBC) (Mayo Clinic Medical Devices, USA) was applied. No additional device was used in the control group. Result(s): The biopsy was visually successful in all patients. The diameter of the target lesion was comparable in both groups (IBC: 30 +/- 19 mm; control: 28 +/- 15 mm). The number of imaging steps was significantly smaller (p < 0.05) and the intervention time was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) in the IBC group (IBC: 9 +/- 5 steps 17 +/- 10 min; control: 13 +/- 5 steps 26 +/- 12 min).

195,"A system for in vivo measurement of bone calcium by local neutron activation of the hand A 252Cf neutron-irradiation facility designed specifically for clinical in vivo measurement of calcium in the hand is described. Results of preliminary measurements are presented. Hand phantoms were exposed to the neutron beam for 10 min and the induced 49Ca activities were counted for 10 min after an elapsed time of 2 min. The results indicate that with a 2 X 100 micrograms 252Cf neutron source and two 20.3 X 12.7 cm NaI crystals, the counts per gram of bone mineral mass changes by about 4% for each 100 cm3 change in the overall volume (soft tissue plus bone) of the hand. For hands of equal volumes the counts per gram are expected to be almost independent of the bone volume. With an absorbed dose equivalent of 150 mSv (15 rem), the sensitivity is about 200 counts per 10 min per gram Ca. The statistical reproducibility of the results is better than 3% for the average value of 11 g Ca in the normal hand.",Excluded

968,"Collagen organisation in the interspinous ligament and its relationship to tissue function X-ray diffraction and determination of optical anisotropy show that collagen fibres in pig and human lumbar interspinous ligaments tend to be orientated parallel to the spinous processes. There is a distribution of fibre orientations about this preferred direction. Flexion of the spine does not change the direction of preferred orientation but the angular spread of fibres increases. This pattern of collagen fibre orientations is consistent with the interspinous ligaments being able to transmit tension from the thoracolumbar fascia to the vertebrae. Since the collagen fibres tend to be aligned antero-posteriorly, they provide a high efficiency of reinforcement in this direction. The lack of fibres orientated perpendicular to the spinous processes will lead to low strength in the cranio-caudal direction so that the ligament can provide little resistance to flexion of the spine.",Excluded

919,"The origin of cell surface immunoglobulin of marrow-derived and thymus-derived lymphocytes of the rat The origin of immunoglobulin on the surface of TDL in the rat has been studied by comparing the binding of purified alloantibodies recognizing the Ig-1a allotype of rat light chain, with that of rabbit antirat Fab antibodies. Both reagents labeled all TDL from rats of the DA strain (Ig-1a) with two categories of cells being detected; one binding 100-2,000 molecules of antibody, the other 10,000-100,000 molecules. These categories were likely to be synonomous with T and B cells, respectively. The [(125)I]antiallotype antibodies did not bind to TDL from rats of the PVG/c strain (Ig-1b). When the binding to TDL from (PVG/c x DA)F(1) animals was studied it was found that allelic exclusion occurred in the heavily labeled cells, but not in the lightly labeled ones. Furthermore, when lymphocytes of one allotype were transferred to irradiated recipients of the opposite allotype and recovered from the TDL or spleen of the recipient 20-30 h later, the immunoglobulin on heavily labeled cells was of the donor type, while that of lightly labeled ones bore the recipient marker. Thus heavily labeled cells (B lymphocytes) had synthesized their own immunoglobulin while lightly labeled cells (T lymphocytes) had acquired theirs passively by adsorption. The class of immunoglobulin on lightly labeled cells was also studied and it was found that [(125)I]anti-IgM antibodies bound to an extent approaching the [(125)I]anti-Fab binding, while [(125)I]anti-IgG(2a+2b) antibodies gave much less binding.",Excluded
159,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves deglutition in Parkinson's disease Relatively little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in human deglutition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) affords us a model for examining deglutition in humans with known impairment of the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of subthalamic nuclei (STN) DBS on the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of normal"" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.

208,"Whitacre needle reduces the incidence of intravascular uptake in lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections Background: Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) is a commonly used interventional pain management procedures to treat radicular leg pain. Although most reported complications of TFESI are minor, serious morbidity has also been demonstrated including spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, and quadriparesis. Suggested mechanisms include direct vascular injury or intravascular injection of particulate steroid. Objective(s): We compared 2 different needle types, Whitacre and Quincke type needles, with regard to intravascular injection rate with total procedure time and the amount of radiation during lumbar TFESI. Study Design: Prospective, randomized trial. Setting(s): An interventional pain management practice in South Korea. Method(s): After Institutional Review Board approval, 149 patients undergoing lumbar TFESI for radicular leg pain were randomly assigned to one of 2 needle groups (Whitacre needle or Quincke type needle). After final confirmation of intravascular injection with digital subtraction angiography, total procedure time and amount of radiation exposure during TFESI were measured. Result(s): The overall incidence of intravascular injection was 10.4% (28/269). We analyzed the overall incidence of intravascular injection according to the 2 different needle types. The incidence of intravascular injection of the Whitacre needle was 5.4% (8/146), whereas the incidence of intravascular injection of the Quincke needle was 16.2% (20/123). Total procedure time and amount of radiation required to complete the TFESI in the Whitacre and Quincke needle groups was 168.4 +/- 57.9 (seconds) and 33.4 +/- 15.9 (cGy/cm2), 131.9 +/- 46.0 (seconds) and 33.2 +/- 15.8 (cGy/cm2), respectively. Limitation(s): The physician who performed the TFESI was not blinded to the type of needle for detecting intravascular injection. This study was focused on lumbar TFESI, however, most TFESIs are performed at the L4-5 or L5-S1 level. Conclusion(s): The Whitacre needle had the benefit of reducing the incidence of intravascular injection with minimal differences in technical difficulties and the amount of radiation exposure during lumbar TFESI.Copyright © 2015, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

Therefore, target immobilization by general anesthesia with high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) instead of conventional ventilation (CV) with repeated breath-holds may facilitate and speed up navigation of RF ablation probes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous RF ablation of liver (n = 9) or renal tumors (n = 10) with CT guidance under HFJV (n = 9) or CV (n = 10) were included. The choice of the anesthesiologic technique was left to the discretion of the interventionalist. Complexity of the intervention (ie, number of lesions ablated per session, conspicuity of the lesion on nonenhanced CT, and access pathway), volume of the ablated tissue, radiation exposure, and complications were compared between the HFJV and CV groups., RESULTS: In this feasibility study, a statistically significant radiation dose reduction (P < .05) was noted in the HFJV group compared with the CV group for liver and renal RF ablation. No complications were observed in the HFJV group, whereas renal subcapsular hematoma (n = 2) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1) occurred in the CV group., CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous CT-guided navigation of RF ablation probes under HFJV is feasible and safe. It might be advantageous for the treatment of complex kidney and liver tumors, allowing less irradiation exposure to the patient and the interventional radiologist. Copyright © 2011 SIR.

Methods: The cohort consisted of 1224 HNC patients treated with 66-68 Gy in 2007-2015 predominantly with IMRT. ORN cases were defined from clinical observations at follow-up and through hospital code diagnostics after oral-maxillofacial surgery and cross-checked with the national Danish Head and Neck Cancer database. In a nested case-control study, patients with ORN cases were matched with two controls (1:2) and pre-RT dental procedures including surgery to the mandible were documented. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied using demographic and treatment variables including dental procedures, smoking and tumor characteristics, and combined with dosimetric data. Mean mandibular dose (Dmean) was pre-selected for the multivariable model. Results: ORN was recorded in 56 cases (4.6%) with a median time to event of 10.9 months (range 1.8-89.7) after RT, 90% occurred within 37.4 months. Median follow-up time was 22 months (0.3-95). Average Dmean was significantly higher in the ORN event cohort and significant dose-volume differences were observed for population mean DVH doses between 30 Gy and 60 Gy. In univariable analysis, smoking (HR = 1.69; CI 1.14-2.5), pre-RT surgery/tooth extraction (HR = 2.76; 1.48-5.14), and several dosimetric parameters including Dmean (HR = 1.05, 1.02-1.08) were all significantly associated with ORN. Dmean and surgery/tooth extraction remained significant predictors of ORN in multivariable analysis, HR = 1.04 (CI 1.01-1.07) and HR = 2.09 (CI 1.1-3.98), respectively, while smoking only retained its significance in an interaction analysis with pre-RT dental procedures. Conclusion: The onset of ORN of the mandible was early (median 10.8 months) and the incidence low (4.6%) after IMRT in HNC cancer patients.

The cutoff value of V1-2 SRd obtained by ROC curve analysis was 1.625 mV for prediction of RVOT origin (sensitivity: 95.1%, specificity: 85.5%, positive predictive value: 86.5%, negative predictive value: 94.5%). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.929 (p < .001)., CONCLUSION: S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel and simple electrocardiographic criterion for accurately differentiating RVOT from LVOT sites of ventricular arrhythmia origins. The use of this simple ECG measurement could improve the accuracy of OTVA localization, could be beneficial for decreasing ablation duration and radiation exposure. Further studies with larger patient population are needed to verify the results of this study. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
128,"Operative management of periarticular medial clavicle fractures - Report of ten cases BACKGROUND: The periarticular medial clavicle fracture is a rare injury and can be treated conservatively in the majority of cases. However, up to 8% of the patients develop symptomatic nonunion, and fracture dislocation correlates with the number of poor functional results. Operative treatment may be beneficial in these cases. Studies with large series of operated patients are still missing. METHOD(S): We investigated 10 patients with operative treatment of periarticular medial clavicle fractures. Preoperative X-ray or computed tomography scan was obtained, and follow-up assessment was performed at determined intervals, including physical examination and X-ray evaluation of bone healing. Finally, functional assessment was carried out from September 2009 to July 2010 using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. RESULT(S): All operated patients had displaced periarticular medial clavicle fractures. A direct surgical approach was performed, and denudation of the bone fragments was avoided. In 8 of 10 cases, we used locking plates, preferentially the T-locking plate. In 6 of 10 patients, three screws were placed in the medial fragment or the sternum. The arm was immobilized in a sling for 2 weeks to 3 weeks, followed by careful passive and increasing active motion exercises. In 9 of 10 operated patients, we observed fracture healing and good functional results. Two patients with paraplegia/tetraplegia were excluded from final assessment but demonstrated fracture healing. In one case, we observed early material loosening caused by misused locking system and wound infection. CONCLUSION(S): Operative treatment can be considered for periarticular, dislocated medial-end clavicle fractures. Computed tomography scan can be useful for operative planning and is mostly performed in patients with multiple injuries. Locking plates, such as the T-locking plate or the pilon reconstruction plate, are preferred devices. For rigid fixation, at least three locking screws should be placed in the medial bone fragment. The plate can be removed 18 months after osteosynthesis. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
333,"Integration of functional MRI and white matter tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
13,"Thin-plate spline analysis of the cranial base in African, Asian and European populations and its relationship with different malocclusions OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that midline basicranial orientation and posterior cranial base length are discriminating factors between adults of different populations and its potential maxillo/mandibular disharmonies., DESIGN: Twenty-nine 2D landmarks of the midline cranial base, the face and the mandible of dry skull X-rays from three major populations (45 Asians, 34 Africans, 64 Europeans) were digitized and analysed by geometric morphometrics. We used, first, MANOVA to test for mean shape differences between populations; then, principal components analysis (PCA) to assess the overall variation in the sample and finally, canonical variate analysis (CVA) with jack-knife validations (N=1000) to analyse the anatomical features that best distinguished among populations., RESULTS: Significant mean shapes differences were shown between populations (P<0.001). CVA revealed two significant axes of discrimination (P<0.001). Jack-knife validation correctly identified 92% of 15,000 unknowns. In Africans the whole cranial base is rotated into a forward-downward position, while in Asians it is rotated in the opposite way. The Europeans occupied an intermediate position. African and Asian samples showed a maxillo/mandibular prognathism. African prognathism was produced by an anterior positioned maxilla, Asian prognathism by retruded anterior cranial base and increase of the posterior cranial base length. Europeans showed a trend towards retracted mandibles with relatively shorter posterior cranial bases., CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the hypothesis that basicranial orientation and posterior cranial base length are valid factors to distinguish between geographic groups. The whole craniofacial configuration underlying a particular maxillo-facial disharmony must be considered in diagnosis, growth predictions and resulting treatment planning.",Excluded
961,"Unipedicular versus bipedicular percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: A prospective randomized study Background: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) typically involves conventional lower-viscosity cement injection via bipedicular approach. Limited evidence is available comparing the clinical outcomes and complications in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with PVP using high-viscosity cement through unipedicular or bipedicular approach. Methods and design: Fifty patients with OVCFs were randomly allocated into two groups adopting unipedicular or bipedicular PVP. The efficacy of unipedicular and bipedicular PVP was assessed by comparing operation time, X-ray exposure time, incidence of complications, vertebral height restoration, and improvement of the visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) General Health Survey scores. Result(s): The mean operative and exposure time to X-rays in the unipedicular PVP group was less than that of the bipedicular group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in the VAS score, ODI score, SF-36 score, cement leakage rate or vertebral height restoration between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Unipedicular and bipedicular PVP are safe and effective treatments for OVCF. Compared with bipedicular PVP, unipedicular PVP entails a shorter surgical time and lower X-ray irradiation.Copyright © 2015 Zhang et al.",Excluded
913,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas? Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included
174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded
881,"Anal cancer treated with radio-chemotherapy: Correlation between length of treatment interruption and outcome Aim: The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the feasibility and outcome of definitive radio-chemotherapy without split-course technique but with individualised short treatment interruption in anal cancer patients. Method(s): Between 1993 and 2008, 101 patients with anal cancer were treated in our institution with definitive radio-chemotherapy with individualised short treatment interruptions. Treatment was halted independent of dose in case of acute grade 3 toxicities and started again until improvement. Short interruption was defined as completing treatment without exceeding six cumulative treatment days beyond a scheduled plan; otherwise, it was defined as prolonged interruption. Result(s): Median overall treatment time was 47 days corresponding to an interruption of six cumulative treatment days. Fifty-one patients (50%) had treatment interruption of >=6 days. No acute grade 4 toxicities were observed. One fatality occurred during treatment due to ileus-like symptoms according to acute grade 5 toxicity. After a median follow-up of 56 months, the 5-year actuarial rates for local control comparing patients with short vs. prolonged treatment interruption were 78% vs. 81% (p=0.904) and, for colostomy-free survival, 83% vs. 85% (p=0.784), respectively.

539,"UK national cohort of anal cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: One-year oncological and patient-reported outcomes BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for anal cancer. Following national UK implementation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), this prospective, national cohort evaluates the one-year oncological outcomes and patient-reported toxicity outcomes (PRO) after treatment., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national cohort of UK cancer centers implementing IMRT was carried out between February to July 2015. Cancer centers provided data on oncological outcomes, including survival, and disease and colostomy status at one-year. EORTC-QLQ core (C30) and colorectal (CR29) questionnaires were completed at baseline and one-year followup. The PRO scores at baseline and one year were compared., RESULTS: 40 UK Cancer Centers returned data with a total of 187 patients included in the analysis. 92% received mitomycin with 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. One-year overall survival was 94%; 84% were disease-free and 86% colostomy-free at one-year followup. At one year, PRO results found significant improvements in buttock pain, blood and mucus in stools, pain, constipation, appetite loss, and health anxiety compared to baseline. No significant deteriorations were reported in diarrhea, bowel frequency, and flatulence. Urinary symptom scores were low at one year. Moderate impotence symptoms at baseline remained at one year, and a moderate deterioration in dyspareunia reported., CONCLUSIONS: With national anal cancer IMRT implementation, at this early pre-defined time point, one-year oncological outcomes were reassuring and resulted in good disease-related symptom control. one-year symptomatic complications following CRT for anal cancer using IMRT techniques appear to be relatively mild. These PRO results provide a basis to benchmark future studies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1231,"Radiation therapy for leukemia cutis Purpose: Leukemia cutis (LC) is the infiltration of the epidermis, dermis, or subcutis by neoplastic leukocytes, resulting in clinically identifiable cutaneous lesions. Electron-based radiation therapy (RT) is often used in the treatment of LC; however, modern studies of RT are lacking. We reviewed our experience to analyze treatment response, disease control, and toxicity associated with RT in order to develop treatment recommendations for patients with LC. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients who underwent treatment for LC at our institution from November 1994 to August 2009 were identified and their medical records were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): LC presented after a median of 2 (range 0-24) months from acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis. Median survival from time of LC presentation was 23 months (range 0.5-137 months). Thirteen courses of radiation were administered to 12 patients: 9 total skin electron beam (TSEB) therapy and 4 focal treatments. Of patients receiving TSEB, 89% had diffuse LC involvement and 67% were in marrow remission. By contrast, only 25% of patients receiving focal therapy had diffuse LC involvement and only 25% were in marrow remission. Median TSEB dose was 1600 (range 600-2400) cGy. Fifty percent of patients had a complete response to RT but 1-year local control was only 33%. All patients who developed a skin relapse either had active marrow disease at the time of RT or marrow recurrence shortly thereafter. Median survival since RT was 5 (range 0.5-136) months. RT was well tolerated without significant acute effects; however, 1 patient receiving chemotherapy developed radiation recall 1 month after RT. Conclusion(s): Patients with LC have aggressive disease with few long-term survivors. Definitive treatment with TSEB should be utilized only in cases of marrow remission with focal electron therapy reserved for palliation of symptomatic lesions. Long-term prognosis and durable cutaneous remission is dependent on systemic disease control. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded

974,"Long-term outcome and patterns of failure in primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma treated with radiotherapy Purpose/Objective(s): MALT lymphomas have generally been believed to follow a relatively indolent course and show a tendency to remain localized within their original environment for a long period of time. Therefore, there has been no consensus regarding the initial management of primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (POAML) so far; radiotherapy has been generally considered the most effective treatment for localized disease. Although results from local control by radiotherapy were satisfying, disease progression occurred in a fraction of the patients. There have been few analyses on its behavior of progression and death that focused on patients with POAML. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term treatment outcome and disease behavior of POAML. Materials/Methods: Seventy-eight patients (42 male and 36 female) diagnosed with POAML between 1991 and 2010 at Kobe University Hospital were included. The median age was 60-years old (range: 22 - 85). The median radiation dose administered was 30.6 Gy. Survival data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 65 months. Major tumor sites were conjunctivas in 37 (47%), orbita in 29 (37%), and lacrimal glands in 12 (15%) patients. The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) rates were both 100%, and the 5- and 10-year recurrence- free survival (RFS) rates were 88.5% and 75.9%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 98.1% and 95.3%, respectively. Patients treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy had a trend for a better RFS compared to those treated with radiotherapy alone (p = 0.114). None developed greater than G2 acute morbidity. For late morbidities, retinal disorders occurred in 7 patients (9%), glaucoma in 1 (1%), dry eye in 4 (5%), and cataracts in 37 (47%). Conclusion(s): Radiotherapy for POAML was shown to be highly effective and safe for local control and overall survival based on long-term observation.

165,"Abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): proof of principle in an experimental model of colon cancer The aim of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3. The present study performed in a simple animal model provides proof of principle that the positive response of a tumor to BNCT is capable of inducing an abscopal effect.",Excluded
178,"A 20-minute breath test for helicobacter pylori In this study, we evaluated a simplified rapid 14C-urea breath test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori. Fasting patients undergoing initial assessment for H. pylori drank 5 microCi of 14C-urea in 20 ml of water. Breath was collected at intervals for 30 min. Samples were counted in a beta-counter, and the results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm).

192,"Apparent migration of implantable port devices: normal variations in consideration of BMI PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded
371,"Effect of proton pump inhibitors on hepatic regeneration INTRODUCTION: The liver is critical in multiple processes, including the clearance of endogenous compounds, the synthesis of macromolecules, and organ-specific biotransformation processes. Therefore, the liver's regenerating capacity is of vital importance. Multiple pathways are activated in the complex process that leads to hepatic regeneration. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitors omeprozole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole on hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups were formed with 32 rats in each. Partial liver resections were performed for all animals. Omeprazole (71.4 microg/day), lansoprazole (107 microg/day), pantoprazole (143 microg/day) and placebo (0.5 cm(3)) were administered to the groups respectively. A quarter of the rats in each group were sacrificed on the 1st postoperative day. The rest were sacrificed on the 3rd, 5th and 7th postoperative days. The remnant regenerating liver mass was removed and weighed, and Ki-67 monoclonal antibody levels were measured., RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the four groups on the first day in evaluating the weight of the liver mass (p = 0.09) and Ki-67 (p = 0.268) levels. Only the omeprazole group showed a difference; the Ki-67 level was lower in the omeprazole group on the 3rd (p = 0.003, p = 0.0001, p = 0.003), 5th (p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p = 0.0001) and 7th (p = 0.0001) days compared to the other groups. Also the weight of the remnant liver mass was lower in the omeprazole group on the 3rd, 5th and 7th (p = 0.0001) days., CONCLUSION: We figured out that lansoprazole and pantoprazole have no effects on liver regeneration, whereas omeprazole showed a negative effect on hepatic regeneration.",Excluded

The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center olfactory test was administered at 1 week before treatment and at the third week and the first year after treatment. Triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, and antithyroglobulin levels were measured 1 week before treatment and 2 weeks after treatment., RESULTS: The smell threshold test, smell identification test, and total smell scores showed statistically significant decreases after treatment when compared with the pretreatment scores (p = 0.000). No significant differences were noted between the late term and early term after RAI for either the identification score (p = 0.502) or the total score (p = 0.051).

59,"Preferential damage to IgM production by ultraviolet B in the cells of patients with Bloom's syndrome In most patients with Bloom's syndrome (BS), selective IgM deficiency is commonly found. We examined proliferative responses by incorporation of [3H]-thymidine and the production of immunoglobulin after ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in the cells of two patients with BS. With regard to the proliferative responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultured with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), the patients' PBMC were more sensitive to UVB irradiation than controls. Although the effect of UVB irradiation in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) after 0 days of culture showed no difference between one patient and controls, the patient's LCL were more sensitive to UVB than the controls after 3 and 7 days of culture. These results suggest that the proliferative responses of the patient's LCL recovered later than those of controls. IgM production was the most sensitive to UVB in the patients' PBMC and LCL. IgG and IgA production in the patients' PBMC and LCL showed the same sensitivity as controls. From our results, it is suspected that the preferential damage to IgM production by UVB is connected with the selective IgM deficiency of BS.",Excluded
730,"Estimating the burden of lung cancer and the efficiency of home radon mitigation systems in some Canadian provinces Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of death of cancer in Canada in both men and women, and indoor radon is the second leading cause of LC after tobacco smoking. The Population Attributable Risk (PAR) is used to assess radon exposure risk. In this work we estimate the burden of LC in some Canadian provinces. We use the PAR to identify the radon levels responsible for most LC cases. Finally, we use the PAR function of the two variables, radon action and target levels, to search for a possible optimal mitigation program., METHODS: The LC burden for Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and British Columbia was estimated using provincial radon and mortality data. Then the PAR and LC cases for these provinces were estimated over the period 2006-2009 at different given indoor radon exposure levels. Finally, the PAR function when radon action levels and radon target levels are variables was analyzed., RESULTS: The highest burden of LC in 2006-2009 was in Ontario and Quebec. During the period 2006-2009, 6% of houses in Ontario, 9% of houses in Alberta, 19% of houses in Manitoba, 7% of houses in Quebec, and 5% of houses in British Columbia had radon levels higher than 200Bq/m3 and were responsible about 913, 211, 260, 972, and 258 lives, respectively. Radon mitigation programs could have prevented these LC cases. The BEIR VI assumption for the United States (US) population, 95% of LC deaths in men and 90% of LC deaths in women are Ever-Smokers (ES), can be applied to the Canadian population. The PAR is a linear function in the target radon value with an estimated slope of 0.0001 for Ontario, Alberta, Quebec and British Columbia, and 0.0004 for Manitoba. The PAR is almost a square root function in the radon action level. The PAR is sensitive to changes in the radon mitigation program and as such, any improvement is a worthwhile investment.

781,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included
555,"Chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection: an experience with 22 patients The authors present their experience of chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection in 22 patients. The patients are from a series of 80 patients treated by chest wall resection from 1967 to 1989. Whether performed on breasts still in place, for recurrent disease, or for radiation-induced lesions (which are often associated), the defect created by complete resection of the chest wall layers causes difficulties. Large cutaneous flaps, often including the opposite breast were used at the beginning of the series. Then came omentum associated to Mersilene mesh and myocutaneous flaps. The results, in terms of comfort and local control are acceptable, even though surgery is only palliative for cancer patients. We feel that full thickness chest wall resection is the only effective treatment for some primary and recurrent malignant tumors and for extensive thoracic radionecroses. Such procedures are designed to improve the patient's quality of life even if they do not actually prolong survival. The goals guiding the reconstruction programme are: (1) the restoration of a stable parietal rigidity; and (2) the reconstruction of long lasting superficial layers.",Excluded
708,"Uranium in drinking water: Renal effects of long-term ingestion by an aboriginal community The authors conducted a study of an aboriginal community to determine if kidney func-tion had been affected by the chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water from the community's drilled wells. Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480). This study indicates that at the observed levels of uranium intake, chemical toxicity would be a greater health concern than would radiation dose. © 2009 Heldref Publications.",Included
296,"Longwave ultraviolet radiation (UVA, 320-400 nm)-induced tan protects human skin against further UVA injury The protective effect of a UVA (320-400 nm) induced tan against cutaneous injury by further UVA-irradiation was studied by evaluating the histopathologic changes in tanned and untanned normal human buttock skin 24 h after exposure to 2 and 4 minimal erythema doses of UVA. In each subject there were fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes and less endothelial cell prominence and vessel wall necrosis in the UVA tanned skin than in the untanned UVA-irradiated skin. In the tanned control and tanned UVA-irradiated skin there was a prominent mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate that was much greater than in untanned skin. In immunoperoxidase stained tissue sections, the mononuclear cells were predominantly T cells, and in all of the specimens the number of phenotypic helper/inducer cells exceeded the phenotypic cytotoxic/suppressor cells. This demonstrates that a UVA tan provides photoprotection against acute UVA exposure. In addition, tanning, with or without further UVA-irradiation, was associated with a mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate.",Excluded

1187,"Chronic Actinic Dermatitis: a Review Purpose of Review: To update readers on the current understandings of chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) in regard to epidemiology, clinical findings, pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis. Recent Findings: CAD is classically thought to be primarily a disease of elderly Caucasian males, though recent evidence suggests that in skin of color, the disease manifests more often in younger females. Recent studies suggest the pathogenesis of CAD involves a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction, similar to allergic contact dermatitis. There is also evidence of resistance to UV-induced immunosuppression in these patients, similar to polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). Furthermore, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio on flow cytometry in CAD patients has been correlated with increased tissue burden of disease. Photoprotection remains a mainstay of treatment, though recent evidence suggests potential efficacy of tofacitinib or short courses of narrowband UVB phototherapy as treatment options. Summary: CAD is an immunologically mediated photodermatosis characterized by pruritic eczematous lesions of sun-exposed areas, most commonly seen in older Caucasian males. While the pathogenesis of the condition is not fully understood, a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction to UV-induced neoantigens is thought to play a role. Photoprotection remains the mainstay of treatment, though adjunctive treatments are rapidly emerging. Though considered a chronic condition, CAD tends to improve over time.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

939,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded
1006,"Initial evaluation of safety of wide-field irradiation in the treatment of hematopoietic neoplasia in the cat Localized radiation therapy is well tolerated in cats with confined tumors; however, the use of wide-field radiation therapy to treat disseminated neoplasia has not been evaluated systematically in this species. Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected. In summary, wide-field external beam radiation therapy can be administered safely to, and may provide therapeutic benefit for, cats with disseminated hematopoietic neoplasia. © 2010 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.",Included
286,"The Value of Computed Tomography Imaging of the Head After Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery in Adults BACKGROUND: Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus often undergo multiple follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, increasing the risk for long-term effects of ionizing radiation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the necessity as a routine diagnostic procedure and cost analysis of routine postoperative CT scan of the head after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. METHODS: In this study, we comprised adults with ventriculoperitoneal shunt operations who underwent early CT scans within 48 hours postoperatively. We reviewed the correlation between revision surgery rate and the experience of surgeons who performed surgery and provided a cost analysis. RESULTS: In total, 479 surgeries were performed in 439 patients. Early revision surgery was performed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Reason for revision surgery was malposition in 9 cases and intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between the surgeon's experience and the rate of revision surgery. Placement of the ventricular catheter via an approach other than a standard right or left frontal burr hole resulted in risk of need for surgical shunt revision (P >= 0.002, odds ratio 54, confidence interval 13.5-223). A total of 468 CT scans of the head revealed a normal finding; thus, ~$562,000 could be saved by omitting postoperative head CT scans. CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative head CT scans after fentriculoperitoneal shunting are not necessary in all cases. The reduction of exposure to ionization radiation and the beneficial economic factor are main advantages.",Excluded
833,"Self-taught axillary vein access without venography for pacemaker implantation: prospective randomized comparison with the cephalic vein access Aim: Axillary vein access for pacemaker implantation is uncommon in many centres because of the lack of training in this technique. We assessed whether the introduction of the axillary vein technique was safe and efficient as compared with cephalic vein access, in a centre where no operators had any previous experience in axillary vein puncture., Methods and results: Patients undergoing pacemaker implantation were randomized to axillary or cephalic vein access. All three operators had no experience nor training in axillary vein puncture, and self-learned the technique by reading a published review. Axillary vein puncture was fluoroscopy-guided without contrast venography. Cephalic access was performed by dissection of delto-pectoral groove. Venous access success, venous access duration (from skin incision to guidewire or lead in superior vena cava), procedure duration, X-ray exposure, and peri-procedural (1 month) complications were recorded. results We randomized 74 consecutive patients to axillary (n = 37) or cephalic vein access (n = 37). Axillary vein was successfully accessed in 30/37 (81.1%) patients vs. 28/37 (75.7%) of cephalic veins (P = 0.57). Venous access time was shorter in axillary group than in cephalic group [5.7 (4.4-8.3) vs. 12.2 (10.5-14.8) min, P < 0.001], as well as procedure duration [34.8 (30.6-38.4) vs. 42.0 (39.1-46.6) min, P = 0.043]. X-ray exposure and peri-procedural overall complications were comparable in both groups. Axillary puncture was safe and faster than cephalic access even for the five first procedures performed by each operator., Conclusion: Self-taught axillary vein puncture for pacemaker implantation seems immediately safe and faster than cephalic vein access, when performed by electrophysiologists trained to pacemaker implantation but not to axillary vein puncture.

560,"Stereotactic radiosurgery and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for management of vestibular schwannomas: initial experience with 17 cases BACKGROUND: Nowadays radiation treatment of patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs) applied either as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) represents a real alternative to surgical tumor resection., METHODS: During 2010-2011, 17 consecutive patients (19-75 years old) with a VS underwent treatment with SRS or SRT in our center. Microsurgery was initially offered in all cases but was declined for various reasons. Five lesions recurred after the initial partial resection. Two other patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 underwent initial surgery for a large tumor on the contralateral side and had the only hearing ear on the side of the remaining neoplasm. Three elderly persons had somatic problems that were too severe for them to undergo craniotomy. Five small tumors without brain stem compression underwent single-fraction SRS (12.0-12.5 Gy at the 80 % isodose line). Other patients, mainly with large neoplasms that caused brain stem compression, were treated with hypofractionated SRT (five or six daily fractions at a dose of 4.5-5.0 Gy each). Treatment was performed with a dedicated linear accelerator (Elekta Axesse). Various stereotactic fixation devices were used: Leksell G frame, noninvasive HeadFIX frame, reinforced thermoplastic masks., RESULTS: No adverse reactions or complications were seen in any case. Within 3 months after treatment three tumors demonstrated shrinkage accompanied by improvement of the neurological functions., CONCLUSION: Radiation treatment, particularly hypofractionated SRT, can be safely applied even for large VSs that cause brain stem compression and are accompanied by prominent neurological symptoms.",Excluded

Eight patients had detectable rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma-gene demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) in the peripheral blood. The median age was 47 years and the median duration of disease before SCT was 61 months; Peripheral blood progenitor cells were mobilized using high-dose etoposide (1.6 g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The apheresis products underwent rigorous T-cell depletion with immunomagnetic methods. Double CD34-positive and CD4/CD8-negative selection achieved a median reduction of 3.89 log of T cells. All nine patients have been transplanted. Conditioning included carmustine (BCNU), etoposide and melphalan (BEM) in seven patients and total body irradiation plus etoposide or melphalan in two. Eight patients engrafted promptly and one patient died of septicaemia. All survivors entered complete remission. Seven patients have relapsed at a median of 7 months (2-14) post SCT. However, most patients have relapsed into a less aggressive stage, which has responded to conventional therapy. Four out of seven evaluable patients had detectable TCR rearrangements in the T-cell depleted graft. A T-cell clone was also detected in the peripheral blood before relapse in four cases.

Design and method: A total of 126 HD patients (74m 52w; average age 61.5+/-15.8) were enrolled. All patients were dialysed by European and KDIGO guidelines. ABPM (24-hours) was performed with SpaceLab 90207 after mid-week dialysis; pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) were measured using Arteriograph after mid-week dialysis. Malnutritioninflammation score (MIS) and protein energy wasting (PEW) score were calculated in all enrolled patients. There were 67.6% of patients without prior CV disease, and prior coronary heart disease, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were diagnosed in 7.1%, 5,6%, 4.7%, 8.7%, 3.9% patients, respectively. Prior diabetes and prior hypertension were diagnosed in 26.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Result(s): There were 74.6% of non-dippers, while white coat hypertension and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 25.4% and 7.9%, respectively. During the follow up period of 48 months 69 patients died from all-cause and 53 from CV mortality. Diurnal variations of blood pressure were not associated with all-cause mortality. Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology.

499,"The Impact of Radiation Dose and Fractionation on Outcomes for Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer Purpose: To review the treatment outcomes of limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) patients and to compare the outcomes among three groups in which the total radiation doses were 45 Gy with accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF), <54 Gy with standard fractionation (SF), and >=54 Gy with SF. Methods and Materials: LS-SCLC patients that had been treated with chemoradiotherapy between 1997 and 2007 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital were reviewed in this study. Of the 127 eligible patients, there were 37 patients in the AHF group, 29 in the SF <54 Gy group, and 61 in the SF >=54 Gy group. Result(s): Fifty-five patients (43%) were alive at the time of this analysis, and the median follow-up time of the surviving patients was 33 months. The median survival times were 30.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.3-43.7) for the AHF group, 14.0 months (CI 6.6-21.4) for the SF <54 Gy group, and 41.0 months (CI 33.9-48.1) for the SF >= 54 Gy group. As for the local control rates, and the overall and progression-free survival rates, all outcomes were significantly lower in the SF <54 Gy group than in the other two groups, although no significant difference was found between the AHF and SF >=54 Gy groups.

The extent to which host characteristics, including pigmentary phenotype and UV radiation exposure, contribute is unknown., Objective: To identify and validate independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT, including those associated with the transplant and the host., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed a consecutive sample of alloHCT recipients from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (n = 872) and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (n = 147). Participants from the Mayo Clinic were randomly allocated (2:1) into discovery (n = 581) and validation (n = 291) cohorts. Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P <= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Data were analyzed from March 13, 2018, to June 12, 2019., Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to development of the first cutaneous keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT; secondary outcome, time to development of the first individual basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma after alloHCT., Results: Of the 872 alloHCT recipients identified in the Mayo Clinic cohort (520 men [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.3 [12.6] years), 95 (10.9%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT during 5349 person-years of follow-up. Of the 147 alloHCT recipients in the exernal validation cohort (86 men [58.5%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 18 (12.2%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT in 880 person-years of follow up. Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91).

These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",Excluded

Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.

247,"[The short term therapeutic effects of radioactive (125)I seeds implantation for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer] OBJECTIVE: To explore influential factors of local therapeutic effect in CT guided brachytherapy of (125)I seeds for non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)., METHODS: Totally 141 primary NSCLC patients diagnosed by bronchoscope or puncture biopsy were treated with CT guided (125)I seeds implantation treatment from 2003 January to 2005 January. Among them, 26 patients were treated with seeds implantation only and remaining 115 combined with chemical therapy. Preplans were performed by using treatment planning system before the implantation. We took the implantation with the prescription dose of 80 - 110 Gy, 1 seed per 1 cm(3), under the guide of computed tomography. Six months after implantation treatment, CT graphs were taken to evaluate the therapeutic effect., RESULTS: All the patients were survival until 6 months after implantation, and 37 were complete remission, 93 were partial remissions. The effective rate was 92.2%. Among all the observed factors, pathologic type(F = 5.162, P = 0.023), dose of cover 100% tumor (D(100)) (F = 100.713, P = 0.000) and treatment methods (F = 16.205, P = 0.000) were the independent influent factors (P < 0.05). Among these, D(100) was the most important factor (P = 0.000). Single factor analysis indicated that pathologic type (chi(2) = 7.313, P = 0.007), D(100) (chi(2) = 71.6, P = 0.000) and treatment methods (chi(2) = 20.5, P = 0.000) were significant influent factors. Of all 141 cases, 24 had complications during or after implantation treatment, while no severe complications were reported. There was no significant correlation between complication and local therapeutic effect (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: CT guided implantation of (125)I seeds for lung cancer has good clinical effects and few complications. D(100) is the most important factor to influence the local therapeutic effect. Implantation treatment combined with chemotherapy is an ideal measure for NSCLC treatment.",Excluded
873,"Experiences of xerostomia after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A qualitative study AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions. The healthcare system requires a symptom management platform for radiation-induced complications, to help patients, their families and healthcare professionals obtain information about self-care, treatments and relief strategies.

1041,"Effect of gamma radiation on the biology of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma. I. Following larval exposure One and seven days old larvae of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma were exposed to doses ranging from 1-90 Gy. Lower doses ranging from 1-9 Gy applied to young larvae accelerate larval development whereas old larvae responded to doses from 10-90 Gy by a remarkable retardation of the larval and pupal development. Reduction in percentage pupation and adult emergence were noticed with increment in the radiation doses applied. This reduction was higher for irradiated seven days old larvae than the one day old larvae at all doses applied, indicating that young larvae were more susceptible to gamma radiation than the older one. At higher doses (30-70 Gy) the pupae could not continue their development and died within 17 days after pupation. The longevity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was decreased by increasing the radiation dosage and it was found that adults emerging from irradiated young larvae lived shorter than those from irradiated young ones, the fecundity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was also decreased by gamma irradiation exposures. The percentage reduction of larviposition was 100% for irradiated females with 8 Gy while that of irradiated males was 97.5% indicating that females were more sensitive to radiation than males.",Excluded
1096,"Functional changes cardiovascular: normobaric activity and microgravity in young healthy human subjects BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular system works to maintain homeostasis through a series of adaptive responses to physiological requirements. Different self-regulatory mechanism prevent the effects induced by hydrostatic pressure changes on oncotic pressure caused by postural changes. Gravity exerts a strong influence on the postural changes with implications on the cardiovascular system. In orbit, gravity (+Gz) is responsible of mass redistribution of circulating blood flow. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the adaptive responses of cardiovascular system to postural changes with and without the use of the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP). We considered that pressure changes that occur in human body in orbit can be simulated experimentally with use of Tilt-Test (Clino/ortho; Clino/head-down; head-down/ortho). This investigation could be useful for studying the influence on astronauts of long flights., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied in 12 months, 30 young healthy volunteers (20 males, 10 female) during postural change tests. In the first evaluation they were submitted to tilt-test for 40 minutes, remaining in head-up +60 degrees (this state corresponds to a kind of gravitational stress +Gz) and in head-down to -30 degrees (-Gz) for 20 minutes. During the second assessment (after 5 +/- 1 days) all volunteers wear a device that simulate a state of LBNP at -20 mmHg. Afterwards, they were processed to 20 minutes in Head Down -8 degrees and after 2 hours of rest to 20 minutes at -15 degrees. Volunteers were monitored measuring blood pressure, heart rate and by Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)., RESULTS: Collected data were elaborated by a statistical analysis. We observed during orthostatic position for 40 min (+60 degrees) without LBNP, lower diameters and volumes of left and right ventricular (p < 0.05) and an increase in heart rate in comparison with the baseline conditions in clinostatism. Despite the reduction of preload volume, the mean value of cardiac output does not vary significantly. In Trendelemburg (-15 degrees) data show a non-significant variation (p > 0.05) of left and right ventricular diameters and volumes, while cardiac output and systolic blood pressure varies significantly (p < 0.05) compared to clinostatic and orthostatic position. With LBNP in head down to -8 degrees and -15 degrees, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, ventricular volumes and cardiac output were unchanged if compared to values obtained in clinostatism with and without LBNP. If compared to -30 degrees in Trendelemburg without LBNP, data reached statistical significance (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular system and the autonomic nervous system, respond to postural changes and to volemia alterations, maintaining the physiological cardiac output, in order to preserve the metabolic requirements of body.",Excluded

Chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 7q, and 11p were also significantly more affected. Some bands also showed a special sensitivity to radiation, and band 1q32 was the most affected. This band is proposed as a hot point"" for the clastogenic effect of ionizing radiation. A significant clustering of breakpoints in G bands was also found, especially at the telomeres, as previously described by other authors. Clustering of breakpoints was also observed in bands where fragile sites, protooncogenes, breakpoints involved in chromosomal cancer rearrangements, and breakpoints involved in chromosomal evolution of the Hominoidea are located.""",Included
521,"Accelerated regrowth of non-small-cell lung tumours after induction chemotherapy Induction chemotherapy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage III with gemcitabine and cisplatin for downstaging of the tumour with the aim for further treatment with ionising radiation is one of the treatments for lung cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the waiting time for radiotherapy, that is, the interval between induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy, on the rate of tumour growth for patients with NSCLC. Interval times between the end of induction chemotherapy and date of diagnostic CT, planning CT and first day of radiotherapy were determined for 23 patients with NSCLC. Increase in gross tumour volume was measured for 18 patients by measuring the dimensions of the primary tumour and lymph node metastases on the diagnostic CT after induction chemotherapy and on the CT used for radiotherapy planning. For each patient, the volume doubling time was calculated from the time interval between the two CTs and ratio of the gross volumes on planning CT and diagnostic CT. The mean time interval between end of chemotherapy and day of diagnostic CT was 16 days, and till first day of radiotherapy 80.3 (range 29-141) days. In all, 41% of potentially curable patients became incurable in the waiting period. The ratio of gross tumour volumes of the two CTs ranged from 1.1 to 81.8 and the tumour doubling times ranged from 8.3 to 171 days, with a mean value of 46 days and median value of 29 days. This is far less than the mean doubling time of NSCLC in untreated patients found in the literature. This study shows that in the time interval between the end of induction chemotherapy and the start of radiotherapy rapid tumour progression occurs as a result of accelerated tumour cell proliferation: mean tumour doubling times are much shorter than those in not treated tumours. As a consequence, the gain obtained with induction chemotherapy with regard to volume reduction was lost in the waiting time for radiotherapy. We recommend diminishing the time interval between chemo- and radiotherapy to as short as possible.",Excluded
1015,"Rationale and design of the NO-PARTY trial: Near-zero fluoroscopic exposure during catheter ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias in young patients Introduction Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the mainstay of therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Conventional radiofrequency catheter ablation requires the use of fluoroscopy, thus exposing patients to ionising radiation. The feasibility and safety of non-fluoroscopic radiofrequency catheter ablation has been recently reported in a wide range of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias using the EnSite NavXTM mapping system. The NO-PARTY is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system results in a clinically significant reduction in exposure to ionising radiation compared with conventional catheter ablation. Methods The study will randomise 210 patients undergoing catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias to either a conventional ablation technique or one guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system. The primary end-point is the reduction of the radiation dose to the patient. Secondary end-points include procedural success, reduction of the radiation dose to the operator, and a cost-effectiveness analysis. In a subgroup of patients, we will also evaluate the radiobiological effectiveness of dose reduction by assessing acute chromosomal DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Conclusions NO-PARTY will determine whether radiofrequency catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system is a suitable and cost-effective approach to achieve a clinically significant reduction in ionising radiation exposure for both patient and operator. © Copyright 2012 Cambridge University Press.",Excluded
905,"Weight Loss After RYGB Is Associated with an Increase in Serum Vitamin D in a Population with Low Prevalence of Hypovitaminosis D at Low Latitude PURPOSE: In Brazil and worldwide, few studies have investigated vitamin D deficiency in patients with severe obesity who underwent bariatric surgery associated with latitude and level of solar radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the predictive factors of serum level changes after 12 months of RYGB in a low latitude region., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 50 patients from a low-latitude city (10degree 10' 8 S) in the north of Brazil. We collected data before surgery and after 3 and 12 months of surgery. The level of vitamin D was classified as deficiency (< 20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20-30 ng/ml), and sufficiency (>= 30 ng/ml)., RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 38.7 +/- 8.9 years, 69% were women, and percent excess weight loss (% EWL) was 83% after 1 year of surgery. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the preoperative period was 14%, and after 3 and 12 months of surgery, it decreased to 4% and 6%, respectively. The variation in vitamin D after 12 months of surgery was positively associated with changes in BMI, body fat, and % EWL., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is low in patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the northern region of Brazil, which is possibly related to low latitude. Weight loss was positively associated with an increase in serum vitamin D after surgery.",Excluded

Cytological examinations of these cases with regard to the vaginal epithelium had the following results: Group I:6 times; group II: 37 times; group IIW:8 times; group IIId: once; group IVa:twice. The cytological tests were carried out according to the method of papanicolaou as modified by Soost. Furthermore, we could state the following degrees of purity: Degree I: 8 times; degree II:16 times; degree III: 30 times. The cytological examinations of the urethral epithelium demonstrated, in 52 cases, an increased appearance of nude"" completely exposed epithelial cell nuclei--a fact corresponding to a degenerative autolysis (according to Wied). In the 26 women with missing atypical germ flora within the region of the exterior genitals, exclusively groups I (according to Papanicolaou and Soost) and degrees of purity I were stated. These persons also demonstrated remarkably grave psychical disturbances, especially in the intimate regions. In the cases of positive microbiological evidence, the following measures have proved satisfactory: Vaginal hygienization combined with a directly aimed antibacterial therapy, and the prescription of preparations containing lactic acid. A transitory discontinuation of contraceptives is being discussed. Our examination results are emphasizing the necessity of an analysis of the germ flora in cases of complaints arising from urethritis. Also psychical disturbances must be taken into consideration in cases of missing urological and gynaecological criteria of evidence.""",Excluded

496,"The role of vertebroplasty in lytic metastatic lesions: Preliminary report Introduction: Vertebrae with lytic metastasis have an high risk of burst fracture with neurologic complications. The gold standard for treatment of solitary metastases confined into the vertebral body is vertebrectomy. However many patients are not eligible for such an invasive procedure. Nevertheless, prevention of vertebral collapse plays a meaningful role in conserving and improving the quality of life in these patients. The prophylactic vertebroplasty may reduce pain and risk of fractures in metastatic vertebrae. The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of vertebroplasty for treatment of vertebral metastases. Method(s): In the last eighteen months we have treated ten patients with vertebral metastasis from larynx, breast, lung, kidney and uterus. Vertebral localizations were mainly at lumbar level and in few cased at dorso-lumbar level. The mean age of patients was 62.4 years. Our series included 8 women and 2 men. All the patients were studied with standard X-Ray projections both pre- and post surgery and at follow-up. TC scan, NMR and scintigraphy were performed in all patients pre-operatively whereas CT scan was routinely performed at 4 months after surgery. Clinical follow-up was performed using the VAS and the SF-36 scale. The procedure included a trans-pedicular bony biopsy followed by Vessel-X Vertebroplasty. Result(s): Cement leakage was detected into the inter-vertebral disc and in the vertebral venous system in 2 cases. Nevertheless there were no cases of pulmonary embolism or neurologic complications after the procedure. Trans-pedicular biopsy could confirm presence of neoplastic tissue in seven patients. Low back pain was significantly decreased at the VAS scale 1 month after surgery. Such an improvement remained stable at 4 months follow-up. No fracture of the vertebral body nor local progression of disease were detected at CT-scan at 4 month follow-up. Conclusion(s): The treatment of metastatic spinal tumours with modified Vessel-X vertebroplasty came out to be a safe and repeatable treatment. Injection of bone-cement into the anterior column with integrity of the posterior column leads to a good stability to the vertebra. Our preliminary data confirm the usefullness of this procedure in preventing vertebral body fracture and relieving pain at an average follow-up of 4 months. It is not possible by now to completely estimate the role of the vertebroplasty in controlling the neoplastic progression in the vertebral body, due to the small number of cases in our series.",Excluded
1179,"Radical chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy is becoming an alternative to radical cystectomy among patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle. In 1988, the authors began a protocol with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC regimen) and radiotherapy for these patients. Traditionally, age has been considered a determinant factor thereby excluding the older patients from the oncologic protocols that are considered to be more aggressive. The authors analyzed 20 patients (age > 70 years) who were treated during this period with the same protocol as the authors' other patients., METHODS: The study included 20 patients (age range, 70-78 years; median age, 74 years) including 4 patients with T2 disease, 9 with T3 disease, and 7 with T4 disease. All patients had a Karnofsky performance status of > 60. Treatment protocol included cytoreductive transurethral resection, 2 cycles of M-VAC chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (45 grays [Gy] on pelvic volume) with concurrent cisplatin (20 mg/m2 on Days 1-5. Response was determined by cystoscopic evaluation. If there was a complete response, radiotherapy continued until a total dose of 65 Gy; if there was not a complete response, cystectomy was performed., RESULTS: Tumor response after a dose of 45 Gy included 11 complete responses (55%), 5 partial responses (25%), and 4 nonresponses (20%). Overall survival was 75%, 34%, and 27% in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th years of follow-up, respectively. Cause specific survival was 79%, 54%, and 38%, respectively. Survival for patients with complete response was 100%, 60%, and 48%, respectively. Severe toxicity was uncommon, with the most frequent toxicities being leukopenia and cystitis. No treatment-related death occurred with either treatment protocol., CONCLUSIONS: The age of the individual must not become a strict exclusion criterion for the radical treatment of old patients with invasive bladder carcinoma.",Excluded
93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
1046,"The impact of different computational assumptions in 131I dosimetry for hyperthyroidism therapy Purpose: The goal of the current study was to investigate the impact of different computational models on 131I dosimetry prior to hyperthyroidism therapy. It was also aimed to highlight an accurate and cost-effective method for routine dosimetry of graves and toxic adenoma patients. Method(s): A cohort of 45 patients was recruited in the current study with Graves (n = 30) and Toxic Adenoma (n = 15) diseases. The eligibility criterion was determined using the patients' blood test, 99mTc- pertechnetate scintigraphy, and ultrasound scan. A properly calibrated thyroid probe equipped with sodium iodide crystal [NaI(Tl)] was used to obtain the uptake measurements at 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following administration of 0.27-0.73 MBq 131I tracer. The absorbed radiation dose of the thyroid gland/nodule was calculated by three different methods. The calculation models were based on the time-integrated activity (recommended by MIRD), effective half-life (recommended by EANM), and ellipsoidal-shape assumption. Result(s): The mean effective half-life was 138 +/- 41 h and 110 +/- 48 h in Graves and Toxic Adenoma patients, respectively. The mean residence time was 125 +/- 5 h in Graves patients, while it was 93 +/- 55 h in Toxic Adenoma. The amount of 131I activity required to deliver 200 Gy to the thyroid gland in Graves patients was calculated as 436 +/- 381 MBq, 426 +/- 370 MBq, and 488 +/- 455 MBq according to MIRD, EANM, and ellipsoidal-shape model, respectively. However, the activity required to impart 300 Gy in the toxic nodules was computed as 622 +/- 332 MBq by MIRD, 907 +/- 588 MBq by EANM, and 1060 +/- 639 MBq by the ellipsoidal-shape model. Overall, no significant difference was found between the MIRD and both of the EANM and ellipsoidal-shape models in the Graves patients (R2 = 0.99, P > 0.05). In contrast, less agreement (R2 = 0.86) was shown between EANM and MIRD in Toxic Adenoma patients with no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05), while the difference was significant (Pvalue < 0.05) between the MIRD and the ellipsoidal-shape model with moderate association (R2 = 0.66). Conclusion(s): It was deduced that the effective half-life-based model (EANM model) is a successful and affordable method for performing dosimetry in Graves patients. While, unit density sphere model sounds the most appropriate approach to be used in Toxic Adenoma dosimetry. However, using the ellipsoidal-shape assumption in the thyroid gland/or nodule dose calculation leads to redundantly larger activity administration.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",Excluded

The control group for the negative control group were given only saline. The experimental group was divided into two groups the irradiaton group and cyclophosphamide group. 3 subgroups (R1 R2 R3) in the irradiation group, were given 6Gy, 8Gy, 10Gy irradiation by electron accelerator respectively. Cyclophosphamide group were treated with cyclophosphamide for immunosuppressive treatment. Each group were implanted with tumor cell suspension. Observe the survival of tree shrew and tumor situation to select the best experimental conditions for Tree shrew lung cancer model. Result(s): 1. The immune suppressed tree shrews which treated by Electron accelerator radiation processing were activities reduced, slow, inactive, eating less, and even antifeedant. After tree shrews inoculated tumor cell suspension 2 days, the tumor growth can be seeing. Tumor was growth rapidly and tumor nodules became maximum at the 3rd week, after which tumor was growth slow and some nodules were narrowing.

Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded

850,"Optimal dose of contrast medium for depiction of hypervascular HCC on dynamic MDCT Purpose: The purpose of this study is to prospectively investigate the optimal dose of contrast medium for the depiction of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during the hepatic arterial phase (HAP), portal venous phase (PVP) and delayed phase (DP) of dynamic MDCT. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 128 patients, out of these patients, 36 patients were found to have 56 hypervascular HCCs. Sixty-three patients were assigned to receive a dose of 525 mgI/kg with protocol A, and 62 received a dose of 630 mgI/kg with protocol B. Measurements of the attenuation values of the abdominal aorta, portal vein, hepatic vein, hepatic parenchyma and HCC during the HAP, PVP and DP were taken. Tumor-liver contrast (TLC) was calculated from the attenuation value of the hepatic parenchyma and HCC. Result(s): The aortic attenuation value with protocol B (351, 166, and 132 HU) was significantly higher than that with protocol A (313, 153, and 120 HU) during all the phases, (P < 0.01 for all phases). The hepatic enhancement from unenhanced baseline with protocol B (25.2, 63.6, 50.6 HU) was significantly higher than that with protocol A (20.2, 55.1 and 43.0 HU) during all the phases, (P < 0.01 for all phases). The TLC with protocol B (37.4, -11.8 and -13.6 HU) was significantly higher than that with protocol A (28.0, -9.8 and -12.1 HU) during HAP (P = 0.042). Conclusion(s): The administration of 630 mgI/kg of body weight depicts hypervascular HCC more clearly during HAP and shows sufficient hepatic enhancement of 50 HU during DP. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

444,"A comparison of thoracic CT and abdominal CT for the identification of thoracic blunt trauma BACKGROUND: In light of current trends to limit radiation exposure and costs, as well as increased traffic safety, computed tomography (CT) may have decreasing value for evaluating patients with blunt trauma. The authors examined the utility of chest x-ray and abdominal CT for identifying clinically significant thoracic blunt trauma., METHODS: In this prospective study, findings on thoracic CT, abdominal CT, and chest x-ray from trauma patients were compared to assess injury prevalence and relevance to treatment outcomes., RESULTS: Four hundred forty-four patients were identified, of whom 76% had no findings. Occult findings had significantly lower Injury Severity Scores. All clinically relevant pneumothoraces and most other injuries could be identified without thoracic CT. Two of 3 aortic abnormalities were suspected from chest x-ray., CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant injuries can be identified with abdominal CT and chest x-ray, safely allowing reductions in radiation exposure, hospital stays, and costs by limiting the use of thoracic CT.

924,"UV dose determines key characteristics of nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers worldwide. Although many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NMSC, UV radiation is an important risk factor. A fundamental question in skin cancer research is whether varying doses of total UV radiation influence key characteristics of NMSC. The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded
852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
882,"Mild toxicity and favorable prognosis of high-dose and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma Purpose: The value of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma has not been previously reported. The aim of the present study was to assess the dosimetric parameters, toxicity, and treatment outcomes of patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Between 2003 and 2008, 42 patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma underwent definitive high-dose and extended involved-field IMRT with or without combination chemotherapy. The median radiation dose to the primary tumor was 50 Gy. The dose-volume histograms of the target volume and critical normal structures were evaluated in all patients. The locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The average mean dose delivered to the planning target volume was 55.5 Gy. Only 1.3% and 2.5% of the planning target volume received <90% and 95% of the prescribed dose, respectively, indicating excellent planning target volume coverage. The mean dose and average dose to the parotid glands was 15 Gy and 14 Gy, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 27 months, the 2-year locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survivalrate was 93%, 78%, and 74%, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 acute or late toxicity was reported. Conclusion(s): High-dose and extended involved-field IMRT for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma showed favorable locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival, with mild toxicity. The dose constraints of IMRT for the parotid glands can be limited to <20 Gy in these patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
466,"The association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and bone mineral density in the general population: The HUNT Study Background: Psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Longitudinal evidence is limited and this is yet to be examined among community-dwelling adults with anxiety. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between anxiety and depressive symptoms and BMD. Method(s): This study examined data from the second Nord-Trondelag Health Study (1995-1997; 1194 men and 7842 women) and a follow-up conducted in 2001 (697 men and 2751 women). Symptomatology was ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and BMD was measured at the forearm using single-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on medication use and lifestyle was self-reported, and these, together with anthropometric measures were tested in multivariate analyses. Result(s): In men, adjusted BMD was 2.6% lower at the ultradistal forearm for those with depressive symptoms and 2.6% lower at the ultradistal and 2.0% lower at the distal forearm for those with anxiety symptoms. In women, adjusted BMD at the distal and ultradistal forearm was lower for heavier women with depressive symptoms but this relationship diminished with decreasing weight. Forearm BMD was similar for women with or without anxiety symptoms. Longitudinally, neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms were associated with bone loss over 4.6 years. Limitation(s): Findings cannot be generalised to other skeletal sites and a longer follow-up period may be necessary to detect differences in bone loss. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms are cross-sectionally associated with reduced BMD. These findings provide further evidence to support monitoring BMD in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric illness. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
446,"Induction of complete wound healing in recalcitrant ulcers by low-intensity laser irradiation depends on ulcer cause and size Chronic skin ulcers still represent a therapeutic challenge in dermatology. Among the various non-invasive treatment modalities used for the improvement of impaired wound healing, low-intensity laser irradiations are gaining an increasing body of interest. We used low-intensity laser irradiations delivered by a 30 mW helium-neon laser at an energy density of 30 J/cm2 three times weekly for the induction of wound healing in ulcers of diverse causes. Twenty patients with the same number of ulcers, which had previously been treated by conventional wound care for a median period of 34 weeks (range: 3-120 weeks) without any significant evidence of healing, were included in the study. Concerning the underlying disorders, patients were divided into four groups: diabetes, arterial insufficiency, radio damage and autoimmune vasculitis. In all ulcers, complete epithelization could be induced by laser therapy. No amputation or any other surgical intervention was necessary and no adverse effects of any kind were noted during low-intensity laser treatment. Regarding the different diagnoses, a statistically significant difference was noted (P = 0.008): ulcers due to radio damage healed significantly faster than those caused by diabetes (6 weeks [range: 3-10 weeks] vs. 16 weeks [range: 9-45 weeks], P = 0.005). Wound healing in autoimmune vasculitis (24 weeks [range: 20-35 weeks]) required longer than in radiodermitis, although the difference was not significant. In addition to the diagnosis, wound size was found to be an important factor influencing the duration of wound closure (P = 0.028), whereas duration of previous conventional treatment (P = 0.24) and depth (P = 0.14) showed no effect. Our results indicate that low-intensity laser irradiation could be a valuable non-invasive tool for the induction of wound healing in recalcitrant ulcers, and that healing time is correlated with the ulcer cause and size.",Excluded
984,"Prognostic factors and prevention of radioembolization-induced liver disease UNLABELLED: Radioembolization (RE)-induced liver disease (REILD) has been defined as jaundice and ascites appearing 1 to 2 months after RE in the absence of tumor progression or bile duct occlusion. Our aims were to study the incidence of REILD in a large cohort of patients and the impact of a series of changes introduced in the processes of treatment design, activity calculation, and the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose steroids (modified protocol). Between 2003 and 2011, 260 patients with liver tumors treated by RE were studied (standard protocol: 75, modified protocol: 185). REILD appeared only in patients with cirrhosis or in noncirrhosis patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy prior to RE. Globally, the incidence of REILD was reduced in the modified protocol group from 22.7% to 5.4% and the incidence of severe REILD from 13.3% to 2.2% (P<0.0001). Treatment efficacy was not jeopardized since 3-month disease control rates were virtually identical in both groups (66.7% and 67.2%, P=0.93). Exposure to chemotherapy in the 2-month period following RE and being treated by the standard protocol were independent predictors of REILD among noncirrhosis patients. In cirrhosis, the presence of a small liver (total volume<1.5 L), an abnormal bilirubin (>1.2 mg/dL), and treatment in a selective fashion were independently associated with REILD., CONCLUSION: REILD is an uncommon but relevant complication that appears when liver tissue primed by cirrhosis or prior and subsequent chemotherapy is exposed to the radiation delivered by radioactive microspheres. We designed a comprehensive treatment protocol that reduces the frequency and the severity of REILD. Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded
281,"Design planning target volumes (PTVs) in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may help to diminish radiation-induced normal tissue damage and improve quality of life of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. However, highly conformal treatment techniques commonly establish steep dose gradients between tumor and normal tissues, therefore, daily setup variations can significantly compromise the ultimate precision of idealized IMRT delivery. This study was to investigate the setup accuracy of thermoplastic masks used for immobilizing NPC patients treated by simultaneous integrated boost IMRT, and to determine adequate margins to account for those uncertainties. METHOD(S):Nineteen patients with early stage (T1-2N0M0) NPC received CT scan weekly during their 6-week treatment course of fractionated IMRT. A total of 85 scanning parameters were obtained. The differences in anatomic landmark coordinates in 3-dimensional directions between daily setup and the first day setup were calculated through comparing the CT images with Osiris software. RESULT(S):Mean target isocenter translation was (0.89+/-0.69) mm in x-direction, (0.82+/-0.79) mm in y-direction, and (0.95+/-1.24) mm in z-direction. The systematic errors were 0.94 mm, 1.00 mm, and 1.32 mm. The random errors were 0.87 mm, 0.80 mm, and 1.04 mm. The mean total magnitude vector of isocenter motion was 1.87 mm; the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 2.03-7.24 mm. CONCLUSION(S): During IMRT for early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma, setting appropriate margin of planning target volume (PTV) by widening 3 mm from clinical target volume (CTV) in x, y, z directions will be sufficient to compensate for the dosimetric uncertainty of target areas due to patient setup error. The measured data in the present study should enable the user of this kind of thermoplastic mask to assign appropriate margins for the generation of planning target volumes (PTVs).",Excluded
302,"Feasibility of sentinel node biopsy in head and neck melanoma using a hybrid radioactive and fluorescent tracer Purpose. This study was designed to examine the feasibility of combining lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative sentinel node identification in patients with head and neck melanoma by using a hybrid protein colloid that is both radioactive and fluorescent. Methods. Eleven patients scheduled for sentinel node biopsy in the head and neck region were studied. Approximately 5 h before surgery, the hybrid nanocolloid labeled with indocyanine green (ICG) and technetium-99m (99mTc) was injected intradermally in four deposits around the scar of the primary melanoma excision. Subsequent lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) were performed to identify the sentinel nodes preoperatively. In the operating room, patent blue dye was injected in 7 of the 11 patients. Intraoperatively, sentinel nodes were acoustically localized with a gamma ray detection probe and visualized by using patent blue dye and/or fluorescencebased tracing with a dedicated near-infrared light camera. A portable gamma camera was used before and after sentinel node excision to confirm excision of all sentinel nodes. Results. A total of 27 sentinel nodes were preoperatively identified on the lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT images. All sentinel nodes could be localized intraoperatively. In the seven patients in whom blue dye was used, 43% of the sentinel nodes stained blue, whereas all were fluorescent. The portable gamma camera identified additional sentinel nodes in two patients. Ex vivo, all radioactive lymph nodes were fluorescent and vice versa, indicating the stability of the hybrid tracer. Conclusions. ICG-99mTc- nanocolloid allows for preoperative sentinel node visualization and concomitant intraoperative radio- and fluorescence guidance to the same sentinel nodes in head and neck melanoma patients. © 2012 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
230,"Diffusion tensor imaging in the assessment of normal-appearing brain tissue damage in relapsing neuromyelitis optica BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) damage was established in multiple sclerosis by histology, MR spectroscopy, magnetization transfer imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, whether this phenomenon can be detected in relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to use DTI to investigate the presence of NABT damage in RNMO patients and its possible mechanism.
METHODS: Conventional MR imaging and DTI scans were performed in 16 patients with RNMO without visible lesions on brain MR imaging and in 16 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects. Histogram analysis of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed in the entire brain tissue (BT), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM). Region of interest (ROI) analysis of MD and FA was also performed in WM regions connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve (including medulla oblongata, cerebral peduncle, internal capsule, and optic radiation), in corpus callosum without direct connection with them, and in some GM regions.
RESULTS: From histogram analysis, we found the RNMO group had a higher average MD of the BT, WM, and GM, a lower average MD peak height and a higher average MD peak location of the GM, and a higher average FA peak height of the WM than did the control group. From ROI analysis, compared with control subjects, RNMO patients had a higher average MD and a lower average FA in ROIs of WM connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve and a normal average MD and FA in corpus callosum without direct connection with them. In addition, a high average MD was found in parietal GM in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal diffusion in brain tissue in patients with RNMO and suggest that secondary degeneration caused by lesions in the spinal cord and optic nerve might be an important mechanism for this abnormality.",Excluded

Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is frequently recommended to improve survival outcome. The effect of PORT-associated morbidity on patients' quality of life (QOL) is, however, not well established. This study assessed the effect of PORT on medium-term (ie, at 6 months) QOL in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Head and Neck 35 (QLQ-HN35) at initial presentation, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Baseline QOL scores were adjusted for using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results. Global health status (mean difference = 13.3; p =.042) and xerostomia (mean difference = 35.4; p =.003) were significantly worse at 6 months in patients who received PORT compared to those treated with surgery alone. Conclusion. The survival advantage needs to be balanced against increased treatment toxicity. PORT is associated with reduced global health status, increased xerostomia, and marginally increased levels of fatigue at 6 months posttreatment for oral cavity cancer. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
387,"18F-sodium fluoride pet bone scans Background Information: 18 F-fluoride is a bone seeking positron emitting tracer with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of osseous lesions, and in particular osteolytic lesions. It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Role of 18 F-NaF PET imaging in detection of malignant and benign osseous disease.

690,"Comparison of Machine Learning Optimal Classification Trees With the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma Decision Rules Importance: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the standard for the rapid diagnosis of intracranial injury, but it is costly and exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules for identifying children with minor head trauma who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) are widely used to triage CT imaging. Objective: To examine whether optimal classification trees (OCTs), which are novel machine-learning classifiers, improve on PECARN rules' predictive accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of prospective, publicly available data on emergency department visits for head trauma used by the PECARN group to develop their tool was conducted to derive OCT-based prediction rules for ciTBI in a development cohort and compare their predictive performance vs the PECARN rules in a validation cohort among children who were younger than 2 years and 2 years or older. Data on 42412 children with head trauma and without severely altered mental status who were examined between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, were gathered from 25 emergency departments in North America participating in PECARN. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2016, to December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was ciTBI, with predictive performance measured by estimating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the OCT and the PECARN rules. The OCT and PECARN rules' performance was compared by estimating ratios for each measure. Results: Of the 42412 children (15 996 [37.7%] girls) included in the analysis, 10718 were younger than 2 years (25.3%; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [0.6] months) and 31694 were 2 years or older (74.7%; age, 9.1 [4.9] years). Compared with PECARN rules, OCTs misclassified 0 vs 1 child with ciTBI in the younger and 10 vs 9 children with ciTBI in the older cohort, and correctly identified more children with very low risk of ciTBI in the younger (7605 vs 5701) and older (20 594 vs 18 134) cohorts. In the validation cohorts, compared with the PECARN rules, the OCTs had statistically significantly better specificity (in the younger cohort: 69.3%; 95% CI, 67.4%-71.2% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 50.8%-54.9%; in the older cohort: 65.6%; 95% CI, 64.5%-66.8% vs 57.6%; 95% CI, 56.4%-58.8%), positive predictive value (odds ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively), and positive likelihood ratio (risk ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio between the 2 sets of rules. Conclusions and Relevance: If implemented, OCTs may help reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans, without missing more patients with ciTBI than the PECARN rules.",Excluded
16,"Incident air kerma to absorbed organ dose conversion factors for breast and lung in PA thorax radiography: The effect of patient thickness and radiation quality Purpose Converting the measurable quantities to patient organ doses in projection radiography is usually based on a standard-sized patient model and a specific radiation quality, which are likely to differ from the real situation. Large inaccuracies can therefore be obtained in organ doses, because organ doses are dependent on the exposure parameters, exposure geometry and patient anatomy. In this study, the effect of radiation quality and patient thickness on the organ dose conversion factors were determined. Methods In this study, the posterior-anterior projection radiograph of the thorax was selected in order to determine the effect of radiation quality (tube voltages of 70-130 kV and total filtrations of 3 mmAl to 4 mmAl + 0.2 mmCu) and patient thickness (anterior-posterior thicknesses of 19.4-30.8 cm) on the breast and lung dose conversion factors. For this purpose, Monte Carlo simulation programs ImpactMC and PCXMC were used with computed tomography examination data of adult male and female patients and mathematical hermaphrodite phantoms, respectively. Results Compared to the reference beam quality and patient thickness, the relative variation range in organ dose conversion factors was up to 74% for different radiation qualities and 122% for different patient thicknesses. Conclusions Conversion factors should only be used with comprehensive understanding of the exposure conditions, considering the exposure parameters, exposure geometry and patient anatomy they are valid for. This study demonstrates that patient thickness-specific and radiation quality-specific conversion factors are needed in projection radiography.Copyright © 2016 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded

The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP)., RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001). Mean radiation dose and DAP were less for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (2.1 +/- 3.7 mGy versus 2.5 +/- 3.5 mGy, P = 0.04; 11.5 +/- 15.3 muGy-m(2) versus 13.5 +/- 17.3 muGy-m(2), P = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Both injection approaches resulted in nearly 100% rates of intra-articular needle placement, but the lateral mortise approach used approximately 40% less fluoroscopy time and delivered 15% lower radiation dose and DAP to the patient.",Excluded
212,"Detection of coronary artery stenoses by low-dose, prospectively ECG-triggered, high-pitch spiral coronary CT angiography Objectives: We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered high-pitch scan mode for coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), which allows an effective dose of less than 1 mSv. Background(s): Coronary CTA provides increasingly reliable image quality, but the associated radiation exposure can be high. Method(s): Seventy-five patients with suspected coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm were screened for participation. After exclusion of 25 patients for body weight >100 kg or failure to lower heart rate to <=60 beats/min, 50 patients were studied by prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral computed tomography (CT). Coronary CTA was performed using a dual-source CT system with 2 x 128 x 0.6-mm collimation, 0.28-s rotation time, a pitch of 3.4, 100-kVp tube voltage, and current of 320 mA. Data acquisition was prospectively triggered at 60% of the R-R interval and completed within 1 cardiac cycle. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of coronary artery stenoses <50% diameter stenosis was determined by comparison to invasive coronary angiography. Per-patient diagnostic performance was the primary form of analysis. Result(s): In all 50 patients (34 males, 59 +/- 12 years of age), imaging was successful. For the detection of 16 patients with at least 1 coronary artery stenosis, CT demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79% to 100%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI: 65% to 93%). The positive predictive value was 72% (95% CI: 49% to 89%) and the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI: 87% to 100%). Sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 88% to 100%) and specificity was 94% (95% CI: 89% to 97%) on a per-vessel basis. Per-segment sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 80% to 97%), and specificity was 98% (95% CI: 96% to 98%).

483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive.

257,"Typical and atypical radiological manifestations of renal oncocytoma Objectives: Asses the Radiologic findings [conventional X-ray, intravenous urography (IU.), ultrasonography and computerized tomography (CT)] of the renal oncocytomas and determine if there are characteristics that allow us to differentiate them from renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a retrospective study of eight patients diagnosed of renal oncocytoma, analyzing the characteristics found in the plain radiography and IVU, ultrasonography and CT without and with i.v. contrast. Result(s): The masses were well defined in seven cases and poorly defined in one, and were homogeneous on four occasions and heterogeneous on two. The remaining two were homogeneous, except for the presence of a central scar. Two lesions showed and aggressive biological behavior, coinciding with signs suggestive of malignancy from the radiological point of view. Conclusion(s): The fibrous scar is a typical but infrequent findings in renal oncocytoma that we can only detect by CT. It is not possible to differentiate it from aggressive lesions with imaging techniques, although orientative findings exist.",Excluded
263,"Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study of pilocarpine to salvage salivary gland function during radiotherapy of patients with head and neck cancer OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of pilocarpine given during radiotherapy for head-neck cancer to reduce xerostomia was assessed., STUDY DESIGN: 58 patients receiving 5000 cGy radiotherapy (RT) involving salivary glands bilaterally were selected at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada. Patients were randomly assigned to pilocarpine (5 mg, PILO, n=29) or placebo group (PLA, n=29). These drugs were taken 5 times daily during radiotherapy (first study phase) and 4 times daily for 5 weeks thereafter (second study phase). Saliva was collected and estimated for not stimulated and stimulated patients using the SAXON method., RESULTS: At the conclusion of the first phase, PILO patients reported a better global quality of life (P=.02) and less oral discomfort (P=.001) when compared to PLA. No significant difference was noted in the level of saliva, xerostomia, and other symptoms between patients in PILO and PLA. At the end of the second phase, a difference between groups was observed only for xerostomia and mucosal pain; both were significantly higher in PILO when compared to PLA (P <.05)., CONCLUSION: Pilocarpine 5mg given 5 times daily did not appear to improve the production of saliva and global quality of life assessments, nor to decrease the symptoms of xerostomia 5 weeks after completion of RT in patients who were taking pilocarpine post-RT. There was a slight improvement in the quality of life and a decrease in the level of discomfort noted only after the first study phase. The limitations of this study are discussed.",Excluded

From May 10, 2002, through October 14, 2005, 125 patients were randomly allocated in a double-blind fashion to receive octreotide (100 microg, administered subcutaneously on day 1, followed by depot octreotide, 20 mg, administered intramuscularly on days 2 and 29; n = 62) or to receive a placebo (n = 63)., RESULTS: Grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 diarrhea were observed in 18%, 31%, 31%, and 21% of patients in the octreotide arm, respectively, and in 25%, 32%, 22%, and 21% of patients in the placebo arm, respectively (P = .64). Grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 abdominal cramps were observed in 32%, 45%, 21%, and 2% of patients receiving octreotide, respectively, and in 51%, 24%, 21%, and 5% of patients receiving the placebo, respectively (P = .053). Some patient-reported symptoms were worse in the octreotide group, including nocturnal bowel movements (70% v 45%; P = .004), clustering of bowel movements (90% v 69%; P = .004), and bleeding with bowel movements (57% v 35%; P = .01)., CONCLUSION: As administered in this study, octreotide did not decrease diarrhea during pelvic radiation therapy. Some gastrointestinal symptoms were worse in patients treated with octreotide. Octreotide is not indicated for prevention of diarrhea during pelvic radiation therapy.",Excluded
1055,"Maximum temperature and solar radiation as predictors of bipolar patient admission in an emergency psychiatric ward Environmental variables can regulate behavior in healthy subjects. Recently, some authors investigated the role of meteorological variables in bipolar patients with an impact on both the onset and course of bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of meteorological variables and other indexes in bipolar hospitalized patients. We examined all patients admitted to the Psychiatric Inpatient Unit of San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano (Turin, Italy) from September 2013 to August 2015, collecting several socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Seven hundred and thirty patients were included. Compared to the day of admission of control individuals, patients with BD were admitted on a day that presented higher minimum, medium, and maximum temperature, higher maximum humidity, higher solar radiation, and higher hours of sunshine. After logistic regression analysis, admissions to the emergency psychiatric ward due to a primary diagnosis of BD were associated with maximum temperature and solar radiation. The current study provides a novel perspective on the question surrounding seasonal mood patterns in patients with BD. A greater awareness of all possible precipitating factors is needed to inform self-management and psycho-educational programs as well as to improve resilience regarding affective recurrences in the clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

808,"Safety and accuracy of spinal instrumentation surgery in a hybrid operating room with an intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography Although spinal instrumentation technique has undergone revolutionary progress over the past few decades, it may still carry significant surgery-related risks. The purpose of the present study was to assess the radiological accuracy of spinal screw instrumentation using a hybrid operating room (OR) and quantify the related radiation exposure. This retrospective study included 33 cases of complex spine fusion surgeries that were conducted using a hybrid OR with a flat panel detector (FPD) angiography system. Twelve cases (36.4%) were cervical, and 21 (63.6%) were thoracolumbar. The average number of spine fusion levels was 3 and 4.8, respectively, at the cervical and thoracolumbar spine levels. A FPD angiography system was used for intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to obtain multi-slice spine images. All operations were conducted under optimized radiation shielding. Entrance surface doses (ESDs) and exposure times were recorded in all cases. A total of 313 screws were placed. Satisfactory screw insertion could be achieved in all cases with safe screw placement in 97.4% and acceptable placement in 2.6%. None of the cases showed any significant anatomical violation by the screws. The radiation exposure to the patients was absolutely consistent with the desired ESD value, and that to the surgeons, under the annual dose limit. These results suggest that the hybrid OR with a FPD angiography system is helpful to achieve safe and precise spinal fusion surgery, especially in complex cases.",Excluded
389,"Role of FDG-PET/CT in assessment of gastric lymphoma AIM:18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG- PET/CT) is widely used for initial staging and follow-up in patients with malignant lymphoma. In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of FDG-PET/CT in staging gastric lymphoma. MATERIAL- METHODS: A total of 33 patients with histological diagnosis of gastric lymphoma were referred to our clinic and scanned with FDG-PET following standard procedures. 15 out of 33 were male and 18 female. The mean age was 52,8 +/-15,7 years (range 26-80 years). Histopathologic diagnosis of gastric lymphoma was detected generally by endoscopy and revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) (n:16), marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphomas) (n:5),and B cell high grade lymphomas(BCHGL) (n:12). RESULT(S): In 8 out of 33 patients the result of FDG-PET/CT was normal (5 patients had total/subtotal gastrectomy, 3 patients was MALT lymphoma). In 6 patients diffuse increased uptake in gastric wall, in 7 patients both gastric and supra-infradiaphragmatic nodal increased uptake, in 7 patients both gastric and infradiaphragmatic nodal increased uptake, in 2 patients both gastric and supradiaphragmatic nodal increased uptake. Out of 3 patients who were operated, 1 patient had infradiafragmatic lymphadenopathy, and 2 had supra-infradiafragmatik lymphadenopathy. FDG-PET/CT detected extranodal involvement in 15 patients. In our study, 3 patients with primary gastric MALT lymphoma had a negative FDG-PET/CT scan and 2 had low SUV. Thus, although the diagnostic value of FDG-PET/CT scans for primary gastric MALT lymphoma is less than that for DLBCL or, BCHGL, it might be a better imaging option than CT scans. Post treatment FDG-PET/CT was applied to 16 patients. 5 patients had progression and 11 had regression of gastric lymphoma after treatment. Among 8 patients who had normal result in previous FDG- PET/CT, progression was observed in 2. CONCLUSION(S): Whole-body FDG-PET/CT is highly sensitive in detecting gastric lesions and supra/infradiaphragmatic nodal and extranodal involvement, with the exception of primary gastric MALT lymphoma in which the FDG-PET/CT scan SUV value is low.",Excluded
1224,"Ultrasmall WS2 Quantum Dots with Visible Fluorescence for Protection of Cells and Animal Models from Radiation-Induced Damages Two-dimensional WS2 materials have attracted wide attention in condensed physics and materials science due to its unique geometric and electronic structures. Particularly, WS2 shows extraordinary catalytic activities when its size decreases to ultrasmall, which provides potential opportunities for medical applications. In this work, WS2 quantum dots with strong catalytic properties were used for in vitro and in vivo protection from ionizing radiation induced cell damages. WS2 quantum dots possess unique optical properties of blue photoluminescence emission and excitation-wavelength dependent emission profiles. In vitro studies showed that cell viability can be considerably improved and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be removed by WS2 quantum dots. In vivo studies showed WS2 quantum dots can effectively protect the hematopoietic system and DNA from damages caused by high-energy radiation through removing whole-body excessive ROS. Furthermore, WS2 quantum dots showed nearly 80% renal clearance within 24 h post injection and did not cause any obvious toxicities in up to 30 days after treatment.Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Excluded

153,"Survival and complications following Gamma Knife radiosurgery or enucleation for ocular melanoma: A 20-year experience Background We present our experience in treating ocular melanoma at theNational Centre for Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Sheffield, UK over the last 20 years. Method We analysed 170 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, recorded the evolution of visual acuity and complication rates, and compared their survival with 620 patients treated with eye enucleation. Different peripheral doses (using the 50% therapeutic isodose) were employed: 50-70 Gy for 24 patients, 45 Gy for 71 patients, 35 Gy for 62 patients. Findings There was no significant difference in survival between the 35-Gy, 45-Gy and 50- to 70-Gy groups when compared between themselves (p00.168) and with the enucleation group (p00.454). The 5-year survival rates were: 64% for 35 Gy, 62.71% for 45 Gy, 63.6% for 50-70 Gy and 65.2% for enucleated patients. Clinical variables influencing survival for radiosurgery patients were tumour volume (p00.014) and location (median 66.4 vs 37.36 months for juxtapapillary vs peripheral tumours, respectively; p00.001), while age and gender did not prove significant. Regarding complications, using 35 Gy led to more than a 50% decrease, when compared with the 45-Gy dose, in the incidence of cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Retinopathy, optic neuropathy and vitreous haemorrhage were not significantly influenced. Blindness decreased dramatically from 83.7% for 45 Gy to 31.4% for 35 Gy (p00.006), as well as postradiosurgery enucleation: 23.9% for 45 Gy vs 6.45% for 35 Gy (p00.018). Visual acuity, recorded up to 5 years postradiosurgery, was significantly better preserved for 35 Gy than for 45 Gy (p00.0003). Conclusions Using 35 Gy led to a dramatic decrease in complications, vision loss and salvage enucleation, while not compromising patient survival. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded

601,"Electromagnetic navigation diagnostic bronchoscopy in peripheral lung lesions BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) with biopsy under fluoroscopic guidance has enhanced the yield of flexible bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. However, the accuracy of ENB navigation suggests that the addition of fluoroscopy is redundant., OBJECTIVES: Data were prospectively collected to determine the yield of ENB without fluoroscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions., METHOD: ENB was performed via flexible bronchoscopy (superDimension/Bronchus system; superDimension Inc; Plymouth, MN). Biopsy specimens were obtained through the extended working channel after navigation. Fluoroscopy was not utilized, but post-transbronchial biopsy chest radiographs were obtained to exclude pneumothorax. The primary end point was diagnostic yield, and the secondary end points were navigation accuracy, procedure duration, and safety. Analysis by lobar distribution was also performed to assess performance in different lobes of the lung., RESULTS: Ninety-two peripheral lung lesions were biopsied in the 89 subjects. The diagnostic yield of ENB was 67%, which was independent of lesion size. Total procedure time ranged from 16.3 to 45.0 min (mean [+/- SD] procedure time, 26.9 +/- 6.5 min). The mean navigation error was 9 +/- 6 mm (range, 1 to 31 mm). There were two incidences of pneumothorax for which no intervention was required. When analyzed by lobar distribution, there was a trend toward a higher ENB yield in diagnosing lesions in the right middle lobe (88%)., CONCLUSIONS: ENB can be used as a stand-alone bronchoscopic technique without compromising diagnostic yield or increasing the risk of pneumothorax. This may result in sizable timesaving and avoids radiation exposure.",Excluded
590,"Upregulation of VEGF and FGF2 in normal rat brain after experimental intraoperative radiation therapy The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 in the irradiated brain was examined to test how a single high dose radiation, similar to that used for intraoperative radiation therapy given to the normal cerebrum, can affect the vascular endothelium. After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included
995,"Cancer incidence in professional flight crew and air traffic control officers: disentangling the effect of occupational versus lifestyle exposures Flight crew are occupationally exposed to several potentially carcinogenic hazards; however, previous investigations have been hampered by lack of information on lifestyle exposures. The authors identified, through the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority medical records, a cohort of 16,329 flight crew and 3,165 air traffic control officers (ATCOs) and assembled data on their occupational and lifestyle exposures. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer incidence in each occupation to that of the general population; internal analyses were conducted by fitting Cox regression models. All-cancer incidence was 20-29% lower in each occupation than in the general population, mainly due to a lower incidence of smoking-related cancers [SIR (95% CI) = 0.33 (0.27-0.38) and 0.42 (0.28-0.60) for flight crew and ATCOs, respectively], consistent with their much lower prevalence of smoking. Skin melanoma rates were increased in both flight crew (SIR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.45-2.38) and ATCOs (2.66; 1.55-4.25), with rates among the former increasing with increasing number of flight hours (p-trend = 0.02). However, internal analyses revealed no differences in skin melanoma rates between flight crew and ATCOs (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% CI = 0.37-1.66) and identified skin that burns easily when exposed to sunlight (p = 0.001) and sunbathing to get a tan (p = 0.07) as the strongest risk predictors of skin melanoma in both occupations. The similar site-specific cancer risks between the two occupational groups argue against risks among flight crew being driven by occupation-specific exposures. The skin melanoma excess reflects sun-related behaviour rather than cosmic radiation exposure. Copyright © 2012 UICC.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively. Of 58 benign nodules, 27 showed less than 25 HU wash-in, 14 showed persistent contrast enhancement without washout and with wash-in of 25 HU or greater, and 11 showed washout greater than 31 HU and wash-in of 25 HU or greater.

366,"A Pilot Study of Safer Radiation Dosage to the Heart and Its Subregions Background and Objectives: The real impact of ionizing radiation on the heart and poorer overall survival for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the safe dose constraints to the heart's subregions that could prevent patients' early non-cancerous death and improve their quality of life. Methods and Materials: A retrospective cohort study was performed containing 51 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and treated using 3D, Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy. For a dosimetric analysis, these structures were chosen: heart, heart base (HB), and region of great blood vessels (GBV). Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were recorded for all mentioned structures. Maximum and mean doses to the heart, HB, the muscle mass of the HB, and GBV were obtained. V10-V60 (%) parameters were calculated from the DVH. After performed statistical analysis, logistic regression models were created, and critical doses calculated. Result(s): The critical dose for developing a fatal endpoint for HB was 30.5 Gy, while for GBV, it was 46.3 Gy. Increasing the average dose to the HB or GBV by 1 Gy from the critical dose further increases the possibility of early death by 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We suggest that the non-canonical sub-regions of the heart (HB and GBV) should be considered during the planning stage. Additional constraints of the heart subregions should be chosen accordingly, and we propose that the mean doses to these regions be 30.5 Gy and 46.3 Gy, respectively, or less. Extrapolated DVH curves for both regions may be used during the planning stage with care.",Excluded

Graft hepatectomy is technically challenging and is associated with high morbidity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of primary HCC. However, its role in HCC recurrence in a liver graft remains unclear. AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of graft HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. From 2012 to 2018, 6 patients with intrahepatic HCC recurrence after liver transplant were treated with SBRT at Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong. The primary outcome was time to overall disease progression and secondary outcomes were time to local progression and best local response, as assessed with the Modified response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours criteria. Patients were monitored for treatment related toxicities and graft dysfunction. RESULTS A total of 9 treatment courses were given for 13 tumours. The median tumour size was 2.3 cm (range 0.7-3.6 cm). Two (22%) patients had inferior vena cava tumour thrombus. The best local treatment response was: 5 (55%) complete response, 1 (11%) partial response and 3 (33%) stable disease. After a median follow up duration of 15.5 mo, no local progression or mortality was yet observed. The median time to overall disease progression was 6.5 mo. There were 6 regional progression in the liver graft (67%) and 2 distant progression in the lung (22%). There was no grade 3 or above toxicity and there was no graft dysfunction after SBRT.

Method(s): Between 2003 and 2009, 41 patients with 50 lesions confined to one organ from colorectal cancer (CRC) and treated with high dose SBRT <=45 Gy were retrospectively reviewed. Lymph nodes (LNs) (18 patients) were the most frequent sites followed in order by lung (12) and liver (11). SBRT doses ranged from 45 to 60 Gy in three fractions (median 48 Gy). The cumulative gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 2 to 123 ml (median 13 ml). Result(s): The median follow-up period from the SBRT date was 28 months (range, 6-65 months). The 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 64 and 60%, and the respective 5-year rates were 57 and 38%. Cumulative GTV and SBRT dose were statistically significant prognostic factors for local control. The grade 3 or 4 complications occurred in three patients (7%). Conclusion(s): High dose SBRT for colorectal oligometastases was found to produce results comparable with surgical series. To improve local control, dose higher than 48 Gy are recommend when possible, but further study will be required to define the optimal normal tissue constraints and acceptable toxicity.

386,"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19 BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease., METHOD: Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically., RESULT: There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05).

Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence. The data obtained in this study indicate that a certain interval after surgery might improve therapy outcome.",Included
22,"Automated identification and grading of coronary artery stenoses with X-ray angiography BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) remains the gold standard imaging technique for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Automatic detection and grading of coronary stenoses in XCA are challenging problems due to the complex overlap of different background structures with intensity inhomogeneities. We present a new computerized image based method to accurately identify and quantify the stenosis severity on XCA., METHODS: A unified framework, consisting of Hessian-based vessel enhancement, level-set skeletonization, improved measure of match measurement, and local extremum identification, is developed to distinctly reveal the vessel structures and accurately determine the stenosis grades. The methodology was validated on 143 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic XCA through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations., RESULTS: The presented algorithm was tested on a set of 267 vessel segments annotated by two expert cardiologists. The experimental results show that the method can effectively localize and quantify the vessel stenoses, achieving average detection accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-score of 93.93%, 91.03%, 93.83%, 89.18%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: A fully automatic coronary analysis method is devised for vessel stenosis detection and grading in XCA. The presented approach can potentially serve as a generalized framework to handle different image modalities. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
651,"Integrated resistance and aerobic exercise protects fitness during bed rest INTRODUCTION: The current exercise countermeasures have not fully protected astronauts' preflight aerobic and muscular fitness levels during International Space Station (ISS) missions, prompting a need to optimize the exercise prescription to improve or maintain astronauts' ability to perform critical tasks and eventually extend the duration of missions., PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that an integrated resistance and aerobic exercise prescription performed with exercise equipment similar to that on the ISS can be tolerated and maintain cardiovascular and muscular fitness during 14 d of exposure to a model of microgravity., METHODS: Subjects (n = 9) participated in 14-21 d of pre-bed rest training and familiarization, 14 d of bed rest + iRAT exercise, and 7 d of ambulatory recovery. Peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak), ventilatory threshold (VT), and isokinetic and leg press tests were performed before and after bed rest to evaluate cardiovascular and muscle functions. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined before, during, and after bed rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., RESULTS: Improvements from before to after bed rest were observed in VO2peak (2.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), VT (1.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), leg muscle power (1582 +/- 317 to 1740 +/- 359 W), and muscle CSA of the grouped vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis muscles (67.5 +/- 8.4 to 68.9 +/- 8.3 cm). Muscle strength and total CSA of the upper and lower legs were not different from before to after bed rest., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of exercise being completely effective for the prevention of cardiovascular and skeletal muscle deconditioning during strict bed rest using exercise equipment similar to that on the ISS. This was accomplished with high subject compliance.",Excluded
736,"Synergic stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (GON) and sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) for the control of cluster headaches (CH) Introduction: CH is a form of primary unilateral headache that features repeated attacks of excruciating severe pain. Frequently unresponsive to medical management, it has attracted the interest for its resolution by means of ablative surgical techniques and neuromodulation. We present two patients suff ering from CH refractory to conservative treatment, who were subjected to chronic synergic stimulation of the occipital nerve and SPG with a three year follow up. Material(s) and Method(s): Two patients suff ering from CH, a 48 y/o female, and a 23 y/o male, both refractory to medical treatment, underwent surgery on February and March, 2008, respectively. In both cases we proceeded to the simultaneous implantation of SPG and greater occipital nerve stimulators. They were followed up using the VAS, HDRS, HARS, and SF-36 questionnaire, previous to the procedure, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the procedure, and subsequently every 6 months. The stimulation schedule was as follows: four months of SPG stimulation, four months of GON stimulation, and simultaneous stimulation. Result(s): The first patient experienced and excellent initial pain relief, presenting a sudden loss of stimulation of the facial area 12 days after surgery, noting electrode displacement from the SPG in control X-ray (picture 1), which required its relocation, with the subsequent regaining of the initial benefit. Both patients obtained the greatest response (in terms of pain relief) during the simultaneous stimulation of SPG and GON, which was superior to that one obtained with the independent stimulation of each structure. The female patient obtained a complete control with total disappearance of the crisis. Surprisingly, 15 month after the intervention she did not required utilizing the stimulation, situation that remains unchanged to date. The male patient obtained a pain reduction of 86% during the first three months of synergic stimulation according to the VAS, but he remained at 66% pain reduction thereafter. Also, the number of crisis decreased in a significant manner. Discussion(s): Multiple percutaneous techniques have been proposed to control CH symptoms, including the utilization of radiofrequency on the Gasser ganglion, GON and SPG, among other structures (1). With the advent of neuromodulation, deep hypothalamic stimulation demonstrated a high efficacy in the treatment of this condition (2), even though with some risks inherent to the procedure, including death. Conclusion(s): Synergic stimulation of the greater occipital nerve and SPG has demonstrated greater effectiveness in the control of the frequency and magnitude of painful crisis of CH in relation to single stimulation of each one of these structures. We believe this is a useful therapeutic strategy before considering deep hypothalamic stimulation due to its greater frequency of complications.",Excluded
892,"Initial experience using intensity-modulated radiotherapy for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose: To report our initial experience on the feasibility, toxicity, and tumor control using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for retreatment of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods and Materials: A total of 49 patients with locoregional recurrent carcinoma in the nasopharynx were treated with IMRT between January 2001 and February 2002 at the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China. The average time to the nasopharyngeal recurrence was 30.2 months after initial conventional RT. The median isocenter dose to the nasopharynx was 70 Gy (range 60.9-78.0) for the initial conventional RT. All patients were restaged at the time of recurrence according to the 1992 Fuzhou, China staging system on NPC. The number of patients with Stage I, II, III and IV disease was 4, 9, 10, and 26, respectively. T1, T2, T3, and T4 disease was found in 4, 9, 11, and 25 patients, respectively. N0, N1, N2, and N3 disease was found in 46, 2, 0, and 1 patient, respectively. Invasion of the nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, and cavernous sinus and erosion of the base of the skull was found in 8, 1, 3, 8, 15, and 20 patients, respectively. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Report 62 guidelines. The critical structures were contoured, and the doses to critical structures were constrained according to ICRU 50 guidelines. The GTV in the nasopharynx and positive lymph nodes in the neck received a prescription dose of 68-70 Gy and 60 Gy, respectively. All patients received full-course IMRT. Three patients who had positive lymph nodes were treated with five to six courses of chemotherapy (cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) after IMRT. Result(s): The treatment plans showed that the percentage of GTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose (V95-GTV) was 98.5%, and the dose encompassing 95% of GTV (D95-GTV) was 68.1 Gy in the nasopharynx. The mean dose to the GTV was 71.4 Gy. The average doses of the surrounding critical structures were much lower than the tolerable thresholds. At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 3-13), the locoregional control rate was 100%. Three cases (6.1%) of locoregional residual disease were seen at the completion of IMRT, but had achieved a complete response at follow-up. Three patients developed metastases at a distant site: two in the bone and one in the liver and lung at 13 months follow-up. Acute toxicity (skin, mucosa, and xerostomia) was acceptable according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Tumor necrosis was seen toward the end of IMRT in 14 patients (28.6%). Conclusion(s): The improvement in tumor target coverage and significant sparing of adjacent critical structures allow the feasibility of IMRT as a retreatment option for recurrent NPC after initial conventional RT. This is the first large series using IMRT to reirradiate local recurrent NPC after initial RT failed. The treatment-related toxicity profile was acceptable. The initial tumor response/local control was also very encouraging. In contrast to primary NPC, recurrent NPC reirradiated with high-dose IMRT led to the shedding of tumor necrotic tissue toward the end of RT. More patients and longer term follow-up are warranted to evaluate late toxicity and treatment outcome. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
429,"Evaluation of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D PET scanner in H2(15)O brain activation studies: dose fractionation strategies for rCBF and signal enhancing protocols We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
771,"Prospects of application of new photosensitizer Elophit"" in photodynamic therapy for treating some dermatologic diseases"" Purpose: Purpose of the present work was to study photosensitizer (PS) Elophit"" effectiveness for PDT sessions in some dermatologic diseases. Material(s) and Method(s): Gel ""Elophit"" is a complex substance containing chlorins E6 (0.5%), copper chlorophyllin (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (2%) (conformance certificate No. ROSS RU.IM; 25130 2322). Therapeutic effects are produced not only due to the chlorin E6 photodynamic (PDT) action but also due to the action of copper derivatives which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. The preparation easily penetrates into the skin and accumulates in inflammatory foci. Gel ""Elophit"" was put on skin lesions 40 min before PDT session. Before the session preparation remnants were removed off the skin with a mild alcohol solution. PDT was performed in 12 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form) (4 males, 8 females), 8 patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (5 males, 3 females). Controls were 24 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form), 20 patients with streptostaphylodermias. Age - 17-58 years old, disease duration from 1 week to 6 years. Patients from the control group received traditional therapy without PDT component. Device ""Soljaris"" with incorporated diodes in the range 660 mum, irradiation power 400 mW was used as a light source. Irradiation was done in a scan manner (70-270 J/cm2). Sessions - twice a week. Research results were assessed by changes in the clinical picture using biophometry techniques with laser therapeutic apparatus ""Milta F-8-01"" having an in-built biophotometer. These changes are shown in photomaterials. FS accumulation degree in the skin was determined with spectrometry (apparatus ""LESA-01-BIOSPEC""). Result(s): A complete rash regression after 4-8 PDT sessions (in 2 weeks - 1 month) was seen in 8 (66.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris, in 5 (62.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia; in the rest of patients a considerable clinical improvement was seen. No changes in clinical picture during PDT treatment was seen in 2 (16.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 1 (12.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia. In the controls one month later a clinical remission was seen in 10 (41.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 11 (55%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, no changes - in 7 (29.1%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 6 (30%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, in the rest of patients - a partial rash regression. A fluorescent examination has shown less FS fluorescence (by 60-75%) in the skin after irradiation what indicates a marked phodynamic effect with a considerable discharge of singlet oxygen. Clinical observations have been confirmed by the results of biophotometric examinations of skin lesions when one could see changes typical for decreased or resorpted inflammatory processes. Conclusion(s): Thus, as it has been shown by preliminary findings PDT with photosensitizer ""Elophit"" may be an effective technique for treating some dermatologic pathologies. Further researches are needed to study better effectiveness of PDT with gel ""Elophit"" application in dermatologic practice so as to determine indications and to develop optimal schemes for treatment.""",Excluded
857,"Late intravascular ultrasound findings of patients treated with brachytherapy for diffuse in-stent restenosis This study aimed at evaluating long-term (24-month) effects of beta-irradiation (188Re-MAG3-filled balloon) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). Long-term effects of beta-irradiation on intimal hyperplasia (IH) within the stented segment and vessel and lumen dimensions of nonstented adjacent segments in patients with ISR have not been sufficiently evaluated. Two-year follow-up IVUS was performed in 30 patients with patent ISR segments at 6-month follow-up angiography. Serial IVUS images were acquired at five equidistant intrastent sites and at three different reference segment sites. IH burden (%) was defined as 100 x (IH/stent area). Mean intrastent IH area and IH burden significantly increased between 6 and 24 months, from 2.1 +/- 1.1 to 2.6 +/-v 1.4 mm2 (P < 0.001) and from 26% +/- 10% to 33% +/- 14% (P < 0.001), respectively. There was a significant decrease of mean external elastic membrane (from 10.1 +/- 3.9 to 9.7 +/- 3.9 mm2; P = 0.015) and lumen area (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 5.1 +/- 2.3 mm2; P = 0.021) within distal reference segments between 6 and 24 months. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in six patients (20%) between 6 and 24 months after beta-irradiation therapy. There were no significant differences between TLR and non-TLR groups except for a smaller minimum lumen area at 24 months in the TLR group. Because of a small amount of late loss between 6 and 24 months, most irradiated ISR vessel segments remained stable for up to 2 years. However, quantitative evidence of late catch-up was evident in most patients and was significantly associated with 24-month TLR in some patients. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
899,"Pretreatment with a single, low dose of recombinant human thyrotropin allows dose reduction of radioiodine therapy in patients with nodular goiter In patients with nodular goiter, radioiodine ((131)I) therapy results in a mean reduction in thyroid volume (TV) of approximately 40% after 1 yr. We have demonstrated that pretreatment with a single, low dose of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) doubles 24-h radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) in these patients. We have now studied the safety and efficacy of therapy with a reduced dose of (131)I after pretreatment with rhTSH. Twenty-two patients with nodular goiter received (131)I therapy, 24 h after im administration of 0.01 (n = 12) or 0.03 (n = 10) mg rhTSH. In preceding diagnostic studies using tracer doses of (131)I, 24-h RAIU without and with rhTSH pretreatment (either 0.01 or 0.03 mg) were compared. Therapeutic doses of (131)I were adjusted to the rhTSH-induced increases in 24-h RAIU and were aimed at 100 micro Ci/g thyroid tissue retained at 24 h. Pretreatment with rhTSH allowed dose reduction of (131)I therapy by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.5 in the 0.01-mg and by a factor of 2.4 +/- 0.4 in the 0.03-mg rhTSH group (P < 0.05, 0.01 vs. 0.03 mg rhTSH). Before and 1 yr after therapy, TV and the smallest cross-sectional area of the tracheal lumen were measured with magnetic resonance imaging. During the year of follow-up, serum TSH, free T(4) (FT(4)), T(3), and TSH receptor antibodies were measured at regular intervals. TV before therapy was 143 +/- 54 ml in the 0.01-mg group and 103 +/- 44 ml in the 0.03-mg rhTSH group. One year after treatment, TV reduction was 35 +/- 14% (0.01 mg rhTSH) and 41 +/- 12% (0.03 mg rhTSH). In both groups, smallest cross-sectional area of the tracheal lumen increased significantly. In the 0.01-mg rhTSH group, serum FT(4) rose, after (131)I treatment, from 15.8 +/- 2.8 to 23.2 +/- 4.4 pM. In the 0.03-mg rhTSH group, serum FT(4) rose from 15.5 +/- 2.5 to 23.5 +/- 5.1 pM. Individual peak FT(4) levels, reached between 1 and 28 d after (131)I treatment, were above the normal range in 12 patients. TSH receptor antibodies were negative in all patients before therapy and became positive in 4 patients. Hyperthyroidism developed in 3 of these 4 patients between 23 and 25 wk after therapy. In conclusion, in patients with nodular goiter pretreatment with a single, low dose of rhTSH allowed approximately 50-60% reduction of the therapeutic dose of radioiodine without compromising the efficacy of TV reduction.",Excluded
866,"Bone Marrow Transplantation Induces Normoglycemia in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Murine Model Objective: To study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy, bone marrow-derived cells must be identified. The aim of this study was to obtain a diabetic chimeric model with bone marrow cells expressing enhanced green fluorecence protein (EGFP), without modifying the course of diabetic nephropathy. Material(s) and Method(s): Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in an obese type 2 diabetic murine model (db/db) owing to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene. Whole bone marrow from female donor C57BL/6 EGFP+ mice was transplanted into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and into 8- and 24-week-old female C57BLKS (db/db) EGFP- mice. Recipient mice received total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow (BM) cell infusion. We tested various irradiation doses (Gy) and numbers of BM cells. Result(s): When a low TBI dose and a small number of BM cells were administered, only syngeneic C57BL/6 mice became chimeric, whereas allogeneic db/db mice showed rejection. When Gy dose and BM cells were increased, db/db mice became chimeric. However, 8-week-old db/db mice lost the obese phenotype and became normoglycemic, probably due to peripheral BM cell infiltration. Conversely, 24-week-old db/db mice remained obese showing similar blood glucose values, body weights, albuminuria, and glomerular lesions at nontransplanted db/db mice. Conclusion(s): Recipient age greatly influenced the peripheral repopulation after BMT in db/db mice. Only the adult chimeric db/db mice seemed to be a good model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

534,"Post-remission treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukaemia: A time-dependent analysis Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. Method(s): For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. Finding(s): 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Interpretation(s): Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

86,"Influence of low-dose radiation on abscopal responses in patients receiving high-dose radiation and immunotherapy BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence suggests that low-dose radiation may overcome the inhibitory effects of the tumor stroma and improve a tumor's response to immunotherapy, when combined with high-dose radiation to another tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor responses to this combination in a clinical setting., METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of 3 ongoing immunoradiation trials was performed. Twenty-six (of 155) patients received low-dose radiation (1-20 Gy total), either as scatter from high-dose radiation or from intentional treatment of a second isocenter with low-dose radiation, were evaluated for response. The low-dose lesions were compared to lesions that received no radiation (< 1 Gy total). Response rates, both defined as complete and partial responses as defined by RECIST criteria were used to compare lesion types., RESULTS: The 26 patients had a total of 83 lesions for comparison (38 receiving low-dose, 45 receiving no-dose). The average dose given to low-dose lesions was 7.3 Gy (1.1-19.4 Gy), and the average time to response was 56 days. Twenty-two out of 38 (58%) low-dose lesions met the PR/CR criteria for RECIST compared with 8 out of 45 (18%) no-dose lesions (P = 0.0001). The median change for longest diameter size for low-dose lesions was - 38.5% compared to 8% in no-dose lesions (P < 0.0001). Among the low-dose lesions that had at least one no-dose lesion within the same patient as a control (33 and 45 lesions respectively), 12 low-dose lesions (36%) responded without a corresponding response in their no-dose lesions; Conversely, two (4%) of the no-dose lesions responded without a corresponding response in their low-dose lesion (P = 0.0004)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiation may increase systemic response rates of metastatic disease treated with high-dose radiation and immunotherapy.",Excluded

The image quality of urinary collecting system, the detection of urinary obstructive lesion, and radiation dose were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: Between the two imaging methods, the imaging quality of urinary system did not show significant difference, but radiation dose was statistically significant difference. The radiation dose of split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan was only 55% of traditional CTU scan., CONCLUSION: Split-bolus2 phase with virtual non-enhanced scan could obtain the same image quality as tranditional CTU, while reducing the approximately half the radiation dose.",Excluded
1100,"Non-coherent light sources in the blue range of the spectrum for treating streptostaphylodermias Purpose: To determine possibilities of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with non-coherent light sources in the blue range of the spectrum for treating streptostaphylodermias. Previously performed microbiological and spectrophotometric studies andexperimental work with animals have helped the author to choose photosensitisers and light sources for the present clinical trials. Material(s) and Method(s): PDT was done in 62-patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (28 men and-34 women) aged 17-58. In the control group there were 58 patients (27 men and 31 women) who had traditional therapy. In PDT treatment 1% gel of photosensitizer Photoditazin was applied at skin lesions one hour before irradiation. Light-emitting diode therapeutic apparatus ""AST"" (registration number FSR-2008/02720) generating light at the range 400-410nm (in the Sore band), power 500 mWt was used as a light source. 3 sessions a week, irradiation time 5-7 min at 5 cm distance. Results were assessed by changes in clinical picture, by biophotometric findings (with biophotometer ""Milta-08 1""). Changes were also fixed by a photocamera. Result(s): During the trial complete regression of skin rash was seen in 81% patients, considerable improvement in 27.5%; no changes in 11% after 4-8 PDT sessions (1.5-2.5 weeks after treatment beginning); in the control group 18%, 59% and 62%, correspondently.

420,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included
668,"Stage I-II non-small-cell lung cancer treated using either stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): outcomes of a propensity score-matched analysis BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) are both used for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. We carried out a propensity score-matched analysis to compare locoregional control (LRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: VATS lobectomy data from six hospitals were retrospectively accessed; SABR data were obtained from a single institution database. Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis found a superior LRC after SABR compared with VATS lobectomy, but OS did not differ. Our findings support the need to compare both treatments in a randomized, controlled trial.",Included
480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded
498,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

1066,"Prognostic factors and treatment outcomes of 100 cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma Background: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a malignancy with one of the highest fatality rates. Here we report a retrospective study of the treatment and other factors associated with its outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): The medical records of 100 patients diagnosed with ATC at Ito Hospital between 1993 and 2009 were reviewed and pertinent information was extracted and analyzed. Result(s): There were 80 women and 20 men, and their median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range, 41-90 years). Thirteen patients had a history of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Six patients had a small ATC focus within a differentiated carcinoma. All cases were retrospectively staged according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification system, and the results were stage IVA in 11 cases, stage IVB in 31 cases, and stage IVC in 58 cases. Seventy patients underwent surgical treatment, and complete resection was performed in 24 of them. Seventy-eight patients received radiotherapy, and 58 of them received a total dose of >=40 Gy. Twenty-seven patients received chemotherapy. Only 15 patients received multimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). The 1-year survival rates according to stage were as follows: stage IVA, 72.7%; stage IVB, 24.8%; and stage IVC, 8.2%. Multivariate analysis identified age >=70 years, white blood cell >=10,000 mm3, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis as prognostic factors. Survival after complete resection was significantly better than after incomplete resection or no resection. The results also suggested that radiation doses of >=40 Gy were associated with significantly longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although the prognosis of most patients with ATC continues to be poor, surgery, radiotherapy, and a combination of both improved the survival of patients with ATC. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
1107,"Gamma teletherapy of inoperable retroperitoneal tumors with nonuniform distribution of the dosage in the tissues The clinical material is used to substantiate the advantage of the technic of uneven irradiation of patients with primary locally spread tumors of the retroperitoneal space, in whom all the routinely used methods of treatment proved to be infective. Uneven distribution of the dosage is provided by using a grid diaphragm and conducting gamma-therapy only from one static field during the whole course of irradiation. This pattern of radiotherapy is shown to increase radioresistance of normal tissues and allows 1.5--4 times large focal dose to be applied to tumor compared with gamma-therapy via moving lead strips, thus rendering an enhanced antitumor effect of radiation. These data are confirmed by the results of clinical observations over 30 patients with locally spread inoperable tumors of the retroperitoneal space.",Excluded
1016,"Cost of treating diabetic foot ulcers in five different countries Most estimates in the literature for the economic cost of treating a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) are from industrialized countries. There is also marked heterogeneity between the complexity of cases considered in the different studies. The goal of the present article was to estimate treatment costs and costs to patients in five different countries (Chile, China, India, Tanzania, and the United States) for two hypothetical, but well-defined, DFUs at the extreme ends of the complexity spectrum. A co-author, who is a treating physician in the relevant country, was asked to choose treatment plans that represented the typical application of local resources to the DFU. The outcomes were pre-defined as complete healing in case 1 and trans-tibial amputation in case 2, but the time course of treatment was determined by each investigator in a manner that would be typical for their clinic. The costs, in local currencies, for each course of treatment were estimated with the assistance of local hospital administrators. Typical reimbursement scenarios in each country were used to estimate the cost burden to the patient, which was then expressed as a percentage of the annual per capita purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product. There were marked differences in the treatment plans between countries based on the availability of resources and the realities of local conditions. The costs of treatment for case 1 ranged from Int$102 to Int$3959 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost for case 2 ranged from Int$3060 to Int$188645 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost burden to the patient varied from the equivalent of 6days of average income in the United States for case 1 to 5.7years of average annual income for case 2 in India. Although these findings do not take cost-effectiveness into account, they highlight the dramatic economic burden of a DFU for patients in some countries. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
1172,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy vs conventionally fractionated chemoradiation in locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A multicenter case-control study (PAULA-1) Conventionally fractionated chemoradiation (CRT) or chemotherapy (CHT) are considered as standard options in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) while stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment in this setting. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of LAPC patients treated with SBRT +/- CHT vs CRT +/- CHT in terms of local control (LC), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Eighty patients were included. Patients in the two cohorts were matched according to: age <=/>65 years, tumor diameter (two cut-offs: =3.0 and =3.9 cm), clinical tumor stage and clinical nodal stage, neoadjuvant CHT, and adjuvant CHT. Median prescribed total dose was 30.0 Gy (range: 18.0-37.5) and 54.0 Gy (18.0-63.0) in SBRT and CRT cohorts, respectively. Toxicity was evaluated by CTCAE v4.0 scale. Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. For hypothesis testing an equivalence and a non-inferiority test was calculated. No statistically significant differences in terms of acute and late toxicity, DMFS, PFS, and OS were recorded among the two cohorts. Median, 1-, and 2-year LC was: 16.0 months, 53.1%, and 40.5% in the CRT cohort and 22.0 months, 80.4%, and 49.8% in the SBRT cohort, respectively (P:.017). A statistically non-inferiority significance was recorded in terms of OS between CRT and SBRT (P =.031). Patients treated with SBRT showed higher LC rate and similar OS compared to CRT. Therefore, the design of confirmatory randomized studies comparing SBRT and CRT seems justified.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
623,"Risks factors concerning bone loss in Moroccan patients with inflammatory bowel diseases Background: Osteoporosis and osteopenia have been reported frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the study: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of osteoporosis in patients with IBD. Method(s): Prospective study was performed from January 2010 to October 2011 in our center, 96 patients with IBD (55 Crohn's Disease, 41 Ulcerative Colitis) were included, 54 men and 42 women with a mean age of 36+/-10.4 years (18 68 years) and no history of disorders known to influence bone metabolism. Dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) were obtained at the femoral neck and lumbar spine. A multivariate model including those factors significantly associated with low BMD in the univariate analysis was used to identify independent risk factors. Result(s): Osteopenia was found in 37.7% and osteoporosis in 22.5% of patients. Low BMD was significantly associated with low body mass index (BMI), colonic involvement, and glucocorticoid therapy. Low BMI was an independent risk factor for low BMD. Malnutrition with BMI <18 kg/m2 was noted in 41 patients, of whom 76% had low BMD values, as compared to 49% of the patients whose BMI was >18 kg/m2 (P = 0.02, odds ratio = 3.5).

201,"Gastrointestinal hemorrhage after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer Background/Aims: While chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is considered to be a reasonable treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), there is little information about the associated risk of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. We investigated the clinical features of GI toxicity after CRT in patients with LAPC and examined the effect of GI hemorrhage on survival. Method(s): Patients enrolled in this study had received CRT for pathologically proven LAPC. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): A total of 156 patients with LAPC (median age, 65 years; range, 39 to 90 years) who received treatment between August 2005 and March 2009 were included in this study. The most common GI toxicities were ulcer formation (25.6%) and hemorrhage (25.6%), and the most common grade 3 to grade 5 GI toxicity was hemorrhage (65%). The origins of GI hemorrhage were gastric ulcer (37.5%), duodenal ulcer (37.5%), and radiation gastritis (15.0%). The independent risk factor for GI hemorrhage was tumor location in the pancreatic body. The median overall survival of the patients with a GI hemorrhage was 13.8 months (range, 2.8 to 50.8 months) and was not significantly different from that of patients without GI hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): GI hemorrhage was common in patients with LAPC after CRT. Although GI hemorrhage was controlled with endoscopic hemostasis, preventive measures should be investigated to reduce needless suffering.",Excluded
175,"Failures (cause and time) of radiotherapy in oral cancer The results of retrospective clinical evaluation concerning 434 cases of oral carcinomas treated with radiotherapy from January 1959 to December 1967 are presented. The analysis of the results obtained shows that radiotherapy alone may offer a reasonable possiblity of success in limited lesions (68.3% 5-year survival of Stage I patients). In more advanced local cases, and especially those with regional adenopathies, radiotherapy alone cannot consistently control the disease for a long period of time; 5-year survival from the onset of treatment was respectively 36.5% and 24.5% for Stage II and III cases. Moreover, if controlateral of bilateral metastatic adenopathies or fixed lymph nodes are present, the prognosis becomes dramatic (2.6% 5-year survival of Stage IV patients). Among the irradiation techniques currently available, curietherapy (intersitial applications or surface molds) presumably offers the best possibility of success, since the observed failures, both overall and stage by stage, are inferior. Radiotherapy alone may generally be of proven efficacy if the local or locoregional extension is limited. In more advanced cases a combined surgery-chemotherapy treatment method is recommended. The criteria for a combined therapeutic approach for these tumors are also discussed.",Excluded
703,"Special proliferative sites are not needed for seeding and proliferation of transfused bone marrow cells in normal syngeneic mice The widely held view that transfused bone marrow cells will not proliferate in normal mice, not exposed to irradiation or other forms of bone marrow ablation, was reinvestigated. Forty million bone marrow cells from male donors were given to female recipients on each of 5 consecutive days, 5 to 10 times the number customarily used in the past. When the recipients were examined 2-13 weeks after the last transfusion, donor cells were found to average 16-25% of total marrow cells. Similar percentages of donor cells were found when variants of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase determined electrophoretically were used for identification of donor and recipient cells. Evidence is presented that the proportion of donor cells is compatible with a linear dependence on the number of cells transfused over the range tested--i.e., 20-200 million bone marrow cells injected intravenously. Special proliferative sites thus do not appear to be required.",Excluded
502,"A feasibility study using three-dimensional conformal boost technique in locally advanced carcinoma of the nasopharynx To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of dose escalation using three-dimensional (3-D) conformal boost technique, 21 patients with stage III or IV nasopharyngeal cancer were enrolled in a prospective protocol. All patients with node metastases initially received external radiotherapy by conventional technique up to 70.2 Gy, followed by 3-D conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT) to the boost part up to 79.2 Gy with 9 Gy increments (daily fraction of 1.8 Gy for 5 days). A modified technique with the same dose escalation of 9 Gy using 3-D CRT was applied to 7 patients without node metastases, who were treated by conventional technique up to 54 Gy, followed by 3-D CRT to boost up to a basic dose of 70.2 Gy, and then finally with dose escalation of 9 Gy. The protocol was relatively well tolerated by the majority of patients. Acute complications during the dose escalation schedule was low, with rare occurrences of grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Although late radiation-induced complications also appeared limited, 1 patient developed a temporal lobe necrosis and 2 patients suffered from sensory-neural hearing loss. There were no radiation-induced fatal complications. At a median follow-up of 48 months, only 3 patients experienced local failure and 2 patients developed distant metastases. The 5-year overall actuarial survival rate and recurrence-free survival rate for all patients were 68% and 85%, respectively. On the basis of acceptable morbidity and encouraging treatment results, we conclude that the dose escalation in 9 Gy increments using a 3-D conformal boost technique is relatively safe and efficacious, enough to be used routinely for locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancers.",Excluded
577,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included

The significance of 68Ga utility is reflected in the implementation of European Pharmacopoeia monographs. However, there is one crucial point in the monographs that might limit the use of the generators and consequently expansion of 68Ga applications and that is the limit of 0.001% of Germanium-68 (68Ge(IV)) radioactivity content in a radiophar-maceutical. We have investigated the organ distribution of 68Ge(IV) in rat and estimated human dosimetry parameters in order to provide experimental evidence for the determination and justification of the 68Ge(IV) limit. Male and female rats were injected in the tail vein with formulated [68Ge]GeCl4 in the absence or presence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. The tissue radioactivity distribution data was extrapolated for the estimation of human organ equivalent doses and total effective dose using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM). 68Ge(IV) was evenly distributed among the rat organs and fast renal excretion prevailed. Human organ equivalent dose and total effective dose estimates indicated that the kidneys were the dose-limiting organs (185+/-54 muSv/MBq for female and 171+/-38 muSv/MBq for male) and the total effective dose was 15.5+/-0.1 and 10.7+/-1.2 muSv/MBq, respectively for female and male.

Intravenous administration of FDG is sometimes halted due to troubles. In such cases, estimations of the FDG dosage injected prior to halting administration may be helpful. We have established a method of estimating the activity of FDG to patients on the basis of the dose equivalent rate on the surface of the right temporal region of the head. The correlation of actual administered dosage with independent variables, such as the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head, age, sex, and body weight, was analyzed using multiple regression analysis to obtain linear, quadratic, and cubic regression equations. Result(s): When entering independent variables, the cubic regression equation could be used to estimate an administered dosage with an accuracy of +/-10 % for 62 % of all patients and +/-20 % for 90 % of all patients.

Background(s): The use of RT3DTEE to guide a transcatheter radiofrequency ablation procedure has never been systematically investigated. Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with CVTI-dependent atrial flutter underwent CVTI ablation. Procedural monitoring using RT3DTEE was assigned to patients who requested general anesthesia for the procedure (n = 21 [30%]). In the other 49 patients (the control group), the procedures were monitored using the standard fluoroscopic approach. Procedural time was considered as skin-to-skin electrophysiological procedure duration, not including anesthesia preparation; adequate radiofrequency ablation applications (with fixed temperature and power settings) were considered as lesions lasting < 60 s. Result(s): RT3DTEE allowed visualization of the CVTI and identified related structures in most patients (20 of 21); anatomic features such as long CVTI (n = 11), prominent Eustachian ridge (n = 9), prominent Eustachian valve (n = 6), septal recess (n = 8), and pectinate muscles (n = 10) were frequent. Also, RT3DTEE allowed continuous visualization of ablation catheter movement and contact. Compared with the control group, RT3DTEE was equally effective in achieving CVTI bidirectional block (100% in both groups), and no complications occurred.

522,"Correlation between fracture healing status and euroqol score (EQ-5D) during conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health related quality of life outcome. There are few reports investigating the relationship between fracture healing status and EQ-5D after conservative treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHOD(S): Forty consecutive patients (5 male, 35 female, average age: 78) had fresh VCFs due to primary osteoporosis diagnosed by MRI. They were treated in hospital for 2 to 3 weeks by conservative therapy consisting of medication (NSAIDs, Alendronate, Calcitonin) and brace. EQ-5D and questionnaires were collected at pre-fracture (retrospective) and post-fracture at first visit, at discharge and after 12-week conservative therapy. Radiographic evaluation was conducted by flexion-extension X-ray and CT. Pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed when the intervertebral cleft was seen in both X-ray and CT, and there was a motion more than 3-degrees in flexion-extension X-rays. Correlations among fracture healing status, brace compliance, and EuroQOL score were investigated. Final follow-up rate was 85% (34/40). RESULT(S): There were 30 patients who could move by themselves (Group A), and other 10 patients who could not even turn over due to severe pain (Group B). EQ-5D at pre-fracture, post-fracture, discharge, and after conservative therapy were 0.9067, 0.5030, 0.7538, and 0.7688 in Group A, 0.7359, -0.0179, 0.5546, and 0.7948 in Group B, respectively. Post-fracture EQ-5D in Group B was significantly lower (p<0.0001). Pseudoarthrosis was found in 6 cases (18%), while the intervertebral cleft was observed in 41 at 12-weeks. All these 6 cases answered as the brace compliance, almost all day"". Average EQ-5D in these 6 cases was 0.2657 at first visit and 0.689 after 12-week therapy, which was significantly lower than that of other fracture healed cases(0.8029, p=0.0001). DISCUSSION: Successful fracture healing rate in this conservative therapy was 82%. Eighteen percent of pseudoarthrosis patients with lower EQ-5D could be candidates for the interventional therapy.""",Excluded
233,"Adjuvant radiochemotherapy of stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma: role of CEA and CA 19-9 BACKGROUND: This analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of pre-radiotherapy CEA and CA 19-9 values on clinical outcome of locally advanced rectal cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from patients (n=203) with UICC stage II and III rectal adenocarcinomas, who underwent low anterior or abdominoperineal resection and received post-operative or pre-operative radiochemotherapy from January 1989 until July 2002. The rates of survival and distant and local recurrences were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards (median follow-up 8 years). Multivariate analysis was used to assess the prognostic value of CEA and CA 19-9.
RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates for patients with normal (n =118) and elevated (n=88) CEA values were as follows: overall survival 62.4% and 32.0% (p<0.001), local control 73.5% and 55.0% (p=0.007), and absence of distant metastasis 83.3% and 88.0% (n.s.), respectively. Similar results were obtained for patients with normal (n=82) and elevated (n = 10) CA 19-9 values: overall survival 60.7% and 14.0% (p=0.007), local control 83.7% and 80.0% (n.s.), and absence of distant metastasis 64.9% and 75.0% (n.s.), respectively. After adjustment for TNM stage, sex, age, LDH, tumor site and grading, the elevation of CEA proved to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (relative risk of 1.01 per ng/ml, CI 1.002 - 1.01; p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the prognostic value of pre-radiotherapy CEA and CA 19-9 in patients with stage II or III rectal carcinoma.",Excluded
718,"Radiation or chemotherapy cystitis with pseudocarcinomatous"" features"" BACKGROUND: The features of radiation or chemotherapy cystitis mimicking invasive urothelial cancer are not widely known., DESIGN: A search of the consultation files from our institution between January 1996 and September 2003 identified 20 patients with bladder biopsies showing cystitis mimicking invasive urothelial cancer., RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 69 years (range, 40-85 years); 80% were males. Complete history was not available in 1 patient. Seventeen patients had a history of pelvic irradiation (15 prostate cancer and 2 endometrial cancer). Two patients had systemic chemotherapy (1 metastatic colon cancer and 1 mixed connective tissue disease). All patients presented with hematuria. The mean time from radiation and/or chemotherapy to presentation was 27 months (range, 0-84 months). All cases showed epithelial proliferation that mimicked invasive cancer within the lamina propria, with marked proliferation seen in 45% of cases. Mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism was seen in all cases. A characteristic feature was the presence of pseudoinvasive urothelial nests wrapping around the vessels associated with fibrin deposition. Most cases did not show any mitoses (75%). Ulceration was seen in 39% of cases. All cases showed some degree of hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and fibrin thrombi, fibrosis, and acute and chronic inflammation, with hemosiderin identified in 60% of cases. Edema and vascular congestion were common features (95% and 80%, respectively). Thickened vessels and vascular changes associated with radiation injury were identified in 75% of cases. Seventeen patients were followed for a mean of 9 months (range, 0.25-37 months), and none developed bladder cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation or chemotherapy cystitis can show epithelial proliferations that may be confused with invasive urothelial carcinomas. Other findings characteristic of radiation or chemotherapy cystitis, such as hemorrhage, fibrin, and vascular changes, are often seen in association with the epithelial proliferations and are helpful in distinguishing it from invasive cancer. Pathologists must be aware that these changes may be seen with a remote radiation or chemotherapy history, where this information may not be provided or known at the time of the biopsy evaluation.",Excluded
344,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included

To compare image quality and radiation exposure in step-and-shoot CCTA and high-pitch spiral CCTA. Fifty-nine pairs of patients matched for weight, height, sex and heart rate were included in this study (74 m, 44 f, average age 60 years, age range 29-94 years). Step-and-shoot CCTA and high-pitch spiral CCTA was performed on a third generation dual-source CT in equally sized patient groups. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the ascending aorta and the coronary arteries were determined for each dataset. Image quality was rated using a five-point scale. We used the t-test for paired samples to compare SNR and effective dose, and the Wilcoxon test to compare image quality scores. Mean effective dose for the step-and-shoot protocol (4.15 +/- 3.07 mSv) was significantly higher in comparison to the high-pitch spiral protocol (1.2 +/- 0.69 mSv; p < 0.0001). Mean SNR was higher with the step-and-shoot protocol compared to the high-pitch spiral protocol in the aorta, in the left main and peripheral coronary arteries (p < 0.01), in the proximal right coronary artery (p = 0.027). Image quality scores were significantly better for the step-and-shoot protocol (p = 0.0003).

19,"Relationship between femoral anteversion and osteoarthritis of the hip The purpose of this study was to establish a relationship between the magnitude of femoral anteversion and osteoarthritis of the hip. Sixteen osteoarthritic subjects were compared with 18 control subjects by an improved computed tomography (CT) scanning technique. Femoral anteversion was accurately determined with little radiation exposure. There was no significant difference in femoral anteversion between arthritic subjects and a normal"" control population. There was no significant difference in femoral anteversion between the involved and the uninvolved hips of these subjects with osteoarthritis. These results suggest that performing a derotational femoral osteotomy to prevent osteoarthritis is not indicated. The cause of primary osteoarthritis is multifactorial and does not depend solely on preexistence of higher femoral anteversion.""",Excluded
941,"Age at exposure to ionising radiation and cancer mortality among Hanford workers: Follow up through 1994 Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.",Included

In addition to the in vitro electrophysiological studies, open-field tests were run to detect possible behavioural changes associated with cortical oversensitization. Enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated component of the evoked field response appeared in the barrel cortex after nerve injury. The alteration was transient, very distinct on the first day following injury, and almost returned to normal level by the end of the second week. Behavioural changes had not followed this time-course since long-lasting alterations were detected in the open-field test. These observations are in agreement with findings that showed biphasic regenerative processes following nerve injuries in other cortical areas.",Excluded

A study of the French GETTEC group Background/Hypothesis: The need for a neck dissection after radiochemotherapy (RCT) for patients with unresectable cancer of the head and neck remains questionable. We evaluated our strategy to perform a neck dissection in patients with a controlled primary tumor based on the response to RCT according to regional control, survival rates, and morbidity. Study Design: The French Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs de la Tete et du Cou"" (GETTEC) group retrospectively performed a multicenter review. One hundred and three stage III (N=7) or IV (N=96) patients with unresectable primary tumors and node-positive disease and no distant metastases treated between 1996 and 2002. Tumors were considered unresectable or with poor surgical curability based on advanced stage, or patients were surgically unfit for medical reasons. Result(s): With a median follow-up of 30 months, the complete clinical and radiological nodal response rate was 61%. Among 39% (N=40) of patients with residual neck disease, 70% (N=28) underwent a neck dissection, whereas the remaining 30% either underwent watchful follow-up for probable scary nodes, or were deemed unresectable or medically unfit for surgery. Half of the neck dissection specimens showed pathological evidence of viable tumor. Grade 3 to 4 complications were recorded in four patients (14%) after neck dissection. Regional control was better for complete responders. Disease-free survival and overall survival were similar between patients with a complete response in the neck and no neck dissection, and patients with a neck dissection for residual neck disease. Conclusion(s): The strategy to avoid a neck dissection is safe in patients with a complete response in the neck, regardless of initial nodal stage. In patients with residual neck disease, postRCT neck dissection can be performed with limited morbidity. Progress is warranted to optimize the pathological response in the nodes and to better assess ambiguous nodal responses with multi-modal imaging. © 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.""",Excluded
278,"Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy with a total dose of 54-56 Gy given in 9-7 fractions for patients with peripheral lung tumor: impact of maximum dose and fraction size BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer has been recently reported. However, incidence of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes with a long-term follow-up time are not clarified. We examined incidence and risk factors of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes for the patients with peripherally located lung tumor., METHODS: During 2003-2008, 41 patients with 42 lung tumors were treated with SBRT to 54-56 Gy in 9-7 fractions. The endpoint in the study was radiation-induced rib fracture detected by CT scan after the treatment. All ribs where the irradiated doses were more than 80% of prescribed dose were selected and contoured to build the dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Comparisons of the several factors obtained from the DVHs and the probabilities of rib fracture calculated by Kaplan-Meier method were performed in the study., RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 68 months. Among 75 contoured ribs, 23 rib fractures were observed in 34% of the patients during 16-48 months after SBRT, however, no patients complained of chest wall pain. The 4-year probabilities of rib fracture for maximum dose of ribs (Dmax) more than and less than 54 Gy were 47.7% and 12.9% (p = 0.0184), and for fraction size of 6, 7 and 8 Gy were 19.5%, 31.2% and 55.7% (p = 0.0458), respectively. Other factors, such as D2cc, mean dose of ribs, V10-55, age, sex, and planning target volume were not significantly different., CONCLUSIONS: The doses and fractionations used in this study resulted in no clinically significant rib fractures for this population, but that higher Dmax and dose per fraction treatments resulted in an increase in asymptomatic grade 1 rib fractures.",Excluded

Blood samples were taken to determine immune status using CD4%, and virological status was identified using plasma HIV-RNA viral load (HIV-VL) assay: at baseline before RT at the last week of RT completion; and at the 6-month follow-up visit. Additional CD4% test was performed at the 3-month follow-up visit., RESULTS: Ninety HIV-infected cancer patients from seven hospitals in Thailand were included in the analysis. The median age was 40 years old (range 19-61). Seventy-six patients (84.4%) were female and 65 (72.2%) were cases of invasive cervical cancers. Eighty-seven percent of patients had been receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) before RT The mean CD4% at baseline, RT completion, 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits, were 18.7%, 20.1%, 16.8% and 17.1%, respectively.

726,"Photochemical repair of Achilles tendon rupture in a rat model Background. Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is an emerging technique for bonding or sealing tissue surfaces that requires light and a photoactive dye for its effect. The potential of PTB for tendon repair was assessed in a rat model. Materials and methods. The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration as a function of wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0.68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0.04) but not 14 days (p = 0.75) post-repair. Conclusions. PTB provides a benefit to tendon repair at early stages in repair and is worthy of further investigation as a potential surgical adjunct for tendon repair in orthopedic surgeries. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

869,"Application of interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach to enhance dose in radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Although intracavitary irradiation (ICI) is usually applied to enhance dose in radiotherapy for early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), its use in parapharyngeal enhancing dose is limited because of dislocation and poor repetition of conventional catheterization. This study was to evaluate the application of a new technique, interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach, to enhance dose in radiotherapy for NPC. METHOD(S): Twenty-three naive and recurrent NPC patients with tumor residue of more than 1 cm under nasopharyngeal mucosa or restricted tumor residue in the parapharyngeal space received interstitial brachytherapy between Sep. 2005 and Aug. 2006 via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach under the guidance of sinus endoscopy. The 3-dimensional (3D) planning system was used to delineate target volume, optimize dose distribution, and perform interstitial brachytherapy after CT scan. The depths of catheters under mucosa on the moment of inserting and pulling out were measured. The efficacy and complications were assessed. RESULT(S): All catheters were intubated into tumors successfully; the veracity of catheter location was 100%. The submucosa depths of catheters were (9.59+/-2.72) mm when inserted and (9.43+/-2.30) mm when pulled out, without significant difference (t = 0.23,P > 0.05); the shift length was (0.75+/-0.75) mm. The patients were followed up from 3 to 15 months (median, 6 months), and no one dropt out. Three cases of irradiation-associated turbinate adhesion occurred and were cured after lysis; no infection, serious bleeding, palatal perforation, nasopharyngeal necrosis, and other serious complications occurred. All tumors disappeared in 3 months after treatment. No local recurrence and distant metastasis occurred. CONCLUSION(S): The nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal catheterization with sinus endoscopy guidance is accurate, steady, safe, and feasible. Interstitial brachytherapy is effective for tumor residue in the nasopharynx or parapharyngeal space of NPC patients after radiotherapy without serious complications.",Excluded

Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudoternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as lipid, Labrasol as surfactant, and Tween 20 as cosurfactant for preparation of self-emulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the phase diagrams and subjected to thermodynamic stability studies and dispersibility tests. The prepared liquid SNEDDS formulations were characterized for viscosity, refractive index, droplet size and zeta potential. The TEM study confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion following dilution of liquid SNEDDS. The optimized liquid SNEDDS were transformed into free flowing granules by adsorption on the porous carriers like Sylysia (350, 550, and 730) and Neusilin TM US2. Solid state characterization employing the FTIR, DSC and powder XRD studies indicated lack of any significant interaction of drug with the lipidic and emulsifying excipients, and porous carriers. In vitro drug release studies indicated faster solubilization of the drug by optimized SSNEGs (over 80% within 30 min) vis-a-vis the pure drug (only 35% within 30 min). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats observed significant increase in C(max) (3.01-fold) and AUC (5.34-fold) using SSNEGs compared to pure drug, whereas no significant difference (p>0.1) was observed with the liquid SNEDDS. Thus, the present studies ratify the bioavailability enhancement potential of SSNEGs of ONH prepared using porous carriers. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

545,"Exploring lag and duration effect of sunshine in triggering suicide BACKGROUND: Sunshine is considered to have a beneficial impact on mood. Interestingly, it has been consistently found that the incidence of suicide reaches a peak during early summer., METHODS: In order to explore the pattern of sunshine and suicide risk in a time frame of up to nine days and investigate possible lag and duration parameters of sunshine in the triggering of suicide, Greek daily suicide and solar radiance data were analyzed for a 10-year period using logistic regression models., RESULTS: The solar radiance during the day before the suicide event was significantly associated with an increased suicide risk (OR=1.020 per MW/m2). The average solar radiance during the four previous days was also significantly associated with an increased suicide risk (OR=1.031 per MW/m2). Differences among genders include the longer sunshine exposure needed in males to trigger suicide, compared to females and a lag period of three to four days that was found to lapse in females till the suicide. The increase in suicide risk in June compared to December, attributable to the daily sunshine effect, varies from 52% to 88%, thus explaining the already known suicide monthly seasonality., LIMITATIONS: No individual data on solar radiance exposure, mental disorders, alcohol consumption or suicide method were available., CONCLUSION: The effect of sunshine in the triggering of suicide may be mediated through a mechanism with a specific lag and duration effect, during the nine days preceding suicide. We hypothesize that sunshine acts as a natural antidepressant which first improves motivation, then only later improves mood, thereby creating a potential short-term increased risk of suicide initially upon its application.",Excluded
1078,"Polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes in radiation-related and sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) etiologically occurs as a radiation-induced or sporadic malignancy. Genetic factors contributing to the susceptibility to either form remain unknown. In this retrospective case-control study, we evaluated possible associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate DNA damage response genes (ATM, XRCC1, TP53, XRCC3, MTF1) and risk of radiation-induced and sporadic PTC. A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively). The ATM IVS22-77 T > C and TP53 Arg72Pro SNPs interacted with radiation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively). ATM IVS22-77 associated with the increased risk of sporadic PTC (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) whereas TP53 Arg72Pro correlated with the higher risk of radiogenic PTC (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-2.36). In the analyses of ATM/TP53 (rs1801516/rs664677/rs609429/rs1042522) combinations, the GG/TC/CG/GC genotype strongly associated with radiation-induced PTC (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.17-3.78). The GG/CC/GG/GG genotype displayed a significantly increased risk for sporadic PTC (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.57-6.99). The results indicate that polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes may be potential risk modifiers of ionizing radiation-induced or sporadic PTCs.",Included
855,"Physicochemical properties of calcific deposits isolated from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves removed from patients following 2-13 years function The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of calcific deposits that cause the failure of tissue-derived heart valve bioprostheses. This was done in an effort to understand the mechanism of pathologic biomineralization in the cardiovascular system and potentially prevent deterioration of bioprostheses. Calcific deposits taken from 10 failed bioprosthetic valves that had been implanted in patients for 2-13 years were characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and solubility measurements. The combined results identified the biomineral as an apatitic calcium phosphate salt with substantial incorporation of sodium, magnesium and carbonate. The average Ca/PO4 ratio for this young"" pathologic biomineral was approximately 1.3, considerably lower than approximately 1.7 found in mature atherosclerotic plaque biomineral and mature skeletal biomineral, both of which approximate hydroxyapatite in composition. Deproteinated calcific deposits from bioprostheses had thermodynamic solubilities comparable to those of both atherosclerotic plaque, typical pathologic biomineral and hydrolyzed octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5 H2O), a proposed precursor phase to biomineral apatite. This later finding, together with chemical composition and structural details of the bioprosthetic deposits themselves, supports a mechanism of cardiovascular calcification in which OCP plays a crucial role in the formation of the final apatitic phase. This suggests an approach toward prevention of bioprosthetic tissue calcification through control of the formation of the kinetically favored OCP precursor and/or its transformation into bioapatite.""",Excluded
1030,"Cancer incidence among Australian nuclear industry workers To assess whether workers at Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre (LHSTC) had different levels of cancer incidence from the New South Wales (NSW) population in Australia. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken at LHSTC. Data on 7,076 workers employed between 1957-98 were abstracted from personnel, dosimetry, and medical files. An inception cohort was defined which included 4,523 workers in employment between 1972-96 to examine cancer incidence. Cancer registrations in the inception cohort were identified to 1996 through electronic linkage of records with the NSW and the Australian national registers of cancer incidence. All-cancer incidence in workers at LHSTC was 15% below the NSW rates [SIR=0.85; 95% CI=(0.75, 0.95)]. Of 37 specific cancers and groups of cancers examined, statistically significant excesses relative to NSW rates were observed only for pleural cancer incidence [SIR=17.71; 95%=(7.96, 39.43)], and for incidence of cancer of the small intestine [SIR=4.34; 95% CI=(1.40, 13.46)]. This study gives little evidence of an increased risk of cancers associated with radiation exposure in a cohort of nuclear workers in Australia. The observed increase in the risk of cancer of the pleura was probably due to unmeasured exposures, given the lack of an established association with radiation exposure, and the strong link to asbestos exposure. Findings for cancers of the small intestine were based on small numbers and were likely to be due to chance.",Included
573,"Safety of 14C-UBT for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in pregnancy QUESTION: A 29-year-old woman had a carbon 14 urea breath test for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. At time of consultation, it had been 6 weeks since her last menstrual period. Four weeks after her last menstrual period, the results of a urine pregnancy test were negative. On that day, she received an ionizing radiation dose of 74 KBq (2 microCi) carbon 14 urea, followed by the breath test 30 minutes thereafter. Four days later, when the urine pregnancy test results turned positive, she was concerned about the possible effect of her exposure to ionizing radiation on the developing fetus. ANSWER: The amount of radiation used in these tests is extremely low-much lower than the amount a pregnant woman is absorbing through natural sources. [References: 10]",Excluded

729,"A study of dentists' knowledge about dental radiology principles Background and Objective: The use of dental radiography is inevitable in order for disease diagnosis, assessment and monitoring. Radiogeraphy is potentially harmful due to the use of ionizing radiation. This study was conducted to evaluate dentists' knowledge about the principles of dental radiology. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was performed on 600 general dentists willing to cooperate with this study in Amol, Noor, Mahmoodabad and Sari cities located in Mazandaran province, Iran, in 2014. All the data were obtained by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire included two parts; the first part surveyed demographic information, and the second part included 11 items about radiographic technique and equipments. Finding(s): 500 questionnaires were completed. Among the surveyed population, 335 (67%) and 165 (33%) dentists were male and female, respectively. The mean of practical experiences was 12.35+/-6.68 years. 469 dentists (93.8%) used the dental X-ray machine with digital timer and 404 dentists (80.8%) used the dental X-ray machine with long cone tube. Additionally, 470(94%) X-ray machine had round. Generally, 367 (73.4%) and 374 (74.8%) dentists used bisecting technique and E-speed films, respectively. Also, annual calibration of X-ray devices was suggested by 416 (83.2%) dentists.

270,"Automated synthesis and dosimetry of 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF): A radiotracer for imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer 6-Deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF) is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging GLUT5 in breast cancer. The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded

445,"Drivers for Sun Protection in Black South Africans Sun protection behavior studies are almost exclusively carried out in populations with fair skin for the obvious reason that people with unpigmented skin are more susceptible to the health impacts of excess solar ultraviolet radiation exposure. In a dataset of 1271 Black South Africans, we analyzed factors related to sun protection applied when spending time outdoors including awareness of skin cancer, gender, age and Living Standards Measure (LSM) where 1-4 equate to the lowest, 5-7 intermediate and 8-10 the highest LSM status. The most important driver for Black South Africans to use sun protection was whether they were aware of skin cancer (OR: 2.6 for those who were aware versus those who were not, P < 0.0001). Sunscreen was preferred by respondents in LSM 8-10 whereas people in the lowest group (LSM 1-4) favored shade, umbrellas and hats. One in two respondents claimed to use some form of sun protection, which appears to be higher than deeply pigmented populations in other countries.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Photobiology.",Excluded
754,"Massive introgression drives species radiation at the range limit of Anopheles gambiae Impacts of introgressive hybridisation may range from genomic erosion and species collapse to rapid adaptation and speciation but opportunities to study these dynamics are rare. We investigated the extent, causes and consequences of a hybrid zone between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae in Guinea-Bissau, where high hybridisation rates appear to be stable at least since the 1990s. Anopheles gambiae was genetically partitioned into inland and coastal subpopulations, separated by a central region dominated by A. coluzzii. Surprisingly, whole genome sequencing revealed that the coastal region harbours a hybrid form characterised by an A. gambiae-like sex chromosome and massive introgression of A. coluzzii autosomal alleles. Local selection on chromosomal inversions may play a role in this process, suggesting potential for spatiotemporal stability of the coastal hybrid form and providing resilience against introgression of medically-important loci and traits, found to be more prevalent in inland A. gambiae.",Excluded
432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded
479,"The effect of chemotherapy on the latency interval of radiation induced sarcomas Aim: Radiation induced sarcoma typically manifests 10-20 years after initial radiation exposure. Contemporary cancer treatment often includes a combination of radiation therapy with chemotherapy. This may influence the pattern of second cancer in long term survivors. We performed an audit of radiation induced sarcoma seen in the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Method(s): Patients were identified through the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Patients with a sarcoma diagnosis between June 2005 and June 2010 were identified. Fourteen patients were identified to have radiation induced sarcoma. Result(s): Seven of the patients were female and seven were male. The median age was 54. Of the initial diagnoses, four were sarcoma, five adenocarcinoma. two squamous cell carcinoma, one ependymoma, one melanoma and one lymphoma. The median radiation dose was 50Gy. Five patients received chemotherapy at the time of the initial radiotherapy. The median latency interval for patients who received chemotherapy was 5.1 years, and mean latency interval 5 years. Patients who did not receive chemotherapy had a longer median latency interval of 13.6 years and significantly longer mean latency interval of 13.5 years (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): We hypothesise that chemotherapy shortens the latency interval of radiation induced sarcomas. This could possibly be through the synergistic effect of chemoradiation on genomic instability in normal cells. To confirm these findings, a large scale multicenter study is required.",Excluded

Retrospective study of 135 cases OBJECTIVE: To report the profile of histologic cervical nodes involvement associated with mobile tongue squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study concerned patients treated from 1978 to 1998 by cervical neck dissection for mobile tongue carcinoma. RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded
115,"Nonmelanoma skin cancer in mountain guides: high prevalence and lack of awareness warrant development of evidence-based prevention tools AIMS OF THE STUDY: Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in Switzerland and Europe. The main causative factor is exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which puts outdoor workers in general at a higher risk of developing NMSC than indoor workers. However, few studies have clinically examined the risk of developing NMSC to outdoor workers, especially mountain guides. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of NMSC and corresponding precancerous lesions, and the associated risk behaviour of mountain and ski guides in order to develop future prevention programmes., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including mountain and ski guides from southern Germany, who underwent a full-body skin check-up by a dermatologist. We assessed their NMSC awareness and risk behaviour using a paper-based questionnaire., RESULTS: Of the 62 state-certified mountain and ski guides (55 men, 7 women; mean age 52.9 +/- 13.4 years) included in this study, 27 (43.5%) were diagnosed with NMSC or its premalignant stages. In addition, 59.7% of the participants expressed the opinion that their protection from ultraviolet radiation exposure needs to be improved; 83.6% requested further information on NMSC, and 48.5% had never undergone a skin check-up or consulted a dermatologist before., CONCLUSIONS: Mountain and ski guides are at a high risk for developing NMSC. Their unmet medical needs indicate an underestimation of NMSC prevalence, which is usually based on reports by insurance companies, and offer the chance for developing evidence-based awareness and prevention tools that can be promoted to individuals with other outdoor jobs.",Excluded
47,"Altered depression-related behaviors and functional changes in the dorsal raphe nucleus of serotonin transporter-deficient mice BACKGROUND: As a key regulator of serotonergic activity and target of many antidepressant treatments, the serotonin transporter (SERT) represents a potential mediator of anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Using mice lacking the SERT (SERT KO), we examined the role of SERT function in anxiety- and depression-related behaviors and serotonergic neuron function., METHODS: Serotonin transporter knockout mice were evaluated in paradigms designed to assess anxiety-, depression-, and stress-related behaviors. Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) function was assessed by quantitative serotonergic cell counting and extracellular electrical recording of neuronal firing properties., RESULTS: Serotonin transporter knockout mice showed an increase in latency to feed in a novel situation, more immobility in a forced swim, increased escape latency in a shock escape paradigm, and decreased immobility in tail suspension. No differences in anxiety-related behaviors were seen in the open field and the elevated plus maze. Serotonin transporter knockout mice exhibit a 50% reduction in serotonergic cell number and a fourfold decrease in firing rate in the DRN., CONCLUSIONS: Developmental loss of SERT produces altered behaviors in models of depression that are generally opposite to those produced by antidepressant treatment. The reduced serotonergic cell number and firing rate in the DRN of adult SERT KO mice suggest a mechanism for these altered behaviors.",Excluded
427,"Comparison of radioiodine biokinetics following the administration of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone and after thyroid hormone withdrawal in thyroid carcinoma Iodine kinetics were studied in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer while euthyroid under exogenous thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and while hypothyroid to detect differences in radioiodine uptake, distribution and elimination. Nine patients with total or near-total thyroidectomy on thyroid hormone suppressive therapy received two or three daily doses of 0.9 mg recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) followed by administration of a diagnostic activity of 2 mCi (74 MBq) iodine-131. After the biokinetics assessments had been performed, patients stopped taking thyroid hormones to become hypothyroid. A second 2 mCi (74 MBq) diagnostic activity of 131I was administered, followed by a second set of biokinetics assessments. One week later the patients underwent remnant ablation with a therapeutic activity of 131I. A comparison of the 131I kinetics in the patients while euthyroid and while hypothyroid showed major differences in the doses to the remnant as well as in residence times and radiation exposure to the blood. In the first diagnostic assessment the remnant dose was higher in eight of the nine patients and clearance of the activity from the blood was faster in all of them. The data from this study suggest that radioiodine administration is potent and safe when administered to euthyroid patients following rhTSH administration. Enhanced residence time in the remnant and decreased radiation exposure to the blood were noted when patients were euthyroid compared to when they were rendered hypothyroid. However, all patients received diagnostic activities in the same order: first while euthyroid, followed by hypothyroidism. It is quite possible that stunning"" from the radioiodine administered in the initial uptake study inhibited the subsequent uptake of radioiodine by the remnant lesions in the second uptake study.""",Excluded
265,"Diagnostic Radiation Exposure in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Background: Because of the chronic and relapsing nature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which often requires characterization with CT scan, IBD patients might be exposed to a large amount of radiation. As a cumulative effective dose (CED) >= 100 mSv is considered significant for stochastic risks of cancer, it is important to monitor and control the radiation exposure of the IBD patients. In the present work, we aimed to quantify the mean CED in IBD patients to assess any harmful effects of radiation., Methods: This study includes 200 IBD patients, identified retrospectively, from the outpatient clinics of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal between January 1, 2010, and February 15, 2017, from the gastroenterologists' patients lists. The number and type of each radiology test performed were listed for each patient during the study period and the CED was calculated using our institution's dose index when available and standardized tables., Results: Among the 200 IBD patients, 157 patients had Crohn's disease (CD), 41 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 2 had indeterminate colitis. The mean CED for IBD patients was 23.1 +/- 45.2 mSv during a mean follow-up duration of 4.3 years. CED was higher among patients with CD than with UC (27.5 +/- 49.5 versus 6.8 +/- 14.8 mSv; p<0.01). Six patients were exposed to a high CED (>100 mSv) and all had CD., Conclusion: While potentially harmful levels of radiation exposure are of concern in only a small number of patients, strategies to limit such exposure are encouraged when clinically appropriate.",Excluded

Additional 3T sequences were acquired with a reduced number of averages and using the parallel acquisition technique for accelerating imaging speed. Artifact size (diameter, area), image quality (5-point scale) and delineation of anatomical structures were compared among the techniques, sequences and field strengths using the Wilcoxon sign-rank and paired t-test with Bonferroni correction., RESULTS: At both field strengths, WARP showed significant superiority over standard sequences regarding image quality, artifact size and delineation of anatomical structures. At 3T, artifacts were larger compared to 1.5T without affecting diagnostic quality, and scanning time could be reduced by up to 64 % without quality degradation., CONCLUSION: WARP proved useful in imaging metal-on-metal hip resurfacings at 1.5T as well as 3T with better image quality surrounding the implants. At 3T imaging could be considerably accelerated without losing diagnostic quality.""",Excluded
999,"Oblique corpectomy for treatment of cervical spine epidural abscesses: Report on four cases Background Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) in cervical locations are particularly life-threatening. Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded
84,"Late complications after high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for tongue cancer Objectives. To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded

1102,"Biopsy of pleural thickenings with pocket size ultrasound device Introduction:Pleural pathology diagnosis is based on the collection of cytological and histological samples. The use of image techniques is becoming more popular to increase accuracy and safety. TAC-guided thoracic biopsy is the most commonly used method but thoracic ultrasound offers some advantages like: absence of ionizing radiations and bedside exploration. Our aim was to analyze effectiveness and safety of the ultrasound-guided pleural biopsies using a pocket size ultrasound device (PSUD). Method(s): A prospective, one-year study from January 2016 to January 2017 was carried out. We included all patients with pleural thickening greater than 3 mm. Pleural biopsy was performed with a 14G gauge automatic needle (Acecut. TSK). Biopsy was completely echo-guided. Result(s):The samples were tagged as adequate sample (AS) or non-adequate sample (NAS) depending on the presence of mesothelium evidenced by the pathologist. Adequate samples (AS) were also tagged as diagnostic samples (DAS) or non-diagnostic samples (NDAS). We enrolled 32 patients. 68.8% were males, mean age of 53 (ED: 31). Biopsy was performed without need of hospitalization in 50 % of the cases. We obtained 26 AS (84.4%). 96.4% of them were diagnostic (DAS). Only one case showed further evidence of pleural involvement in a negative biopsy (mediastinal pleura). The only complication in all the biopsies performed was a pneumothorax without clinical repercussion in a pleural nodule biopsy without pleural effusion. The patient was treated with a conservative approach. Conclusion(s):PSUD is a useful tool to increases effectiveness and safety of the histologic diagnosis of pleural thickening.",Excluded

Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light.

1045,"Assessment of pulmonary 18F-FDG-PET uptake and cytokine profiles in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and erlotinib Purpose To investigate effects of radiotherapy (RT) and erlotinib on pulmonary glucose uptake using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during and after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to identify associations between serum cytokine levels and lung glucose uptake. Material and methods Twenty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC, receiving RT alone or concomitant RT and erlotinib therapy, were examined by 18F-FDG PET before, during, and after treatment. A total of 57 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed. Pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake and radiotherapy dose mapping were used to acquire dose-response curves for each patient, where subsequent linear regression gave a glucose uptake level in the un-irradiated parts of the lungs (SUV0) and a response slope (DELTASUV). Serum cytokine levels at corresponding time points were assessed using a multiplex bioassay. Correlations between the most robust cytokines and lung 18F-FDG dose response parameters were further investigated. Results From the dose response analysis, SUV0 at post-therapy was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than at mid- and pre-therapy (45% and 58%, respectively) for the group receiving RT + erlotinib. Also, SUV0 at post-therapy was higher for patients receiving RT + erlotinib compared to RT alone (42%; P < 0.001). No differences in DELTASUV were seen with treatments or time. SUV0 was positively associated (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) with serum levels of the chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) for patients receiving RT + erlotinib. Conclusions Concomitant RT and erlotinib causes an elevation in pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake post treatment compared to RT alone. Pulmonary glucose uptake is associated with an upregulation of a chemokine (CCL21) involved in inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded
283,"Irradiated male tsetse from a 40-year-old colony are still competitive in a Riparian forest in Burkina Faso BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of African trypanosomosis that constitute a major constraint to development in Africa. Their control is an important component of the integrated management of these diseases, and among the techniques available, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is the sole that is efficient at low densities. The government of Burkina Faso has embarked on a tsetse eradication programme in the framework of the PATTEC, where SIT is an important component. The project plans to use flies from a Glossina palpalis gambiensis colony that has been maintained for about 40 years at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES). It was thus necessary to test the competitiveness of the sterile males originating from this colony., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the period January-February 2010, 16,000 sterile male G. p. gambiensis were released along a tributary of the Mouhoun river. The study revealed that with a mean sterile to wild male ratio of 1.16 (s.d. 0.38), the abortion rate of the wild female flies was significantly higher than before (p = 0.026) and after (p = 0.019) the release period. The estimated competitiveness of the sterile males (Fried index) was 0.07 (s.d. 0.02), indicating that a sterile to wild male ratio of 14.4 would be necessary to obtain nearly complete induced sterility in the female population. The aggregation patterns of sterile and wild male flies were similar. The survival rate of the released sterile male flies was similar to that observed in 1983-1985 for the same colony., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that gamma sterilised male G. p. gambiensis derived from the CIRDES colony have a competitiveness that is comparable to their competitiveness obtained 35 years ago and can still be used for an area-wide integrated pest management campaign with a sterile insect component in Burkina Faso.",Excluded
460,[Post-mortem observation of glioma and/or brain tissue compared to C-T scan findings after irradiation] C-T scan findings in glioma and brain tissue after irradiation were histopathologically analyzed with the post-mortem examination of 4 patients. High density of contrast enhancement observed in gliomas mainly corresponded to proliferation of irregular blood vessels and hypodensity reflected less cellular area or necrotic foci in the tumor tissue. A mottled lesion with high density margin in C-T of radionecrosis of the brain tissue observed in a non-glioma patient was formed by coagulation necrosis showing marked proliferation of telangiectatic blood vessels in periphery of lesion and acellular area in the center. It is occasionally impossible to differentiate the findings between delayed radionecrosis of brain and recurrence of glioma using the C-T criteria alone.,Excluded
433,"Resection status, age and nodal involvement determine survival among patients receiving adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma Context Pancreas cancer can potentially be cured by resection, but the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation has been controversial. Objectives To better define clinicopathological factors that may serve as predictive and/or prognostic variables. Patients Between 1984 and 2006, we retrospectively analyzed 91 patients with pancreas cancer treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy followed by adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation at the University of Pennsylvania. Final pathological coding including margin status was confirmed by a pathologist. Interventions Patients were treated with 48.6 to 63.0 Gy, and 96.7% completed their prescribed radiation dose. Main outcome measures The prognostic significance of demographic factors, stage, year of surgery, tumor location, grade, resection status, and number of positive lymph nodes on overall survival were examined. Results With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the overall median survival was 2.3 years (95% CI 1.5-3.2 years), and the 5-year overall survival was 28.9%. In multivariate analysis, completeness of resection (P<0.001), fewer number of positive lymph nodes (0 vs. 1-2 vs. 3 or more) (P=0.004), and age less than, or equal to, 60 years (P=0.006) were all independently associated with improved overall survival. The overall survival reported in this study compares favorably with the results of other single-institution studies and with the RTOG 97-04 trial. Conclusions Adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiation following radical pancreatectomy can be delivered safely and results in comparatively good overall survival. The results of this analysis underscore the importance of resection status, number of involved lymph nodes and patient age as prognostic characteristics. These factors may be considered stratification variables for future post-pancreatectomy adjuvant therapy trials.",Excluded
20,"An objective scatter index cutoff point as a powerful objective criterion for preoperative nuclear cataract decision-making based on ROC analysis PURPOSE: To assess the correlation between clinical cataract surgery indication and the objective scatter index (OSI) by defining the optimal OSI cutoff point in the surgery scheduling., SETTING: Ophthalmology service, Consorcio Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain., DESIGN: Prospective triple-masked randomized single-center study., METHODS: Patients with cataractous eyes were recruited, and those with anterior segment disease, abnormal posterior pole, and/or previous ocular surgery were excluded. The principle of double-pass aberrometry was used by the main investigator to determine an OSI, after measuring subjective refraction and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and then slitlamp evaluation was carried out by an independent researcher. The surgical decision was based on the current protocol according to the European guidelines. Correlation between the surgical decision, CDVA, and OSI were analyzed and an OSI discriminative value was calculated, implementing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve., RESULTS: The study comprised 106 eyes (73 patients). The analysis established an inverse linear correlation between OSI and CDVA (r = -0.455, P < .0001). The comparison of the mean OSI between the surgical group (7.05 +/- 4.65 [SD]) and the nonsurgical group (2.92 +/- 1.88), revealed statistically significant differences (P = 5.04 x 10-9). The OSI score 3.2 was determined as the optimal cutoff value to discriminate surgical treatment (sensitivity 80%, specificity 84%)., CONCLUSIONS: An optimal OSI value, according to an ROC curve calculation, was capable of providing clinicians with a powerful criterion for preoperative decision-making, thus suggesting an end to the subjectivity implicit in the cataract surgery decision-making process.

517,"A comparison of the semiflexed (MTP) view with the standing extended view (SEV) in the radiographic assessment of knee osteoarthritis in a busy routine X-ray department Objective. To compare the reproducibility of the standing extended view (SEV) (also known as the standing anteroposterior view) with the semiflexed, postero-anterior view [the 'metatarsophalangeal' (MTP)] view for assessing joint space width (JSW) and osteophytes in osteoarthritis of the knee when used in a busy routine X-ray department. Methods. Forty-seven patients (24 men) had both SEV and MTP views taken on the same day in a busy National Health Service radiography department. Repeat views were taken as entirely separate procedures some time over the following 2 weeks, in the same department and with no special arrangements for the selection of radiographers, time of day, or X-ray machine. The first 24 patients had second views in the SEV position whilst the remaining 23 had second MTP views. Radiographs were read independently by two experienced observers who measured JSW with a transparent ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm at the narrowest point in both medial and lateral compartments of the tibiofemoral joint in both knees. Osteophytes were graded 0-2 according to a standard atlas. Ten SEV and 10 MTP radiographs selected randomly were re-read by one observer. Results. Mean (95% confidence interval) JSW in the medial compartment measured on SEV radiographs was 3.54 mm (3.08, 3.99) and on MTP radiographs it was 2.80 mm (2.37, 3.23); in the lateral compartment it was 6.04 mm (5.71, 6.37) when measured on SEV radiographs and 5.47 mm (5.09, 5.85) on MTP radiographs. The estimated variances for the medial compartment were 2.0 mm2 for SEV and 0.2 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001) and for the lateral compartment 1.4 mm2 for SEV and 0.5 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001). The proportion of radiographs for which there was disagreement between observers regarding osteophyte grade was not statistically different between SEV and MTP views (SEV, medial 40%, lateral 44%; MTP, medial 39%, lateral 39%). Conclusions. Even when radiographs are taken in a busy National Health Service radiography department, measurement of JSW from the MTP view is more reproducible than from the SEV view, the MTP view gives a slightly lower measurement of JSW, and there is no advantage in using either view in recording osteophyte grade. We recommend the wider adoption of the MTP method. © British Society for Rheumatology 2004; all rights reserved.",Excluded
162,"Nonlinear interactions of high-frequency oscillations in the human somatosensory system OBJECTIVE: The source of somatosensory evoked high-frequency activity at about 600 Hz is still not completely clear. Hence, we aimed to study the influence of double stimulation on the human somatosensory system by analyzing both the low-frequency activity and the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at about 600 Hz., METHODS: We used median nerve stimulation at seven interstimuli intervals (ISIs) with a high time resolution between 2.4 and 4.8 ms to investigate the N15, N20 and superimposed HFOs. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram and the magnetoencephalogram of 12 healthy participants were recorded. Subsequently, the source analysis of precortical and cortical dipoles was performed., RESULTS: The difference computations of precortical dipole activation curves showed in both the low- and high-frequency range a correlation between the ISI and the latency of the second stimulus response. The cortical low-frequency response showed a similar behavior. Contrarily, in the second response of cortical HFOs this latency shift could not be confirmed. We found amplitude fluctuations that were dependent on the ISI in the low-frequency activity and the HFOs. These nonlinear interactions occurred at ISIs, which differ by one full HFO period (1.6 ms)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency activity and HFOs originate from different generators. Precortical and cortical HFOs are independently generated. The amplitude fluctuations dependent on ISI indicate nonlinear interference between successive stimuli., SIGNIFICANCE: Information processing in human somatosensory system includes nonlinearity.",Excluded

121,"Human dosimetry and preliminary tumor distribution of 18F- fluoropaclitaxel in healthy volunteers and newly diagnosed breast cancer patients using PET/CT 18F-fluoropaclitaxel is a radiolabeled form of paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Preclinical data suggest that 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may be a reasonable surrogate for measuring the uptake of paclitaxel. As a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux pump associated with multidrug resistance, 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may also be useful in identifying multidrug resistance and predicting tumor response for drugs other than paclitaxel. Method(s): After informed consent was obtained, 3 healthy volunteers and 3 patients with untreated breast cancer (neoadjuvant chemotherapy candidates, tumor size > 2 cm) received an intravenous infusion of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and then underwent PET/CT. Healthy volunteers underwent serial whole-body imaging over an approximately 3-h interval, and organ 18F residence times were determined from the time-activity curves uncorrected for decay to determine dosimetry. Radiation dose estimates were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. For breast cancer patients, dynamic imaging of the primary tumor was performed for 60 min, followed by static whole-body scans at 1 and 2 h after injection. Result(s): Dosimetry calculations showed that the gallbladder received the highest dose (229.50 muGy/MBq [0.849 rad/mCi]), followed by the small and large intestines (161.26 muGy/MBq [0.597 rad/mCi] and 184.59 muGy/MBq [0.683 rad/mCi]). The resultant effective dose was 28.79 muGy/MBq (0.107 rem/mCi). At approximately 1 h after injection, an average of 42% of the decay-corrected activity was in the gastrointestinal system, with a mean of 0.01% in the tumor. All 3 breast cancer patients showed retention of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and ultimately demonstrated a complete pathologic response (no invasive cancer in the breast or axillary nodes) to chemotherapy that included a taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel) at surgical resection. The tumor-to-background ratio increased with time to a maximum of 7.7 at 20 min. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of using 18F-fluoropaclitaxel PET/CT tumor imaging and provides radiation dosimetry measurements in humans. Although further study is needed, it is hoped that the measured intratumoral 18F-fluoropaclitaxel distribution can serve as a surrogate for paclitaxel, and potentially other chemotherapeutic agent retention, in solid tumors.

818,"Lateral X-ray for proximal femoral fractures - Is it really necessary? INTRODUCTION: Historically routine work up of a patient with a proximal femoral fracture always included anterior-posterior (AP) and a lateral film of the hip. The aim was to define the role of the lateral X-ray in the assessment and surgical planning of proximal femur fractures., METHODS: Radiographs of 320 consecutive patients with proximal femoral fractures who were admitted over a 12 months period were divided into lateral and AP views. Two blinded reviewers independently assessed the AP view alone and then the AP plus the lateral view. Fracture classification was noted for each X-ray and then compared with intraoperative diagnosis which was our study's gold standard. A 2 x 2 contingency square table and Pearson's x(2) test were used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: The rate of correct classification by the reviewers enhanced by the assessment of the lateral X-ray in addition to the AP view for intracapsular fractures (p = 0.018) but not for extracapsular fractures (p = 0.29). Operative management did not change for intracapsular fractures which appeared displaced on initial AP view after reviewing the lateral X-ray. The only advantage of obtaining a lateral view in intracapsular fracture was the detection of displacement were the fracture appeared to be undisplaced on initial AP view., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides statistical evidence that one view is adequate and safe for majority of proximal femoral fractures. The lateral radiograph should not be performed on a routine basis thus making considerable saving in time and money, and avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure and discomfort to the patient.

297,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

442,"Lung volumes during sustained microgravity on Spacelab SLS-1 Gravity is known to influence the mechanical behavior of the lung and chest wall. However, the effect of sustained microgravity (mu G) on lung volumes has not been reported. Pulmonary function tests were performed by four subjects before, during, and after 9 days of mu G exposure. Ground measurements were made in standing and supine postures. Tests were performed using a bag-in-box-and-flowmeter system and a respiratory mass spectrometer. Measurements included functional residual capacity (FRC), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), residual volume (RV), inspiratory and expiratory vital capacities (IVC and EVC), and tidal volume (VT). Total lung capacity (TLC) was derived from the measured EVC and RV values. With preflight standing values as a comparison, FRC was significantly reduced by 15% (approximately 500 ml) in mu G and 32% in the supine posture. ERV was reduced by 10-20% in mu G and decreased by 64% in the supine posture. RV was significantly reduced by 18% (310 ml) in mu G but did not significantly change in the supine posture compared with standing. IVC and EVC were slightly reduced during the first 24 h of mu G but returned to 1-G standing values within 72 h of mu G exposure. IVC and EVC in the supine posture were significantly reduced by 12% compared with standing. During mu G, VT decreased by 15% (approximately 90 ml), but supine VT was unchanged compared with preflight standing values. TLC decreased by approximately 8% during mu G and in the supine posture compared with preflight standing. The reductions in FRC, ERV, and RV during mu G are probably due to the cranial shift of the diaphragm, an increase in intrathoracic blood volume, and more uniform alveolar expansion.",Excluded

Exposure to sunlight is the primary etiological agent for basal cell carcinoma (BCC)., AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of different ultraviolet (UV) doses on DNA damage in epidermal keratinocytes in vivo and to elucidate if patients with BCC are more susceptible to UV-induced DNA damage in comparison with normal healthy volunteers in response to solar simulator radiation (SSR)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin biopsies obtained post-UV irradiation from both normal healthy volunteers and BCC patients were analyzed for DNA damage, using immunohistochemical approach with TDM-2 antibody, which binds specifically to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimmers (CPDs)., RESULTS: In both normal volunteers and BCC patients, the peak of CPD-positive cells occurred at 4.5 h post-SSR. There was a statistically significant difference in CPD positivity between BCC patients and normal volunteers, at time points (from 4.5 h to 48 h post-SSR). For a given dose of SSR based on each individual minimal erythema dose (MED), a greater number of CPD-positive cells could be shown., CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown for the first time and in vivo in human volunteers that BCC patients are more susceptible to UV-induced DNA damage in comparison with normal healthy volunteers.

741,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
167,"Patterns of relapse and growth kinetics of surgery- and radiation-refractory meningiomas Patients with surgery- and radiation-refractory meningiomas have a poor outcome. Due to our lack of knowledge concerning multi-recurrent meningioma natural history, their clinical course is poorly defined. This retrospective study aims at defining patterns of relapse in order to help in the definition of response criteria in future clinical trials. We performed a retrospective review of surgery- and radiotherapy-refractory meningioma cases with interpretable radiological follow-up treated in our department. Tumor volumes were measured on 3D T1 Gadolinium volumetric sequences using a semi-automated algorithm for tumor segmentation. Twenty nine patients with multi-treated meningioma (11 WHO Grade II, 5 de novo WHO Grade III and 13 transformed WHO Grade III), were evaluated. Median PFS was 16 months for patients with Grade II meningiomas. In patients with Grade III meningiomas, the de novo subgroup had a median PFS of 4 months compared with 7 months in patients with malignant transformation. Volumetric analysis of tumor growth concerned 95 tumor nodules in 50 relapses. The mean growth rate of tumor nodules was 10.4 cm(3)/year (95% CI 7.3-14.8 cm(3)/year). Three patterns of tumor growth were described: classical"" for 9 (31%) patients, ""local multi-nodular"" for 6 (21%) patients and ""multi-nodular metastatic"" for the last 14 (48%) patients.

287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included
619,"Local injection of the 90Y-labelled peptidic vector DOTATOC to control gliomas of WHO grades II and III: an extended pilot study We have previously presented preliminary observations on targeting somatostatin receptor-positive malignant gliomas of all grades by local injection of the radiolabelled peptidic vector 90Y-DOTATOC. We now report on our more thorough clinical experience with this novel compound, focussing on low-grade and anaplastic gliomas. Small peptidic vectors have the potential to target invisible infiltrative disease within normal surrounding brain tissue, thereby opening a window of opportunity for early intervention. Five progressive gliomas of WHO grades II and III and five extensively debulked low-grade gliomas were treated with varying fractions of 90Y-DOTATOC. The vectors were locally injected into the resection cavity or into solid tumour. The activity per single injection ranged from 555 to 1,875 MBq, and the cumulative activity from 555 to 7,030 MBq, according to tumour volumes and eloquence of the affected brain area, yielding dose estimates from 76+/-15 to 312+/-62 Gy. Response was assessed by the clinical status, by steroid dependence and, every 4-6 months, by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. In the five progressive gliomas, lasting responses were obtained for at least 13-45 months without the need for steroids. Radiopeptide brachytherapy had been the only modality applied to counter tumour progression. Interestingly, we observed the slow transformation of a solid, primarily inoperable anaplastic astrocytoma into a resectable multi-cystic lesion 2 years after radiopeptide brachytherapy. Based on these observations, we also assessed the feasibility of local radiotherapy following extensive debulking, which was well tolerated. Targeted beta-particle irradiation based on diffusible small peptidic vectors appears to be a promising modality for the treatment of malignant gliomas.",Excluded

No difference in survival was identified between the two arms. This secondary analysis was performed to examine the relationship between patient age and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-six patients were randomized to receive etoposide plus cisplatin and either RT qd or split-course RT bid. This retrospective study compared the outcomes of patients aged >/=70 years (elderly patients"") with those of younger individuals. Of the 244 assessable patients, 63 (26%) were elderly, and 181 (74%) were younger individuals. RESULT(S): The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 39% and 18%, respectively, in patients younger than 70 years, compared with 36% and 13%, respectively, in elderly patients (P =.4). Grade 4+ toxicity occurred in 62% of patients younger than 70 years compared with 81% of elderly patients (P =.007). Grade 4+ hematologic toxicity occurred in 56% of patients younger than 70 years, compared with 78% of elderly patients (P =.003). Grade 4+ pneumonitis occurred in 1% of those younger than 70 years, compared with 6% of elderly patients (P =.02). CONCLUSION(S): Toxicity, especially myelosuppression and pneumonitis, was more pronounced in the elderly patients receiving combined-modality therapy for locally advanced NSCLC. Despite increased toxicity, elderly patients have survival rates equivalent to younger individuals. Therefore, fit, elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC should be encouraged to receive combined-modality therapy, preferably on clinical trials with cautious, judicious monitoring. Future studies should explore ways to decrease toxicity of therapy in elderly patients.""",Excluded
795,"Baseline analysis of use of denosumab in osteoporotic patients: Indications, compliance, adverse effect and tolerability Background Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone loss. In the UK, use of denosumab was approved by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from October 2010 (TA204) [1]. Denosumab was used in Rheumatology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London from October 2010. Objectives We audited the indications for use of denosumab in these patients. Drug compliance, adverse effect and tolerability of the drug were also analysed. Methods 81 patients (female 77, male 4, age range 52 to 92 years, mean age 72 years) who commenced denosumab between October 2010 and December 2011 were identified retrospectively. 97% (79/81) of the patients come from their own home and 3% (2/81) come from nursing home. Patients' demographics, risk factors, fracture history, bone mineral density (BMD), spine and hip T score and previous osteoporosis treatment were assessed. 58 patients had follow up data and renal function was monitored every six months. Side effects were documented. Results Pre-treatment Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was available on all patients (mean BMD spine and hip 0.686 gm/cm2 and 0.705 gm/cm2, mean T score spine and hip -3.025 and -1.776). 87% (75/81) had failed treatment with both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. 11% (9/81) had breast cancer and were on aromatase inhibitors. 16% (13/81) had mild renal impairment and 7% (6/81) had moderate renal impairment at the base line. 35.8% (29/81) of patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency at baseline and were treated. 9% (7/81) were on denosumab treatment for primary prevention of osteoporosis (T score range -2.3 to -4.1). All of these had failed oral medication previously. Four patients swapped from intravenous Ibandronate due to poor venous access. Use of denosumab was indicated clinically despite lack of specific risk factors suggested by NICE. All patients treated with denosumab for secondary prevention of osteoporosis (91%,74/81) met NICE criteria by virtue of previous fracture and failure of other treatments.

15,"Radioembolization of symptomatic, unresectable neuroendocrine hepatic metastases using yttrium-90 microspheres PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, efficacy, and symptom-control of radioembolization in patients with unresectable liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETLMs)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age of 62 years) with treatment-refractory NETLMs underwent radioembolization using yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres. Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded
597,"Association between radiation dose and pathological complete response after preoperative radiochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer Aim: This study was undertaken to examine the impact of radiation dose on pathological complete response (pCR) rates following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (N-RCT) for squamous cell esophageal cancer (ESCC). Patients and Methods: From 1988 to 2011, 218 patients were treated with 30-30.6 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction), 39.6-40 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) or 44-45 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) and concomitant cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin + 5-FU or 5-FU alone. The most commonly used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-FU-Alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day during the whole course of treatment (n=111). To eliminate the dispersing effect of potentially different efficacy levels of these drug regimens on pCR, we excluded patients with regimens other than 5-FU-Alone. Result(s): Histomorphological regression grade 1a (0% residual tumor), 1b (<10% residual tumor), 2 (10-50% residual tumor) and 3 (>50% residual tumor) was observed in 26 (23%), 24 (22%), 36 (32%) and 25 (23%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 9 out of 71 (13%) patients treated with 30 Gy-30.6 Gy, 13 of 34 (38%) patients treated with 39.6-40 Gy and 4 of 6 (67%) patients treated with 44-45 Gy (p=0.001). Median follow-up time from the start of N-RCT was 191 months (range=2-262 months). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 33% for the whole cohort. OS at 5 years was 58% for patients with pCR compared to 25% for patients with less favorable response to N-RCT (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion(s): The dose of radiation correlates significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR in stage II/III squamous cell esophageal cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are required to definitively evaluate the impact of application of higher radiation doses on efficacy and safety/tolerability in the context of N-RCT on the clinical outcomes.",Excluded
8,"Protection from free radical formation on the scalp Hair is a protective barrier for the body against external aggressors such as solar radiation. People with bald scalps or thinning hair do not benefit from this protective barrier. It is known that solar exposure can induce oxidative stress to the skin; however not many studies have examined the potential for oxidative damage to the scalp. Free radicals produced by these stressors can lead to the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMP's and the breakdown of collagen and elastin. They can also inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in hair follicles. In order to determine whether scalp skin is a potential target of oxidative stress, we developed a non-invasive method to assess the generation of free radicals from measuring the chemiluminescence signal in skin. Significant free-radical production was detected from the scalp after exposure to dose of visible light (400-700nm). Traditional sunscreens block only the UV (290-400um) wavelengths of solar light, leaving the longer wavelengths to stimulate and produce free radicals in the skin. A photostable UVA/UVB sunscreen combined with a triple combination of natural antioxidants including a Parthenolide- free Feverfew Extract, a natural extract known to be a potent antioxidant, was developed to reduce the production of free radicals from the scalp. Topical application of the triple antioxidant sunscreen significantly reduced the amount of generated free radicals on the scalp. These results demonstrate that the scalps of men and women with thinning to bald scalps are a potential target of oxidative damage. Excessive damage to the hair follicle could lead to decreased proliferation and be a contributing factor to hair loss. This study suggests the need for a sunscreen with potent antioxidants to protect the scalp from the free radical induced damage from solar exposure.",Excluded
101,"Dynamic hybrid synthesis in the treatment of lumbosacral pathology: Preliminary experience with dto Introduction: Adult patients suffering from degenerative lumbosacral pathology may present different stages of mechanical alteration of the tripod joint in contiguous levels and in selected cases may be considered for associate a instrumented arthrodesis of unstable segment and systems that aim at restoring the physiological movement of the minor symptomatic instability or to prevent junctional disorders in the presence of risk factors in imaging. After a long experience with the Dynesys in treatment of degenerative instability of lumbar spine authors report their experience and preliminary results of a new hybrid system of dynamic stabilization and fusion which has two solutions with a single online system, the Dynesys system to Optima (DTO Zimmer Spine). Material(s) and Method(s): At the Department of Orthopedic A.S.U.S. Giovanni Battista Molinette of Turin since 3-2008 to 12-2009 17 patients with lumbosacral degenerative pathology were surgically treated, 7 males, 10 females, mean age 51 (35-69). All complained of low back pain (VAS 8) with radicular pain in 9 (VAS 7) and claudicazio in 8, ODI 53 %, in 9 patients imaging showed instability in adjacent segments of lumbar stenosis, in 6 junctional dynamic stenosis results of instrumented L4-L5 fusion, one case with 2degree grade L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had degenerative changes at higher levels, one case of pseudoarthrosis in fusion of L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had junctional instability. Dynamic synthesis has always included a single proximal segment of the instrumented fusion area which extended distally in S1 in 15 cases, in L5 in 2 cases (L5 sacralised). In 11 cases direct decompression was performed within the stenosis area (3 revisions of previous decompression), in 6 cases with functional stenosis indirect decompression was performed by disc-ligament tension with Dynesys. All patients have worn a lumbar corset for 2 months. One case needed revision surgery for a misplaced screw after 7 days. Result(s): For an average f. up 32 months (43-12), back pain almost improved in all patients a VAS 3 (2-6), 12 % ODI. The neurological impairment resolved in all patients (VAS 1). Patients with spondylolisthesis concerned of pain in the iliac crest donor side and higher back pain for insufficient proximal extension of the dynamic synthesis. Good fusion was observed on the X-ray in all cases of the instrumented area, we have not seen any hardware failure nor pedicular screws mobilisation or periprosthetic osteolysis and junctional disorders. Conclusion(s): The experience is short and requires a longer f. up but good clinical results encourage the application of the system in selected cases, often in young adults. This hybrid synthesis does not lengthen the operative time for ease assembly and provides the benefits of limiting the extent of fusion which is coupled to a dynamic system of proven efficacy on adjacent levels reducing the probability of occurrence of future junctional diseases.",Excluded
487,"Radioprotection of hematopoietic stem cells by interleukin-1 Radioprotective agents such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), when given prior to irradiation, protect animals from radiation damage. However, in vivo administration of these cytokines does not allow one to determine whether the protective effects act directly on the hematopoietic system. In the present study, we subjected male bone marrow cells to in vitro treatment with IL-1 prior to irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. We found that male bone marrow cells pretreated with IL-1 prior to irradiation increased the survival of irradiated female recipient mice when compared with nontreated irradiated marrow cells. In addition, irradiated female recipients that received IL-1-pretreated male donor bone marrow cells displayed an increased presence of male donor cells in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus for up to 3 months posttransplant. Furthermore, serial transplantation studies revealed that male cells could only be detected in tertiary female recipients who received bone marrow from mice transplanted with IL-1-treated cells. These results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment protects both short-term and long-term repopulating stem cells from an irradiation insult and that these cells are capable of reconstituting the myeloid and lymphoid organs of recipient mice.",Excluded
930,"Quantification of coronary artery calcium on the basis of dual-energy coronary CT angiography PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using virtual noncontrast material-enhanced (VNC) computed tomographic (CT) series derived from dual-energy CT imaging studies for coronary artery calcium quantification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved; all patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

Therefore, we studied these effects in 18 male rabbits that were randomly divided into phone and control groups. Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.",Excluded
326,"Radiosurgical decompression of metastatic epidural compression BACKGROUND: Surgical decompression of metastatic epidural compression (MEC) improved ambulatory function. Spine radiosurgery can accurately target the epidural tumor and deliver high radiation doses for tumor control. Therefore, a clinical trial was performed to quantitatively determine the degree of epidural decompression by radiosurgery of metastatic epidural compression. METHOD(S): Sixty-two patients with a total of 85 lesions of metastatic epidural compression were treated. Epidural compression was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Main criteria of inclusion were neurological status with muscle power 4 of 5 or better. Radiosurgery was performed to the involved spine segment, including the epidural mass with median dose of 16 Gy (range 12-20 Gy) in a single session. All patients had prospective clinical follow-up, ranging from 1-48 months (median 11.5 months), and 36 patients had pretreatment and post-treatment imaging, ranging from 2-33 months (median 9.3 months). Primary endpoints were epidural tumor control and thecal sac decompression. RESULT(S): The mean epidural tumor volume reduction was 65 +/- 14% at 2 months after radiosurgery. The epidural tumor area at the level of the most severe spinal cord compression was 0.82 +/- 0.08 cm2 before radiosurgery and 0.41 +/- 0.06 cm2 after radiosurgery (P < .001). Thecal sac patency improved from 55 +/- 4% to 76 +/- 3% (P < .001). Overall, neurological function improved in 81%. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrated a radiosurgical decompression of epidural tumor. Although neurosurgical decompression and radiotherapy is the standard treatment in patients with good performance, radiosurgical decompression can be a viable noninvasive treatment option for malignant epidural compression. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

The examinations were performed at a pre-selected tube potential using automatic brightness control which varied the screening current to keep the dose rate at the image intensifier input surface constant. It may be deduced from the results that there is a significant difference in mean radiation dose between the two rooms.

600,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE. In 1 case, presenting C7 ABC, an Halo Vest was necessary for 30 days, being substituted by a Minerva plaster for three months. 19 patient on 20 are classified as NED (no evidence of disease) at the last F.U. 1 patient as AWD (alive with disease). Discussione e conclusioni: ABC is a benign lesion but in some cases can be locally aggressive causing pain, loss of function, spinal cord, nerve roots or cauda equina compression and pathological fractures. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) was used first as adjuvant procedure to reduce bleeding during surgery. First, De Rosa in 1990 treated ABC using embolization only. Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded
268,"Influence of C-reactive protein levels and age on the value of D-dimer in diagnosing pulmonary embolism Background: Recently, the number of performed CT-angiographies to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE) rised markedly, while the incidence of PE hardly increased. This low yield of CT-angiography leads to more patients exposed to radiation and higher costs. Aim(s): The diagnostic value of age, C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer in PE was investigated. Additionally an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level [age-adjusted cutoff = age/100 mg/L] was compared with the conventional cutoff level in diagnosing PE for patients >=50 yr. Method(s): This observational study (2004-2007) included all consecutive patients suspected for PE presenting on the emergency department with a performed CT-angiography after measuring CRP and D-dimer levels. Result(s): Of 4609 patients suspected for PE, 1164 patients underwent CT-angiography of whom 309 (26.5%) had PE. Correlation between CRP and D-dimer was 0.42 (P < 0.001). D-dimer and age correlated positively (rs = 0.33, P < 0.001), but only in patients >50 yr and independent of PE. Multivariate regression analysis showed significant contribution of age, D-dimer and age-adjusted D-dimer for diagnosing PE, but not for CRP. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff value increased specificity from 37% to 50%, whereas sensitivity declined from 96% to 90%. Applying this age-adjusted cutoff level in patients >=70 yr, specificity increased from 18% to 40%, while sensitivity decreased from 96% to 88%. Conclusion(s): In the prediction of PE, age and D-dimer levels are relevant, while CRP level is not. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in older patients remarkably improves the specificity of D-dimer testing with a minor decline in sensitivity. This may increase the yield of CT-angiography in diagnosing PE. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
345,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded
157,"Brain perfusion SPECT in patients with chronic adult hydrocephalus syndrome. Pre- and post-surgical study Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize regional cerebral blood flow in patients with Adult Hydrocephalus Syndrome (AHS) and to evaluate the changes in brain perfusion after surgical derivation treatment. Patients and Methods: 20 patients with AHS (age: 72 +/- 14, 12 men) were studied before and six months after surgery. All patients underwent a brain perfusion SPECT (99mTc-HMPAO) prior to surgery and at 6 months post-surgery. Semi-quantitative analysis was done for brain uptake: 0 = Normal, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe, 4 = No uptake. The severity of ventricular dilatation was assessed by classifying the intensity and extension of subcortical defects: 0 = Normal, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe. The scores of the pre- and post-surgical studies were compared using the Student-t test. Result(s): A global reduction of brain uptake was observed (mean score 12.85), mainly in frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, with a significant improvement in post surgical studies (mean score 6, p < 0,001). After surgery, 16 (80 %) of the 20 patients improved brain uptake. In relationship to subcortical uptake, 5 patients showed mild defects, 9 moderate defects and 6 patients presented severe uptake reduction. In post-surgical studies 15 (75%) patients improved almost one degree in the subcortical score and 65 % of the patients showed a normal or mild subcortical uptake reduction.

596,"Comparison of muscle area and strength between OA knees with and without structural progression - Data from the OA initiative Purpose: Quadriceps strength was observed to protect against the onset of symptomatic knee OA, but whether it protects against structural progression of knee OA once it is established radiographically, is currently unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether baseline or two-year changes in anatomical muscle cross sectional areas (ACSAs) of the quadriceps (heads), hamstrings, and adductors, and/or muscle strength of the extensor and flexors differ between OA knees with structural progression (cartilage loss in MRI and joint space width loss in X-rays) compared with OA knees without structural progression. Method(s): A subcohort of the OA Initiative was used, for which baseline and one-year follow up (FU) quantitative MRI analysis on cartilage thickness was available in one knee (n=719). Of these, n=561 also had quantitative measurement of radiographic joint space width (JSW) at baseline and at one year follow-up, and central X-ray readings from fixed flexion radiographs (public-use data sets 0.E.1/3.E.1). From these, we identified those with structural progression in the medial femorotibial compartment according to both MRI and radiographic JSW, using the smallest detectable change method (n=46). Of those, we included 41 with KLG2 or 3, of which n=23 had axial T1-weighted SE images of the thigh at baseline and 2 year follow-up as well as muscle strength measurement (Isometric chair, Metitur Oy, Jyvaskyla, Finland). For 20 of these we were able to match controls with no progression in either MRI or JSW, with the same sex and KLG, with a body height within 3cm and a BMI within 5kg/m2, and with a WOMAC pain score within 5 (of 20) units. Public use MRI data (T1-weighted spin echo sequence/0.E.1/3.E.1) and custom software were used to determine the ACSAs and signal intensities of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and adductors in an axial image located at 33% of the femoral length (distal to proximal; location estimated based on body height). The four quadriceps heads were analyzed in an axial image slice located at 30% femoral length. Baseline and follow-up data were analyzed independently. A paired t-test was used to compare measurements in progressors vs. nonprogressors. Result(s): Cases with MRI and X-ray progression (age 63.1+/-7.8 y) and controls without progression (age 65.8+/-10.0 y) consisted of 12 women and 8 men, respectively. Progressors did not show significantly smaller baseline total quadriceps, specific quadriceps heads, flexor, or adductor ACSAs, or significantly smaller extensor and flexor strength than matched controls (Table 1). (Table presented) Further, no differences in the mean or SD signal intensity in any of the muscle regions were noted at baseline (data not shown). Changes in ACSAs over 2 years also did not significantly differ between progressor and non-progressor knees (Table 1). When stratifying comparisons for cases with little baseline pain (WOMAC score of 0-1; n=7) vs. those with a score of 5-8 (n=8), the findings were similar (data not shown). Conclusion(s): Progressor (case) and non-progressor (control) knees in this study were carefully selected from a large subsample, based on two independent measures of structural OA progression (MRI cartilage loss and JSW reduction in X-rays). Further, cases and controls were carefully matched for measures known to be associated with progression or with muscle area. The results of this exploratory study do not provide support that, once radiographic knee OA is established, baseline or longitudinal changes in thigh muscle ACSAs or strength predict (or are associated) with structural progression.",Excluded

The high latitude (70 degrees N) of the observation site provided natural laboratory"" conditions to look at the occurrence of LOCH with high and low UV-radiation levels, which occurred during summers and winters, respectively. The diagnostic criterion for LOCH was acute haze of grade > or =2 occurring between 4 and 12 months postoperatively., RESULTS: The follow-up ranged from 12 to 41 months. Of the 314 eyes that met the inclusion criteria, 11 developed LOCH when the environmental UV-radiation level was high. No eye developed LOCH when the level was low. The correlation between a high level of environmental UV radiation and the occurrence of LOCH was statistically significant (P =.001)., CONCLUSION: Environments with high UV-radiation levels may increase the risk of LOCH after PRK in eyes with moderate to high myopia. Use of UV-protective eyewear should be encouraged during the first year after PRK.""",Excluded

Since June 2003, we have applied our conventional protocol for evaluation of cerebral blood perfusion during interventional radiology (IVR) procedures. We reviewed our experience using the IVR-CT/angio system and investigated the efficacy and limitations of this technique. No complications relating to radiation exposure, contrast medium use, or IVR procedures were observed. CT perfusion was useful for detecting cerebral perfusion impairment during IVR procedures. This was helpful in deciding the postoperative management. Because patients do not need to be transported to another radiographic suite to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion, the IVR-CT/angio system is ideal for safely and simply detecting cerebral perfusion defects during IVR procedures. However, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient indication for the procedure, because radiation exposure and the amount of contrast medium use are increased if the IVR procedures become difficult.",Excluded

(Table Presented) Methods We measured body composition by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DXA in 194 Chinese stratified for sex, age and body mass index. The equation of prediction was generated by linear regression. The agreement between measured and predicted SM mass was assessed by the use of intraclass correlation analysis, paired t test, Bland-Altman plot. Results The total body SM mass measured by MRI (18.1 +/- 4.8 kg) was closely correlated with ALST mass (19.4 +/- 4.7 kg), with a correlation coefficient of 0.95, 0.84 and 0.89 in all subjects, men and women, respectively. If the previously published equations were used, the difference of SM mass measured by MRI and estimated from ALST was 3.37 +/- 1.75 kg and 3.25 +/- 1.70 kg in the absence and presence of age in the equation, respectively. On the basis of our own data, we generated 2 equations without or with age: SM = 0.98*ALST-0.99 (R2 = 0.91, P < 0.0001) and SM = 0.97* ALST-0.03*Age 0.66 (R2 = 0.92, P < 0.0001). By the application of these equations, the difference between measured and estimated SM mass decreased to -0.05 +/- 1.46 kg and -0.03 +/- 1.39 kg, respectively. (Figure Presented) Conclusions Estimation of SM mass by ALST is plausible, but requires population-specific equations of prediction. Our equations should be validated in other studies in Chinese.",Excluded

551,"Coronary radiation therapy with liquid rhenium-186: a first clinical experience BACKGROUND: Coronary radiation therapy (CRT) is a new, attractive approach for the treatment and prevention of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The RadioCath device consists of a standard balloon dilatation catheter that can be charged with a solution of sodium 186Re perrhenate, a predominant beta emitter. The safety and performance of this new device was evaluated in a pilot trial., METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with a de novo lesion in a native coronary artery were treated with the RadioCath device after successful angioplasty. The average dwell time to deliver a dose of 20 Gy at 0.5 mm into the vessel wall was 418+/-64 seconds. The treatment was well tolerated by most of the patients. In 79%, only one inflation cycle was required to deliver the prescribed dose. There were two procedural device-related complications (5.9%) and three minor procedural related in-hospital complications (9%)., CONCLUSIONS: CRT using a balloon catheter device, charged with a sodium 186Re perrhenate solution, seems feasible and safe. Clinical and angiographic 6-month follow-up data are pending.",Excluded
853,"Spin echo functional MRI in bilateral auditory cortices at 7T: An application of B1 shimming Ultra high fields (UHF) permit unprecedented explorations of functional organizations and insight into basic neuronal processes. Increases in the signal and contrast to noise ratios have allowed increases in the spatial resolution of T2* weighted gradient echo (GE) echo planar imaging (EPI). Furthermore, while the use of T2 weighted imaging methods at UHF (e.g. spin echo (SE) EPI, gradient and spin echo (GRASE) EPI) can also permit higher resolution images, they in addition allow for increased spatial specificity of functional responses, permitting the in-vivo study of functional organizations down to the columnar level of the cortex. The study of the visual cortex has, thus far, benefitted the most from higher resolution T2 weighted studies as achieving the required transmit B1 magnitude at 7T is more challenging in other brain regions, such as the auditory cortex. As such, auditory fMRI studies at UHF have been limited to T2* weighted GE sequences. Recent advances in multi-channel RF transmission (e.g. B1 shimming) have enabled procedures to efficiently address deficiencies in transmit B1 profiles. However, these techniques, shown to be advantageous in anatomical imaging at UHF, are not generally utilized to facilitate T2 weighted fMRI studies.Here we investigate the feasibility of applying B1 shimming to achieve efficient RF transmission in the human auditory cortex. We demonstrate that, with B1 shimming, functional responses to simple tones and to complex sounds (i.e. voices, speech, animal cries, tools and nature) can be efficiently measured with T2 weighted SE-EPI in the bilateral human auditory cortex at 7T without exceeding specific absorption rate (SAR) limits. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
262,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively easier"" it is to exercise.""",Excluded
463,"Postoperative radio-chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric cancer Background: Overall 5 years survival for surgically excised gastric cancer is 30%. Adjuvant treatment may improve the surgical results. Aim(s): To assess treatment results and toxicity in patients with surgically excised gastric cancer, treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant continuous 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Material(s) and Method(s): Forty one patients aged 32 to 73 years (29 males) with stage II-IVA gastric cancer, subjected to a total or subtotal gastrectomy and D2 nodal dissection between 1997 to 2006, were studied. They received adjuvant radiotherapy to the gastric bed and draining lymphatic nodes in a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and chemotherapy with continuous infusion 5-FU, 200 mg/m2/day. Results were compared to historical controls matched according to demographic parameters and tumor characteristics. Result(s): Eighteen patients were in stage II, 10 in stage IIIA, nine in stage IIIB and four in stage IVA. Twelve patients had an N0 nodal status, 15 were N1, nine were N2 and five were N3. After a mean follow up of 32 months, 26 patients (63%) were alive. Five year overall survival was 49.6% for surgery plus radiochemotherapy compared to 30.7% for the historical group subjected only to surgery (p =0.002). Radiotherapy was associated with grade 1-2 toxicity and treatment was completed without interruptions in all patients. Chemotherapy was delayed temporarily in 3 patients.

831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

454,"Residential radon exposure and lung cancer--an epidemiological study of Norwegian municipalities The study is based on a collaboration between the Cancer Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, and National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, UK). The association between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer was studied in 427 municipalities. NRPB detectors were sent to 10,000 households, and 7,500 of the detectors were returned. Data from a nation-wide survey of smoking habits in 1964-1965 were available. Data on asbestos exposure were also used in a regression analysis. The reporting to the Cancer Registry of all new cases of cancer is fairly complete, as hospital departments and institutes of pathology are obliged to report all cancer cases. The histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were grouped into squamous-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and other or non-specified histological types. The age-adjusted rate of lung cancer by histological type was the dependent variable in the regression analysis. A consistent increase in incidence of lung cancer was seen with increasing tobacco consumption, but no positive trend could be shown with increasing radon exposure in the descriptive presentation of the data. In the regression analysis, however, the incidence of small-cell anaplastic lung tumors in females increased significantly with increasing radon exposure. When based on the regression coefficients, the fraction of lung cancers attributable to radon is about 2-4%. However, systematic errors cannot be excluded in an ecological study such as presented here.",Excluded
176,"The increased use of computed tomography scanning for diagnosing superficial soft tissue infections: A disturbing trend of increased radiation with no benefit Background: Soft tissue infections have historically been diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. A trend toward the increased use of computed tomographic (CT) imaging in their evaluation has been noted. Method(s): A retrospective review was performed of soft tissue infection admissions in 2003 and 2004 and in 2009 and 2010. Intracavitary abscesses (eg, intra-abdominal, pelvic) that would not be evident on physical examination were excluded. Demographic and outcome variables, number of CT scans by body region, and total effective radiation dose were recorded. Radiation exposure was stratified into low, moderate, high, and very high categories. Result(s): There was a significant increase in the number of patients receiving <1 CT scan for initial diagnosis, from 36.7% in the early cohort to 50% in the later cohort (P <.001). The mean cumulative effective dose increased from 5.46 to 7.82 mSv (P =.007). Greater proportions of patients fell into the moderate (32.9% vs 24.5%) and high (6.8% vs 10.6%) radiation exposure categories.

934,"The role of curative radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer From 1963-1974, 141 patients with lung cancer were treated with curative intent in the A. Maxwell Evans Clinic in Vancouver. The clinical presentation, age and sex distribution, histology, and reasons for surgery not being carried out are examined. The results of this treatment are presented. An attempt has been made to isolate a group of patients who have a better prognosis so that treatment selection can be improved. Hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, and incidental finding on routine chest x-ray were the most common manner of presentation. Thirty-four percent of the patients were over 70 years of age and 13% were women. The crude overall three- and five-year survival rates were 18 and 10% (19 and 9% in the men, 17 and 14% in the women). Patients presenting with dyspnea had a better survival than those presenting with cough and hemoptysis. Patients with lesions less than 3 cm in diameter had a 28% three-year survival, compared with 14% for lesions greater than 5 cm in diameter. The three- and five-year survival rates in patients over 70 years of age were 23 and 17% respectively. The response to treatment and the survival was better in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Twenty-two percent were alive at three years and 12% at five years as compared with 9 and 5% for other histologies.

Any correlation between clinical prognosis and pathologic component is not clear. We analyzed the prognoses of patients with meningiomas with a rhabdoid or papillary component compared to those of patients with anaplastic meningiomas. From 1994 to June 2013, 14 anaplastic meningiomas, 6 meningiomas with a rhabdoid component, and 5 meningiomas with papillary component were pathologically diagnosed. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, extent of removal, adjuvant treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and pathologic features of 14 anaplastic meningiomas (group A), 5 meningiomas with a predominant (>=50%) papillary or rhabdoid component (group B1), and 6 meningiomas without a predominant (<50%) rhabdoid or papillary component (group B2). Homogeneous enhancement on MRI was associated with improved PFS compared to heterogeneous enhancement (p=0.025). Depending on pathology, the mean PFS was 134.9+/-31.6 months for group A, 46.6+/-13.4 months for group B1, and 118.7+/-19.2 months for group B2. The mean OS was 138.5+/-24.6 months for group A and 59.7+/-16.8 months for group B1. All recurrent tumors were of the previously diagnosed pathology, except for one tumor from group B1, which recurred as an atypical meningioma without a papillary component. Group B1 tumors showed a more aggressive behavior than group B2 tumors.

0,Efficacy of radiation therapy for the treatment of macroscopic canine oral soft tissue sarcoma This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p=0.2292).

755,"Using low pressure, NPWT for wound preparation & the management of split-thickness skin grafts in 3 patients with complex wound The use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is well established in the management of hard-to-heal wounds. One institution, familiar with NPWT's capabilities as well as its shortcomings (eg, pain at dressing changes and pain with the maximum recommended setting of 125 mm Hg), sought a viable alternative. A low pressure, negative pressure wound therapy (LP-NPWT) system, using subatmospheric pressure levels of 75 mm Hg and a low-adherence dressing, was evaluated to prepare the wound bed for split-thickness skin graft (STSG) on three patients. One patient was a healthy 23-year-old man with extensive trauma-related soft tissue wounds. The two women--54 and 47 years old--had multiple comorbidities. One had a lower extremity fasciotomy wound and the other had a dehisced surgical wound with a history of irradiation. Wound area was reduced >60% in all three wounds in 3 to 6 weeks as new granulation tissue developed. The average pain reported was moderate (4 to 5 on a Visual Analogue Scale), ranging from 2 to 10 during dressing changes to 1 to 7 between dressing changes; pain levels reported tended to decrease as therapy progressed. Little or no trauma on dressing removal and no signs of infection were noted. In all cases, STSGs, followed by 4 days of LP-NPWT were applied and all wounds healed. The results from these three cases suggest that the LP-NPWT system is a useful healing adjunct for complex wound bed preparation and graft management. Clinical studies to quantify the effects of LP-NPWT technology and compare its safety and efficacy to other negative pressure systems are needed.",Excluded

945,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included
193,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included

Primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of pemetrexed. Patients and Materials: Patients with unresected stage III NSCLC, planned V20<=35%, and FEV>=1.3L, were treated every 21 days for 2 cycles (pemetrexed 500mg/m2; cisplatin 75mg/m2), followed by 2 cycles of concurrent CT-RT: pemetrexed starting dose was 400mg/m2, escalated up to 800mg/m2 per 100mg/m2 dose level (DL), cisplatin at 75mg/m2 and RT at fixed dose of 66Gy/33 fractions. Result(s): Nine of 10 enrolled patients (age range 46-68 years; 6 men; ECOG PS 0 [6 patients], PS 1 [4]; stage IIIA [1], IIIB [9]; 6 adenocarcinomas, 3 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 large cell carcinoma) were entered on 3 DLs. Dose escalation of pemetrexed was conducted up to 600mg/m2 based on the independent safety monitoring board recommendation. One dose-limiting toxicity occurred at DL3: Grade 4 septic shock. Grade 3 related toxicities: 2 neutropenia at DL3, 2 lymphopenia per DL (3 recurrent), 2 leukopenia (1 recurrent) at DL3, 1 gastric pain (DL3), 1 nausea and 1 recurrent vomiting (DL2). No Grade 3/4 radiation-related toxicities were observed. No toxic death was observed. Disease control rate was 77.7% (1 CR, 4 PR, 2 SD). One-year survival rate was 90%. Conclusion(s): This phase I report of pemetrexed is dedicated to NSCLC with induction therapy and fixed high-dose RT. Pemetrexed at 500mg/m2, concurrently given with cisplatin and RT was well tolerated and appears to be the only third-generation agent that can likely be recommended safely at full dose in future trials with concurrent RT. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

632,"Radiation exposure of patients and staff working in angiography and interventional radiology unit Catheter angiography and interventional radiologic procedures are the medical applications with the highest exposure to radiation. The projection used, in other words the irradiated region of the patient, constantly changes and the change in irradiation geometry due to the movements of the image amplifier is another important factor. Irradiation can be achieved in the form of continuous (fluoroscopic) or sequential static images (filming). In these irradiations the kVp, mA and irradiation time of the system change continuously depending on the patient thickness. The aim of this study was to determine the dose of radiation the staff working in Angiography and Interventional Radiology unit and the patients undergoing intervention were exposed to and to discuss the measures to decrease the dose of radiation. In this study, the dose values of 129 patients and three physicians and two radiotechnologists working in the unit were determined. In order to evaluate the radiation doses of the employees, radiation doses were measured with Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dosimeters over a period of six months. Doses of the patients during the procedure were measured separately. Total bimonthly and annual dose amounts were determined for the physicians as chest (collar), belt and wrist with the help of OSL dosimeters. Likewise, total bimonthly and annual dose amounts of radiotechnologists were measured as breast (neck) and belt. It was found that the duration of fluoroscopy was 2-3 times higher in radiological procedures than in diagnostic angiography and therefore the patient and radiologist were exposed to more radiation.

1232,"Biodosimetry for high dose accidental exposures by drug induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) assay The conventional dicentric assay does not provide an accurate dose estimate in the case of accidental exposure to ionizing radiation above 6 Gy due to mitotic delay and poor mitotic index. The present study aims to establish a simple and rapid dose assessment technique based on scoring of rings and fragments in PCC spreads of stimulated lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were gamma irradiated to different doses (6.2-24.5 Gy), cultured for two days with PHA and were forced to condense prematurely using 500 nM Okadaic acid (OA). The chromosome spreads were prepared, stained with Giemsa and observed under a microscope. The PCC index, PCC rings, and PCC fragments were scored for each dose point to arrive at the dose effect curve for various end points such as induction of rings and fragments and dicentrics. The PCC index varied from 12-18% up to 18 Gy and thereafter dropped to 6-8% at higher doses. The dose dependent increase in rings and fragments was found to be linear with a slope of 0.054+/-0.001 Gy(-1) for rings and 0.45+/-0.03 Gy(-1) for PCC fragments. An experiment was carried out to simulate partial-body exposure by mixing 10 Gy in vitro irradiated blood with un-irradiated blood in different proportions. The ratio of frequency of damaged cells among the total number of cells analyzed was found to be a good index of partial-body exposure. The culture duration was extended to 72 h to overcome the cell cycle delay induced by high doses of radiation. The conventional dicentrics rings and fragments also showed a dose response at high doses. The response can be best fitted to a linear model with a slope of 0.28+/-0.0007 Gy(-1) for the induction of dicentrics. However, long culture duration, technical skill and time required to analyse multi-aberrant cells makes the dicentric assay less suitable for high dose exposures requiring a rapid dose estimate. The PCC assay can be performed in 50 h with biodosimetric information about the irradiated fraction in cases of acute radiation exposures. The automated finding of PCC spreads significantly increased the speed of scoring PCC fragments. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Simultaneously, with the augmentation on each side a microimplant was placed vertically from the top of the alveolar crest penetrating the residual bone and the grafting material. Eight months after initial surgery the microimplants were retrieved with a surrounding bone core. The composition of residual graft material and surrounding bone was analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy., RESULTS: Residual graft material of both types was present as 10-500 mum particles in direct contact with, or completely surrounded by, newly formed bone; smaller particles were also present in non-mineralized tissue. In the case of BCP the bone-graft substitute interface showed evidence of superficial disintegration of particles into individual grains. Median Ca/P ratios (at.%), determined from >200 discreet sites within residual graft particles and adjacent bone, were: DBB: 1.61 (confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.64); BCP: 1.5 (CI 1.45-1.52); DBB-augmented bone: 1.62 (CI 1.59-1.66); BCP-augmented bone: 1.52 (CI 1.47-1.55); P=0.028 for DBB vs. BCP and DBB- vs. BCP-augmented bone. The reduction in Ca/P ratio for BCP over the healing period is consistent with the dissolution of beta-TCP and reprecipitation on the surface of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite., CONCLUSION: The beta-TCP component of BCP may be gradually substituted by calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite over the healing period. This process and superficial degranulation of BCP particles may influence the progress of resorption and healing.",Excluded

In the assessment of stent restenosis compared with CA on per-stent basis, there was no significant difference on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of DSCT using HPS (100%, 97.1%, 83.3%, 100%), LPS (92.3%, 95.9%, 80%, 98.6%) and SEQ (93.3%, 97.3%, 87.5%, 98.6%) (P > 0.05). The effective dose of DSCT by HPS (1.0 +/- 0.5 mSv) is significant less than that by SEQ (3.0 +/- 1.4 mSv) or LPS (13.0 +/- 5.4 mSv) (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): DSCT using HPS provides good diagnostic accuracy on coronary stent patency compared with CA, similar to that by SEQ/LPS, whereas with lower effective dose in patients with HR lower than 65 bpm. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1085,"Impact of vitamin D correction on circulating irisin: A 12 month interventional study Irisin, a novel myokine secreted by skeletal muscle, promotes browning of white fat and influences glucose and energy homeostasis. Irisin and vitamin D are also known for their roles in the musculoskeletal system. In this study, we examined the impact of vitamin D correction on circulating irisin in Saudi subjects. For this, vitamin D deficient subjects (<=50 nmol/l) were advised to receive adequate sunlight, eat vitamin D enriched foods and retain normal physical activity for correction/improvement in vitamin D status. Seventy-eight (30 male and 48 female) subjects, who responded to vitamin D intervention, were selected for further analyses. Anthropometry and routine biochemical assay were performed. Serum 25 (OH) D was analyzed using electrochemiluminiscence. Irisin levels were analyzed at baseline and after 12-month of intervention. Serum 25 (OH) D levels were significantly increased at post-intervention compared to baseline value (51.0+/-4.0 vs. 27.8+/-2.3 in males and 69.1+/-4.5 vs. 27.1+/-1.8 in females). With an increase in the levels of vitamin D adjusted for age and BMI, a corresponding increase in irisin level was observed in males (P=0.026) and to a lesser extent in females (P=0.093). Thus, vitamin D correction had a significant impact on irisin levels in male Saudi subjects but in females it failed to reach at significance. Further studies are needed in other ethnic population to better understand the influence of vitamin D on irisin regulation and secretion.Copyright © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

744,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
911,"Impact of induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy on pulmonary function and postoperative acute respiratory complications in esophageal cancer Study objective: To evaluate the effects of induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) on pulmonary function and postoperative acute respiratory complications (PARCs). Design(s): A retrospective review of our patients treated with induction cCRT to determine the impact on pulmonary function and identify predictors of PARCs. Correlations were sought between patient demographics, clinical characteristics, pre-cCRT and post-cCRT pulmonary function, radiotherapy dose, chemotherapy agents, and the development of PARCs. Participant(s): One hundred fifty-five patients treated in three separate clinical trials were identified; 47 patients received 30 Gy (150 cGy bid) of radiation concurrently with a single course of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (5FU), and 108 patients received 45 Gy (150 cGy bid in a split course) concurrent with two courses of either cisplatin/5FU (n = 69) or cisplatin/paclitaxel (n = 39). Esophagectomy was performed in 141 of these 155 patients following cCRT. Result(s): cCRT was only associated with significant worsening of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which decreased a median of 21.7% in the 45-Gy group (p = 0.007), and 8.6% in the 30-Gy group (p = 0.07). This DLCO decrease was statistically greater in the 45-Gy group than in the 30-Gy group (p = 0.02). PARCs developed in 18 patients. Percentage of predicted FEV1 and FVC, both before and after cCRT, were both significantly higher in patients without PARCs than in patients with PARCs (p = 0.031 and p = 0.010, respectively). Post-cCRT DLCO was also significantly worse in patients with PARCs (p = 0.002). PARCs occurred significantly more often among those treated with 45 Gy (17 of 102 patients) compared to those treated with 30 Gy (1 of 39 patients) [p = 0.025]. In the 18 patients with PARCs, the median survival was only 2.1 months. This was significantly less than the 16.4-month median survival in the 123 patients who did not have PARCs (p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): In patients treated with induction cCRT, higher radiation doses result in increasing impairment of gas exchange. PARCs were more likely in those patients with lower lung volumes, lower post-cCRT DLCO, and in those receiving higher radiation doses. These acute respiratory complications were also associated with a significant reduction in patient survival.",Excluded
251,"A novel process for introducing a new intraoperative program: a multidisciplinary paradigm for mitigating hazards and improving patient safety BACKGROUND: Since the Institute of Medicine's report, To Err is Human, was published, numerous interventions have been designed and implemented to correct the defects that lead to medical errors and adverse events; however, most efforts were largely reactive. Safety, communication, team performance, and efficiency are areas of care that attract a great deal of attention, especially regarding the introduction of new technologies, techniques, and procedures. We describe a multidisciplinary process that was implemented at our hospital to identify and mitigate hazards before the introduction of a new technique: high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy, (HDR-IORT)., METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiation oncologists, physicists, nurses, hospital risk managers, and equipment specialists used a structured process that included in situ clinical simulation to uncover concerns among care providers and to prospectively identify and mitigate defects for patients who would undergo surgery using the HDR-IORT technique., RESULTS: We identified and corrected 20 defects in the simulated patient care process before application to actual patients. Subsequently, eight patients underwent surgery using the HDR-IORT technique with no recurrence of simulation-identified or unanticipated defects., CONCLUSION: Multiple benefits were derived from the use of this systematic process to introduce the HDR-IORT technique; namely, the safety and efficiency of care for this select patient population was optimized, and this process mitigated harmful or adverse events before the inclusion of actual patients. Further work is needed, but the process outlined in this paper can be universally applied to the introduction of any new technologies, treatments, or procedures.",Excluded
396,"Clinical analysis of concurrent 3DCRT and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in elderly patients Aim: To probe into the clinical effects of concurrent 3DCRT (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy) and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in the elderly patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%. The survival rates within 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.7%, 51.6% and 41.9% respectively, which were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). However, the clinical group had significantly more 1st and 2nd degree myelosuppression and hand-foot syndrome. The symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment. Conclusion(s): Concurrent 3DCRT and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in the elderly patients greatly improved short-term efficacy and survival rate within 1, 2 and 3 years, while the toxic effects also increased greatly, but could be withstood by most patients.",Excluded
337,"Time-related changes in computed tomographic appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency ablation of the rabbit lung: Preliminary experimental study PURPOSE: To evaluate correlations between computed tomographic (CT) appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lungs and to determine whether CT appearance could predict the extent of the effective therapeutic area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lungs of 14 rabbits were subjected to RF ablation and CT scans were obtained immediately and at various intervals thereafter. Four rabbits were killed immediately after the initial CT imaging (n = 4). The remaining 10 rabbits were killed after additional CT scans at intervals of 3 days (n = 2), 1 week (n = 4), 2 weeks (n = 2), and 3 weeks (n = 2) after RF ablation. Pathologic findings were correlated with CT appearance. RESULT(S): Immediately after RF ablation, a restricted area of central dense opacity enclosed by an extensive area of ground-glass opacity was noted in the ablated region on CT images. Pathologically, the former corresponded to destructive tissue and the latter corresponded to tissue with some degree of injury. After 1 week, the entire ablated region appeared as a well-demarcated homogeneous dense opacity on CT that corresponded to necrotic tissue and its surrounding rim of granulation tissue on histopathologic examination, indicating that the enclosing extensive area of ground-glass opacity on the initial CT scan represented an ongoing necrosis. Within 2-3 weeks, the ablated region gradually contracted on the CT images, representing a tissue repairing process in which the granulation tissue was encroaching on the inner necrotic tissue. CONCLUSION(S): Ground-glass opacity of the ablated region on CT immediately after RF ablation represents an ongoing necrosis. © SIR, 2005.",Excluded
425,"[Quantitative analysis of pulmonary functional damage due to heavy ion particle irradiation therapy for lung cancer] Seventeen patients with clinical stage I lung cancer were given irradiation therapy with heavy ion radioactive rays at 73.1 +/- 11.2 GyE. Lung injury due to irradiation was evaluated by measuring routing parameters of pulmonary function. No statistically significant changes in these parameters were observed after irradiation, even in patients followed up for a period of 1 year. Chest X-ray examinations, including CT scan images, disclosed the development of nonsegmental consolidations in the irradiated areas, changing into minor fibrosis 1 year later. We concluded that heavy ion particle irradiation has minimal impact on pulmonary function, and is of therapeutic valve to elderly patients and patients with complications.",Excluded
1165,"Clinical outcome of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and oligometastatic lung tumors: A single institutional study with almost uniform dose with different five treatment schedules Background: To evaluate clinical outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for localized primary and oligometastatic lung tumors by assessing efficacy and safety of 5 regimens of varying fraction size and number. Method(s): One-hundred patients with primary lung cancer (n = 69) or oligometastatic lung tumors (n = 31), who underwent SBRT between May 2003 and August 2010, were included. The median age was 75 years (range, 45-88). Of them, 98 were judged to have medically inoperable disease, predominantly due to chronic illness or advanced age. SBRT was performed using 3 coplanar and 3 non-coplanar fixed beams with a standard linear accelerator. Fraction sizes were escalated by 1 Gy, and number of fractions given was decreased by 1 for every 20 included patients. Total target doses were between 50 and 56 Gy, administered as 5-9 fractions. The prescribed dose was defined at the isocenter, and median overall treatment duration was 10 days (range, 5-22). Result(s): The median follow-up was 51.1 months for survivors. The 3-year local recurrence rates for primary lung cancer and oligometastasis was 6 % and 3 %, respectively. The 3-year local recurrence rates for tumor sizes <=3 cm and >3 cm were 3 % and 14 %, respectively (p = 0.124). Additionally, other factors (fraction size, total target dose, and BED10) were not significant predictors of local control. Radiation pneumonia (>= grade 2) was observed in 2 patients. Radiation-induced rib fractures were observed in 22 patients. Other late adverse events of greater than grade 2 were not observed. Conclusion(s): Within this dataset, we did not observe a dose response in BED10 values between 86.4 and 102.6 Gy. SBRT with doses between 50 and 56 Gy, administered over 5-9 fractions achieved acceptable tumor control without severe complications.Copyright © 2016 Aoki et al.",Excluded
81,"The effect of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma PURPOSE: To assess the effect of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on the treatment of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 38 patients with newly diagnosed (n = 25) and recurrent (n = 13) cutaneous melanoma who were referred for evaluation with FDG PET imaging at our institution. We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded
458,"Assessment of internal exposure doses in Fukushima by a whole body counter within one month after the nuclear power plant accident Information on early internal radiation doses in Fukushima after the nuclear power plant accident on March 11, 2011, is quite limited due to initial organizational difficulties, high background radiation and contamination of radiation measuring devices. In Nagasaki, approximately 1,200 km away from Fukushima, the internal radioactivity in evacuees and short-term visitors to Fukushima has been measured by a whole body counter (WBC) since March 15, 2011. A horizontal bed-type scanning WBC equipped with two NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors was used for 173 people who stayed in the Fukushima prefecture between March 11 and April 10, 2011. The average length of stay was 4.8 days. The internal radioactivity was converted to an estimated amount of intake according to the scenario of acute inhalation, and then the committed effective dose and the thyroid dose were evaluated. 131I, 134Cs and 137Cs were detected in more than 30% of examined individuals. In subjects who stayed in Fukushima from March 12 to March 18, the detection rate was approximately 50% higher for each radionuclide and 44% higher for all three nuclides. The maximum committed effective dose and thyroid equivalent dose were 1 mSv and 20 mSv, respectively. Although the number of subjects and settlements in the study are limited, the results suggest that the internal radiation exposure in Fukushima due to the intake of radioactive materials shortly after the accident will probably not result in any deterministic or stochastic health effects. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
400,"Are the SNPs of NKX2-1 associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma in the Han population of Northern China? Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common tumors of the thyroid gland. The common risk factors of PTC include ionizing radiation, positive family history, and thyroid nodular disease. PTC was identified in Europeans by conducting a genome-wide association study, and a strong association signal with PTC was observed in rs944289 and NKX2-1 (located at the 14q13.3 locus), which was probably the genetic risk factor of PTC. This study aimed to examine the association of this gene with PTC in Chinese. A total of 354 patients with PTC and 360 healthy control subjects from the Han population of Northern China were recruited in the study. These individuals were genotyped to determine rs12589672, rs12894724, rs2076751, and rs944289. The association of rs944289 with PTC was obtained (C vs. T, P = 0.027, OR = 1.264, 95% CI = 1.026 - 1.557; and C/C - C/T vs. T/T, P = 0.034, OR = 1.474, 95% CI = 1.028 - 2.112). Conducting a subgroup analysis, we found a marginal difference in the allele frequency distribution of rs944289 (adjusted P = 0.062) between the patients with PTC and multi-nodular goiter and the control subjects. We also observed an interaction (P = 0.029; OR = 2.578, 95% CI = 1.104 - 6.023) between rs944289 and diabetes in patients with PTC. In conclusion, rs944289 was associated with an increased risk of PTC in the Han population of Northern China, but no clear association was observed in either of the tag single nucleotide polymorphisms of NKX2-1.",Excluded
843,"Preoperative downstaging chemoradiation with concurrent irinotecan and capecitabine in MRI-defined locally advanced rectal cancer: A phase i trial (NWCOG-2) Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation using radiotherapy (RT) combined with concurrent capecitabine and irinotecan for locally advanced rectal cancer before surgery. Method(s):Forty-six patients were recruited and treated on the basis that MRI scanning had shown poor-risk tumours with threatening (1 mm) or involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Conformal RT was given using 3 or 4 fields at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 days per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. Concurrently oral capecitabine was given twice daily throughout radiotherapy continuously from days 1 to 35 and intravenous irinotecan was given once per week during weeks 1 to 4 of RT. Dose levels were gradually escalated as follows. Dose level 1: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 50 mg m 2; Dose level 2: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 3: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 4: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 70 mg m 2. Result(s):Diarrhoea (grade 3, no grade 4) was the main serious acute toxicity with lesser degrees of fatigue, neutropenia, anorexia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The recommended dose for future study was dose level 2 at which 3 of 14 patients (21%) developed grade 3 diarrhoea. Postoperative complications included seven pelvic or wound infections and two anastomotic and two perineal wound dehiscences. There were no deaths in the first 30 days postoperatively. Of 41 resected specimens, 11 (27%) showed a pathological complete response (pCR) and five (12%) showed an involved circumferential resection margin (defined as 1 mm). The 3-year disease-free survival (intent-to-treat) was 53.2%. Conclusion(s):In patients with poor-risk MRI-defined locally advanced rectal cancer threatening or involving the mesorectal fascia, preoperative chemoradiation based on RT at 45 Gy in 25 daily fractions over 5 weeks with continuous daily oral capecitabine at 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. days 1-35 and weekly IV irinotecan at 60 mg m 2 weeks 1-4, provides acceptable acute toxicity and postoperative morbidity with encouraging response and curative resection rates. © 2009 Cancer Research UK.",Excluded

219,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.

343,"Straylight effects with aging and lens extraction PURPOSE: To assess possible gains and losses in straylight values among the population to consider straylight as added benefit of lens extraction., DESIGN: In this cross-sectional design, data from a multicenter study on visual function in automobile drivers were analyzed., METHODS: On both eyes of 2,422 subjects, visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] in steps of 0.02 log units), straylight on the retina (psychophysical compensation comparison method), and lens opacity (slit-lamp scoring using the Lens Opacities Classification System III [LOCS III] system) were determined. Three groups were defined: 220 pseudophakic eyes, 3,182 noncataractous eyes (average LOCS III score, <1.5), and 134 cataractous eyes (average LOCS III score, >3.0)., RESULTS: Noncataractous straylight values increases strongly with age as: log(s) = constant + log(1 + (age / 65)(4)), doubling by the age of 65 years, and tripling by the age of 77 years. Population standard deviation around this age norm was approximately 0.10 log units. The cataract eyes (in this active driver group) had relatively mild straylight increase. In pseudophakia, straylight values may be very good, better even than in the noncataract group. Visual acuity and straylight were found to vary quite independently., CONCLUSIONS: Lens extraction holds promise not only to improve on the condition of the cataract eye, but also to improve on the age-normal eye. Lens extraction potentially reverses the strong age increase in straylight value, quite independently from visual acuity.",Excluded

Biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS) were selected as study endpoints. Survival was examined using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression modelling. Urinary, quality of life (QoL), and potency scores at baseline and last follow-up were recorded., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12.5 years (range, 10.1-21.8 years). At the time of analysis, 88.6% of patients were alive, 1.5% died from prostate cancer and 13.9% developed biochemical failure, with 82% of failures occurring in the first decade of follow-up. Overall, 2.3% developed distant metastases. On multivariate analyses, stage T3a-T3b, prostate-specific antigen level of >20 ng/mL, intermediate- and high-risk disease predicted worse BFFS; whereas age >70 years at diagnosis and stage T3a-T3b predicted worse OS. A total biologically effective dose of >=150 Gy and androgen-deprivation therapy were associated with improved BFFS, but not OS. The overall 17-year rates for BFFS, DMFS, PCSS, and OS were 79, 97, 97, and 72%, respectively. Respective 17-year BFFS rates for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients were 86, 80, and 65% (P < 0.001), whereas OS rates for the same groups were 82, 73, and 60%, respectively (P = 0.09). Amongst those patients who were potent at baseline, 25% remained potent at the last follow-up. Urinary function and QoL were mainly unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: LDR-BT yields excellent survival rates, with a 17-year PCSS rate of 97%. In all, 18% of patients with biochemical relapse failed at >10 years after implantation, which justifies their continued follow-up.

At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT. The majority of the symptom cluster severity scores were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with prostate cancer.""",Included
1264,"Radiation exposure due to local fallout from Soviet atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan: solid cancer mortality in the Semipalatinsk historical cohort, 1960-1999 Little information is available on the health effects of exposures to fallout from Soviet nuclear weapons testing and on the combined external and internal environmental exposures that have resulted from these tests. This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out.

303,"Multidisciplinary team approach for Merkel cell carcinoma: the European Institute of Oncology experience with focus on radiotherapy Objective: To review the therapeutic strategy in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) treated with radiotherapy (RT) discussed in a multidisciplinary tumour board. Method(s): Clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of MCC and with an indication to undergo RT at the European Institute of Oncology between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field. At the time of data collection, 16 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 patient was alive with advanced status of disease, 8 patients died of disease progression, and 1 patient died of other causes. Conclusion(s): The management of unknown primary and polyomavirus-positive cases, which had a better prognosis in our series, may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, given the limited data available regarding optimal treatment.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.",Excluded
275,"Primary orbital meningioma: a study of six cases at a single institution Primary orbital meningioma is a rare tumor of the anterior visual pathway and constitutes approximately 2% of all orbital tumors and 1-2% of all meningiomas. The differentiation from secondary orbital meningioma of intracranial origin is sometimes difficult on image. As the tumor often leads to visual loss if left untreated and surgical intervention inevitably causes morbidity, the timing and modality of treatment are very important. We carried out the study involving six cases (mean age: 42.7 years, male to female ratio: 1:5) of primary orbital meningioma to further elucidate its behavior. The clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and follow-up information are recorded for all cases. The most frequent initial symptoms were visual complaints (100%) and proptosis (67%). In five cases, the diagnosis was based on pathologic findings and the tumors were all grade I meningiomas. In one case, however, the diagnosis was based on radiographic and clinical findings, lacking histologic confirmation. Five patients were operated on, four underwent tumor removal, and one received eyeball exenteration. One patient was treated with Novalis radiotherapy. The mean follow-up period was 8.8 years (range from 9 months to 15 years). All patients experienced loss of vision during the course without exception. No recurrent tumor was found in five cases during follow-up. In case 5, whose eyeball was exenterated, developed recurrent meningioma 7 years later. She received radiotherapy but the tumor was out of control. She expired 8 years after eyeball exenteration. The primary orbital meningioma is aggressive in behavior despite its benign histopathologic features. Loss of vision is frequently seen even after treatment. The tumor could be fatal if surgery and radiotherapy fail to control its intracranial extension.",Excluded
391,"The Association of Socioeconomic Status with the Burden of Cataract-related Blindness and the Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: An Ecological Study Objective: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of socioeconomic status on this health burden. Method(s): National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Result(s): Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for interaction = 0.047). Conclusion(s): Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in developing countries with high-UVR exposure.Copyright © 2021 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

1145,"Early Stage Extranodal Follicular Lymphoma: Characteristics, Management, and Outcomes Introduction: Extranodal follicular lymphoma (E-FL) is a rare entity that has distinct characteristics and outcomes compared with nodal follicular lymphoma. Patients and Methods: This cohort comprised 37 patients with stages I/II E-FL, diagnosed from 2003 to 2013. Outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Result(s): Median age was 60 years (range, 37-84 years). Disease was stage I in 29 (78.4%). The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score was 0 to 1 in 31 (83.8%), 2 in 2 (5.4%), 3 in 1 (2.7%), and missing in 3 (8.1%). Sites of involvement included the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 22 (59.5%), and non-GI sites in 15 (40.5%). Initial management consisted of chemotherapy (CHT) alone in 21 (56.8%), radiation therapy (RT) alone in 2 patients (5.4%), RT and rituximab in 1 (2.7%), CHT and RT in 7 (18.9%), and observation in 6 (16.2%). RT was to a median dose of 30.6 Gy (range, 23.4-44.0 Gy). At a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 8-157 months), 5-year PFS and OS were 70.4% and 94.4%, respectively. Although the 5-year PFS of those observed was worse than for those who received therapy (33.3% vs. 77.6%; P = .011), that did not translate into an OS difference. Patients who received RT as part of upfront management had a 100% local control (LC) rate and a trend toward improved 5-year PFS (90% vs. 62.2%; P = .067). Conclusion(s): Early stage E-FL is an indolent disease and is associated with excellent OS. Treatment strategies should be individualized with RT prioritized when LC is a significant goal., This was a retrospective study to investigate management and outcomes of early stage extranodal follicular lymphoma patients because there is limited literature on this subgroup of patients. Although this is an indolent disease, we found a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival rates with treatment compared with observation alone. Patients who received radiation therapy as part of upfront treatment had excellent local control. The results of this study show that treatment should be individualized, and radiation can be a great option in patients for whom local control is essential.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
473,"Image quality and required radiation dose for coronary computed tomography angiography using an automatic tube potential selection technique To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 25.6 +/- 7.6 versus 15.8 +/- 4.0 HU, P < 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 +/- 142.0 versus 412.5 +/- 64.3 HU, P < 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 +/- 7.40 versus 27.71 +/- 8.25, P < 0.001; CNR: 27.81 +/- 8.44 versus 33.94 +/- 9.69, P < 0.001). ED was significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (ED: 1.25 +/- 1.24 versus 2.19 +/- 1.77 mSv, P < 0.001). For both groups, ED was significantly lower in the high-pitch mode than in the sequential mode. The use of ATPS for CCTA significantly reduced the radiation dose while maintaining image quality.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Excluded

657,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included
898,"Laboratory selection for an accelerated mosquito sexual development rate BACKGROUND: Separating males and females at the early adult stage did not ensure the virginity of females of Anopheles arabiensis (Dongola laboratory strain), whereas two years earlier this method had been successful. In most mosquito species, newly emerged males and females are not able to mate successfully. For anopheline species, a period of 24 h post-emergence is generally required for the completion of sexual maturation, which in males includes a 180° rotation of the genitalia. In this study, the possibility of an unusually shortened sexual maturity period in the laboratory-reared colony was investigated.
METHODS: The effect of two different sex-separation methods on the virginity of females was tested: females separated as pupae or less than 16 h post-emergence were mated with males subjected to various doses of radiation. T-tests were performed to compare the two sex-separation methods. The rate of genitalia rotation was compared for laboratory-reared and wild males collected as pupae in Dongola, Sudan, and analysed by Z-tests. Spermatheca dissections were performed on females mated with laboratory-reared males to determine their insemination status.
RESULTS: When the sex-separation was performed when adults were less than 16 h post-emergence, expected sterility was never reached for females mated with radio-sterilized males. Expected sterility was accomplished only when sexes were separated at the pupal stage. Observation of genitalia rotation showed that some males from the laboratory strain Dongola were able to successfully mate only 11 h after emergence and 42% of the males had already completed rotation. A small proportion of the same age females were inseminated. Wild males showed a much slower genitalia rotation rate. At 17 h post-emergence, 96% of the laboratory-reared males had completed genitalia rotation whereas none of the wild males had.
CONCLUSION: This colony has been cultured in the laboratory for over one hundred generations, and now has accelerated sexual maturation when compared with the wild strain. This outcome demonstrates the kinds of selection that can be expected during insect colonization and maintenance, particularly when generations are non-overlapping and similar-age males must compete for mates.",Excluded
290,"Assessing the Effect of Weight-Based Protocol Modifications to Lower Dose for CT-Guided Hepatic and Renal Tumor Radiofrequency Ablations OBJECTIVE: This study assessed radiation dose after CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablations (RFAs) of hepatic and renal tumors and the effect of weight-based CT protocol modification for lowering overall dose in these procedures., MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT-guided RFA for renal and hepatic ablations performed from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, were retrospectively reviewed (90 men and 48 women; age, 42-81 years). The radiation dose was recorded during each of the following steps: planning, performing, and postprocedure. Weight-based protocol modification changes in tube voltage and tube current were then applied to renal and hepatic ablations performed subsequently (18 men and 11 women; age, 48-82 years). Image quality, needle localization, lesion detection, ability to detect complications, and overall operator satisfaction were noted for each case (score, 1-5). Dose reduction after modification was then calculated., RESULTS: Retrospective analysis found a mean (+/- SD) overall CT dose index (CTDI) for CT-guided RFA to be 16.5 +/- 2.3 mGy. After protocol modification, the mean CTDI decreased to 6.63 +/- 0.67 mGy, a 59.6% reduction overall; for hepatic ablations, the reduction was 65.96% (p < 0.0001) and the reduction for renal ablations was 38.97% (p = 0.0153). Image quality analysis showed high operator satisfaction (3-5), including adequate needle localization (4-5), lesion visibility (3-5), and high performer confidence (4-5). Higher dose reduction was noted for patients weighing more than 180 lb (82 kg) (p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Simple weight-based CT protocol modifications can significantly reduce radiation dose during CT-guided percutaneous ablations in the liver and kidneys without significantly sacrificing image quality.",Excluded
819,"Role of aortic calcification, stiffness and wave reflections in cardiovascular risk in dialysis patients: Baseline data from the CORD study Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Method(s): Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Result(s): Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.",Excluded
24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm.

Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded
163,"Evaluation of radiation-induced changes to parotid glands following conventional radiotherapy in patients with nasopharygneal carcinoma Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included
360,"Factors associated with presence and extent of coronary calcium in those predicted to be at low risk according to Framingham risk score (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Even among asymptomatic persons at low risk (<10%) according to the Framingham risk score, high coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores signify a greater predicted risk of coronary heart disease events. We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

Mean visual acuity prior to proton beam irradiation was 0.7 logMAR (0.2 DIN (DIN 58220 norm)) (range 2-0.3 logMAR) and declined to 0.8 logMAR (0.16 DIN; range 2-0.1 logMAR) at last follow-up examination (no statistical significance, P =.071). Conclusion The anatomic outcome after proton beam therapy for retinal papillary hemangioma is convincing, whereas functional outcome may be compromised because of tumor location, long-persisting macular edema, extensive exudation, and poor initial visual acuity. In patients with extended retinal detachment surgical intervention was still necessary. Although proton beam therapy is proven to be a therapeutic option, treatment will remain challenging. © 2014 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
397,"Multilevel analysis of solar radiation and cancer mortality using ecological data in Japan A preventive effect of solar radiation on cancer has been suspected. This study aimed to compare the statistical relationship between solar radiation and cancer mortality according to hierarchical models and adjustment for confounding factors, and then to demonstrate the relationship with main site-specific cancer mortalities in Japan. We examined the relationship between all-site and main site-specific cancer mortalities and global solar radiation using Poisson regression with municipal data around 2000. The models included single-level (municipality) and multilevel (municipality and prefecture) with/without potential confounding factors (lifestyle and socioeconomic variables). For all-site cancer, single-level analysis showed a significant, strong negative association with solar radiation. However, multilevel analysis showed a moderate or no association. In multilevel analysis with potential confounding factors, solar radiation was significantly negatively associated with most site-specific cancers, but not with gallbladder and liver cancer in men and stomach and breast cancer in women. Our findings support the preventive effective of solar radiation on several types of cancer. However, to show a concrete relationship, a statistical model with an appropriate hierarchy and adjustment for potential confounding factors is required.",Excluded
104,"CT for evaluation of urolithiasis: image quality of ultralow-dose (Sub mSv) CT with knowledge-based iterative reconstruction and diagnostic performance of low-dose CT with statistical iterative reconstruction Purpose: To compare radiation dose and image quality in regular, low, and ultralow-dose CT protocols, and to evaluate diagnostic performance of low-dose CT for urolithiasis. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-five patients with suspected urolithiasis underwent three different scans under the regular, low, and ultralow-dose protocols. The regular dose scans were reconstructed using filtered back projection and the low-dose scans were reconstructed using a statistical iterative reconstruction. The ultralow-dose scans were reconstructed using both techniques in addition to a knowledge-based IR. Effective radiation doses were compared. Objective image noise was assessed by measuring standard deviation of HU and subjective image assessment was performed with a 3- or 5-point scale. Diagnostic performance of the low-dose image was evaluated, using the regular dose image as a standard reference and the interobserver agreement between two reviewers with different levels of experience was calculated. Result(s): The effective radiation dose was significantly different in each protocol (p < 0.001) and estimated dose reduction of the low-dose and ultralow-dose protocols was 76.4% and 89.8%, respectively. The knowledge-based iterative reconstruction algorithm showed poorer subjective image quality than the regular and low-dose protocols, but it also had the least objective image noise. Overall, the low-dose image set showed a greater than 84% concordance rate and 100% in ureter stones larger than 3 mm. Interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa value = 0.61). Conclusion(s): The knowledge-based IR can provide a better quality image while reducing radiation exposure under the same protocol. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the low-dose CT protocol is comparable to the regular dose scan.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
602,"Low concentration contrast medium for dual-source computed tomography coronary angiography by a combination of iterative reconstruction and low-tube-voltage technique: Feasibility study Objectives To assess the impact of low-concentration contrast medium on vascular enhancement, image quality and radiation dose of coronary CT angiography (cCTA) by using a combination of iterative reconstruction (IR) and low-tube-voltage technique. Materials and methods One hundred patients were prospectively randomized to two types of contrast medium and underwent prospective electrocardiogram-triggering cCTA (Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare; collimation: 128 mm x 0.6 mm; tube current: 300 mA s). Fifty patients received Iopromide 370 were scanned using the conventional tube setting (100 kVp or 120 kVp if BMI >= 25 kg/m2) and reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP). Fifty patients received Iodixanol 270 were scanned using the low-tube-voltage (80 kVp or 100 kVp if BMI >= 25 kg/m 2) technique and reconstructed with IR. CT attenuation was measured in coronary artery and other anatomical regions. Noise, image quality and radiation dose were compared. Results Compared with two Iopromide 370 subgroups, Iomeprol 270 subgroups showed no significant difference in CT attenuation (576.63 +/- 95.50 vs. 569.51 +/- 118.93 for BMI < 25 kg/m 2, p = 0.647 and 394.19 +/- 68.09 vs. 383.72 +/- 63.11 for BMI >= 25 kg/m2, p = 0.212), noise (in various anatomical regions of interest) and image quality (3.5 vs. 4.0, p = 0.13), but significantly (0.41 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.45 for BMI < 25 kg/m2, p < 0.001 and 1.14 +/- 0.24 vs. 2.37 +/- 0.69 for BMI >= 25 kg/m 2, p < 0.001) lower radiation dose, which reflects dose saving of 56.4% and 51.9%, respectively. Conclusions Combined IR with low-tube-voltage technique, a low-concentration contrast medium of 270 mg I/ml can still maintain the contrast enhancement without impairing image quality, as well as significantly lower the radiation dose. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
851,"The effect of chronic low-level exposure on hair damages of radiation workers According to chronic exposure of radiation workers during their work experience,this study was an attempt to assess the damage caused by radiation on the hair of radiation workers. In this study the total Skin and Hair Analyzing System capable of registering polarized images was used for measuring hair parameters (hair thickness,hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil). Hair management software ,Skin Management Software and also 150X,700X lenses were used to measure the hair parameters. The study included one questionnaire which it's face validity and content validity was approved by pilot study and some professional experts. The participants were 152 hospital personnel and were divided into radiation exposed group (radiotherapy technicians,nuclear medicine technicians) and control group (nurses) and were homogenized based on age,work situation,work time,work experience and baldness (family history). Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers. The reason may be inadequate training of technologists and their high workload.Copyright © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.",Included
455,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included
526,"Schistosoma mansoni phosphofructokinase : Immunolocalization in the tegument and immunogenicity Schistosoma mansoni depends for its survival on glycolysis. Two glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase and triose-phosphate dehydrogenase, found in both the adult and schistosomular tegument, hare been reported to confer partial protection against cercarial infection. This paper describes the immunogenic properties of phosphofructokinase (PFK), a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and its localization in the tegument and adjacent tissues. Recombinant schistosome PFK was used as antigen. A polyclonal antibody against purified PFK from Fasciola hepatica was affinity purified using recombinant PFR and used in combination with immunogold labelling to identify PFK by transmission electron microscopy in cryosections. In both adult worms and in schistosomula most immunogold label localized in the cytoplasmic syncytial region with less being found in the tegument. There was no significant PFK localization within or external to the outer membrane. Sera from mice immunized with recombinant S. mansoni PFK with Freund's adjuvant or alum plus rIL-12 demonstrated high titres of anti-PFK IgC, but no protection against cercarial infection. Sera from mice that were acutely or chronically infected or multiply exposed to irradiated cercariae did not recognize recombinant schistosome PFK in either Western blotting or ELISA. Similarly, sera from humans infected with S. mansoni did not recognize PFK. We conclude that in spite of the high immunogenicity of rPFK in mice, it is not a significant immunogen during the course of infection and does not confer protection from schistosomiasis. One main difference between PFK and the other 2 glycolytic enzymes seems to be the inaccessibility of PFK to the outside surface of the tegument.",Excluded

RP events were retrospectively scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify clinical variables and genotypes associated with risk of RP of grades >=2 and >=3 on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis esting., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 21.4 months, the incidence of grade >=2 RP was 29% and grade >=3 RP was 14%. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical factors such as concurrent chemotherapy and consolidation docetaxel, and lung dosimetric parameters such as volume receiving greater than 20 Gy and mean lung dose, MTHFR genotype (rs1801131; AA versus AC/CC) was significantly associated with risk of grade >=2 RP (hazard ratio: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.76; P = .006, corrected P = .018) and grade >=3 RP (hazard ratio: 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.70; P = .01; corrected P = .03). SOD2 genotype was not associated with RP., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an association between MTHFR genotype and risk of clinically significant RP.

769,"Polyethyleneimine grafted with pluronic P85 enhances Ku86 antisense delivery and the ionizing radiation treatment efficacy in vivo In an effort to improve the efficacy of antisense delivery, we evaluated polyethyleneimine (PEI, 2 kDa) alone or grafted with nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer Pluronic (P85) as a carrier for Ku86 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) delivery. Ku86 is an abundant nuclear protein that plays an important role in nonhomologous DNA end joining and has implications in tumorigenesis and acquired drug resistance. Transfection of adherent and suspension cell lines with Ku86 ASOs complexed with P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) conjugates was associated with a specific decrease in Ku86 mRNA levels (EC50<75 nM and EC50<250 nM, respectively, n=3). More importantly, no requirement for reduced serum conditions was necessary during transfection. In contrast, whereas Ku86 ASOs complexed with PEI (2 kDa) alone were effective in decreasing Ku86 mRNA levels in adherent cell lines (EC50<75 nM, n=3), the formulation did not produce any detectable decrease in Ku86 mRNA levels in suspension cell lines. Transfection of adherent cell lines with 500 nM Ku86 ASOs formulated with P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) was associated with a specific decrease (<10% remaining of control) in Ku86 protein expression and a two-fold increased cell death after treatment with ionizing radiation (IR). In athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous human HT29 colon adenocarcinoma xenografts, Ku86 ASO-P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) administration (15 mg/kg, subcutaneously) with a Q1D x 7 treatment schedule, when combined with a single dose of IR (6 Gy), caused a significant inhibition of HT29 tumor growth compared with mismatch- and naked antisense-pretreated control groups (time from 200 to 1000 mm3, 126.9 versus 84.18 and 87.76 days, P<0.005). A potentiation of the antitumor activity was observed in all mice treated with Ku86 ASO-P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) formulation; however, tumor growth inhibition was reversible upon treatment cessation. No morbidity/mortality or changes in histopathology were observed under this treatment regiment. Our results indicate that P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) conjugates may increase the efficacy of Ku86 ASO delivery in management of resistant malignancies, thus providing a rationale for their evaluation in cancer patients in combination with conventional anticancer therapies.",Excluded
863,"Skin cancer in heart transplant recipients: frequency and risk factor analysis BACKGROUND: The frequency of skin cancer is increased among organ transplant recipients, but the predisposing risk factors are controversial. It is also unclear whether heart transplant patients face an increased risk compared to recipients of other organs, e.g. kidney transplants., METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for skin cancer in 252 heart transplants and in a control series of 228 kidney transplants followed up at a single center. An extensive dermatologic examination was carried out; baseline features, type of immunosuppression, number of 3A rejection episodes, extent of sunlight exposure and skin type were recorded. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) included: age at transplantation, sex, skin type (Fitzpatrick's criteria), presence of solar keratosis, presence of warts, type of organ, sunlight exposure., RESULTS: During follow up skin cancer was more common among heart transplants (40, 16 %) than in kidney transplants (16, 7%, p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of skin cancer by life table analysis increased from 16% after 5 years to 33% after 10 years in heart transplant patients and from 6% to 17% in kidney transplants (p 10000 hours (relative risk = 2.8), but not organ type were significant risk factors., CONCLUSION: Age at transplant, skin type and sunlight exposure, but not type of organ and type of immunosuppressive regimen, are associated with increased risk of skin cancer in heart transplantation.",Excluded
1028,"Targeting the achilles' shield of triple-negative breast cancers by androgen blockade Purpose/Objective(s): Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) account for 15-20% of breast carcinomas and are defined by their lack of ER/PR expression, along with the absence of HER2 overexpression or gene amplification. The lack of recognized targets coupled with its aggressive biology makes this subset of breast cancer a subject of intensive effort for new molecular target identification. Several phase III clinical trials have shown a clear benefit in overall survival with androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease. In preclinical data, a subset of AR positive, TNBC are dependent on androgen receptor signaling for growth although the degree of dependency is substantially less than that observed in prostate cancer. The differential dependence on androgen signaling in prostate cancers versus breast cancers that express AR remain poorly understood. Materials/Methods: We previously developed a platform that makes possible the profiling of cancer cell line survival to DNA-damaging insults in high-throughput capacity. We used this technology to study the radiosensitivity of 28 breast cancer cell lines annotated by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to correlate radiosensitivity with gene expression features of the assayed cell lines. We validated our results using cellular based assays and orthotopic mouse xenografts. Result(s): We demonstrate that: 1) androgens and a subset of androgen precursors protect breast cancer cells from ionizing radiation by minimizing DNA damage and enhancing repair; 2) androgen blockade significantly sensitizes breast cancer cells that express AR to DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo, despite a modest effect on growth in both cell lines and in orthotopic cell line xenograft models; and 3) the response of TNBC cell lines to androgen blockade is heterogeneous, with resistance to antiandrogen therapy being mediated in part by intratumoral steroid biosynthesis including the conversion of the weak adrenal androgens like androstenedione into the AR ligands testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Conclusion(s): Our results establish multiple lines of evidence that androgen signaling confers therapeutic resistance and is a targetable event that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in TNBC.",Excluded

Method(s): Individuals of both gender between 40 to 65 years of age without pre-existing coronary artery disease from residents of Karachi were recruited through snowball sampling technique. Study was conducted at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan during January to June 2019. Ethnicity of the participants was categorized based on their mother tongue. Ten-year risk of ASCVD event was estimated using Astro-CHARM Calculator and PCE. Result(s): Mean age of a total of 386 individuals was 49(+/-7.1) years and 45.3% (175) were females. Urdu-speaking individuals were 33.4%(129) of the sample, while,of18.4%(71) Pushtoons,pri14%(54) Sindhi, 13%(50) Punjabi, 2.6%(10) Balochi, and remaining 18.7%(72) were of other ethnicities. High risk (>=7.5%) individuals were 20.7% (80/386) as per PCE and 11.1% (43/386) as per Astro-CHARM.

134,"Does prior microsurgery improve or worsen the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus meningiomas? Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an important option for patients with cavernous sinus meningiomas. Objective(s): To evaluate cranial nerve outcomes in patients who underwent SRS for cavernous sinus meningiomas with or without prior microsurgery. Method(s): During a 23-year interval, 272 patients underwent Gamma Knife SRS for cavernous sinus meningiomas (70 men, 202 women; median age, 54 years). In this series, 99 patients underwent prior microsurgical resection. The median tumor volume was 7.9 cm and median marginal dose was 13 Gy. The median follow-up period was 62 months (range, 6-209 months). Result(s): The progression-free survival after SRS was 96% at 3 years, 94% at 5 years, and 86% at 10 years. After SRS, 13 of 91 patients (14%) who underwent prior microsurgery had improvement of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms or signs. In comparison, 54 of 145 patients (37%) without prior microsurgery had improvement of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms or signs. The improvement rate of cranial nerve deficits after SRS in patients without prior microsurgery was 20% at 1 year, 34% at 2 years, 36% at 3 years, and 39% at 5 years. Patients who had not undergone prior microsurgery had significantly higher improvement rates of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms and signs (P = .001). After SRS, 29 patients (11%) developed new or worsened cranial nerve function. Conclusion(s): SRS provided long-term effective tumor control and a low risk of new cranial nerve deficits. Improvement in preexisting cranial neuropathies was detected in significantly more patients who had not undergone prior microsurgical procedures. © 2013 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
184,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200. Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Included

A prospective study was carried out to compare these three techniques of radiation treatment planning to quantitatively find out the difference in normal tissue dosages and target volume coverage in the three groups after three-dimensional evaluation., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CT scans of 30 patients in the treatment position, taken on a Shimadzu SCT-3000 TF scanner at 1cm intervals, were transferred to Theraplan-500 three-dimensional radiation treatment planning computer. The normal tissues and target volumes (GTV and CTV) were outlined on all the CT slices as per (ICRU) Report no. 50. Three types of radiation treatment planning was done sequentially: Plan I-based on the surface markings alone, Plan II-based on simulator-fluoroscopy, and Plan III-based on Simulator-CT., RESULTS: The mean dose to 95% of the clinical target volume (D95) was increased by 4.4 and 6.4% by Plans II and III as compared with Plan I. The mean dose to 3/3rd (D(3/3)) to all the critical organs was decreased by 6.6 and 8.4% by Plans II and III as compared to Plan I. The mean time, in simulator room, for field placement for Plans I-III was 6.2, 14.6 and 44 min, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Thus for adequate coverage of target volumes and sparing normal tissues, Simulator-CT based radiation treatment planning is the best method of radiation treatment planning though it is more time consuming.",Excluded
1213,"Chronic bronchitis in the cohort of Mayak workers first employed 1948-1958 Incidence of chronic bronchitis has been studied in a cohort of 12,210 workers first employed at one of the main plants of the Mayak nuclear facility during 1948-1958 and followed up to 31 December 2005. Information on external gamma doses is available for virtually all of these workers; in contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30% of workers. During the follow-up period in the study cohort 1,175 incident cases of chronic bronchitis were verified. The analyses of nonradiation factors revealed that the underlying risk of chronic bronchitis incidence increased with increasing attained age and was higher among smokers compared with never-smokers as would be expected. The most interesting finding in relationship to nonradiation factors was a sharp increase in the baseline chronic bronchitis risk before 1960. The cause of this is not clear but a number of factors may play a role. Based on the follow-up data after 1960, the analysis showed a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with cumulative external gamma-ray dose (ERR/Gy = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01, 0.32). Based on the same subset but with an additional restriction to members with cumulative internal lung dose below 1 Gy, a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with internal alpha-radiation lung dose from incorporated plutonium was found (ERR/Gy = 2.70, 95% CI 1.20, 4.87). In both cases, adjustment was made for nonradiation factors, including smoking and either internal or external dose as appropriate. At present there are no similar incidence studies with which to compare results. However, the most recent data from the atomic bomb survivor cohort (the Life Span Study) showed statistically significant excess mortality risk for respiratory diseases of 22% per Gy and this value is within the confidence bounds of the point estimate of the risk from this study in relation to external dose.",Excluded
615,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice. Routine radiographs most specifically document mature ossifications.",Excluded
846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded

We studied subjective pain by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) for all patients and functional capacity in patients with chronic shoulder pain. Furthermore we studied the calcification of the rotator cuff before therapy and 6 weeks after therapy. Pain significantly improved over all patients (p < 0.0001) as well as the functional capability. X-rays 6 weeks after treatment showed a partial disintegration of calcification in about 80 % of patients. Because of the low number of patients with epicondylitis humeri we found no significant improvement of pain in these patients. A single ESWT therapy can significantly improve pain and functional capability in patients with radiographic evidence of calcifying tendonitis of the rotator cuff and heel spur. In about 80 % of our patients X-rays showed a partial disintegration of calcification within 6 weeks.",Excluded
202,"Dose reduction in standard head CT: First results from a new scanner using iterative reconstruction and a new detector type in comparison with two previous generations of multi-slice CT Purpose: Computed tomography (CT) accounts for more than half of the total radiation exposure from medical procedures, which makes dose reduction in CT an effective means of reducing radiation exposure. We analysed the dose reduction that can be achieved with a new CT scanner [Somatom Edge (E)] that incorporates new developments in hardware (detector) and software (iterative reconstruction). Method(s): We compared weighted volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) values of 25 consecutive patients studied with non-enhanced standard brain CT with the new scanner and with two previous models each, a 64-slice 64-row multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanner with 64 rows (S64) and a 16-slice 16-row MDCT scanner with 16 rows (S16). We analysed signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios in images from the three scanners and performed a quality rating by three neuroradiologists to analyse whether dose reduction techniques still yield sufficient diagnostic quality. Result(s): CTDI Vol of scanner E was 41.5 and 36.4 % less than the values of scanners S16 and S64, respectively; the DLP values were 40 and 38.3 % less. All differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were best in S64; these differences also reached statistical significance. Image analysis, however, showed non- inferiority"" of scanner E regarding image quality. Conclusion(s): The first experience with the new scanner shows that new dose reduction techniques allow for up to 40 % dose reduction while still maintaining image quality at a diagnostically usable level. © 2013 The Author(s).""",Excluded
401,"Factors hindering social participation among older residents from evacuation zones after the nuclear power plant accident in Fukushima: The Fukushima health management survey Considering the health effects of radiation accompanying the nuclear power plant accident that occurred in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake, this study aimed to examine social participation after the disaster and factors hindering participation among citizens aged >= 65 years from designated evacuation zones inside the Fukushima prefecture. The target population comprised 180,604 residents in 13 municipalities containing designated evacuation zones. There were 73,433 valid responses (response rate, 40.7%); of which, data from 19,573 respondents aged >= 65 years were analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the factors associated with social participation. In total, 53.0% of older evacuees did not participate in recreational activities or communal services. Stratified analysis showed that living outside the Fu-kushima prefecture and requiring assistance with activities of daily living were associated with low social participation. This study clarified that the majority of older evacuees did not participate in social activities at the time of the survey within one year of the disaster. Furthermore, where these older individuals were evacuated to and whether they were able to live independently might have affected their social participation. Better subjective health, better sleep quality, and more frequent exercise may be associated with improved social participation.Copyright © 2021 by the author.

800,"Early hyperbaric oxygen therapy for reducing radiotherapy side effects: early results of a randomized trial in oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer PURPOSE: Comparison of quality of life (QoL) and side effects in a randomized trial for early hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) after radiotherapy (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2006, 19 patients with tumor originating from the tonsillar fossa and/or soft palate (15), base of tongue (1), and nasopharynx (3) were randomized to receive HBOT or not. HBOT consisted of 30 sessions at 2.5 ATA (15 msw) with oxygen breathing for 90 min daily, 5 days per week, applied shortly after the RT treatment was completed. As of 2005, all patients received validated questionnaires (i.e., the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ Head and Neck Cancer Module (H&N35), Performance Status Scale): before treatment; at the start of RT treatment; after 46 Gy; at the end of RT treatment; and 2, 4, and 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after follow-up., RESULTS: On all QoL items, better scores were obtained in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen.

77,"The diagnostic accuracy, image quality and radiation dose of 64-slice dual-source CT in daily practice: a single institution's experience OBJECTIVE: We wanted to evaluate the image quality, diagnostic accuracy and radiation exposure of 64-slice dual-source CT (DSCT) coronary angiography according to the heart rate in symptomatic patients during daily clinical practice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective search for the DSCT coronary angiography reports of 729 consecutive symptomatic patients. For the 131 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography, the image quality, the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value [NPV] for detecting significant stenosis >= 50% diameter) and the radiation exposure were evaluated. These values were compared between the groups with differing heart rates (HR): mean HR < 65 or >= 65 and HR variability (HRV) < 15 or >= 15., RESULTS: Among the 729 patients, the CT reports showed no stenosis or insignificant coronary artery stenosis in 72%, significant stenosis in 26% and non-diagnostic in 2%. For the 131 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography, 95% of the patients and 97% of the segments were evaluable, and the overall per-patient/per-segment sensitivity, the perpatient/per-segment specificity, the per-patient/per-segment PPV and the per-patient/per-segment NPV were 100%/90%, 71%/98%, 95%/88% and 100%/97%, respectively. The image quality was better in the HR < 65 group than in the HR >= 65 group (p = 0.001), but there was no difference in diagnostic performance between the two groups. The mean effective radiation doses were lower in the HR < 65 or HRV < 15 group (p < 0.0001): 5.5 versus 6.7 mSv for the mean HR groups and 5.3 versus 9.3 mSv for the HRV groups., CONCLUSION: Dual-source CT coronary angiography is a highly accurate modality in the clinical setting. Better image quality and a significant radiation reduction are being rendered in the lower HR group.",Excluded
639,"Is treatment of hemorrhagic radiation cystitis with hyperbaric oxygen effective? Objective: We report our own experience with the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for the management of postradiation hemorrhagic cystitis. Method(s): We reviewed retrospectively 14 patients from 2001 to 2007 with different pelvic organ malignancies who developed radiation cystitis after irradiation. Patients received 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 min bottom time, once a day, 7 days a week for at least 1 month. In principle, 30 HBO treatments per course were performed. After every course of HBO treatments, therapeutic effect was evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up of all patients was 18 months (range: 1-6 years). Result(s): Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (treatment group, n = 10) and group 2 (without treatment, n = 4). The mean duration between the onset of hematuria and the beginning of HBO therapy was 8.9 months (range: 3-34). Group 2 did not receive HBO because they were not healthy enough. Only 2 patients (20%) of group 1 recovered from their hemorrhagic cystitis. Group 1 had a significantly lower cure rate of postirradiation hemorrhagic cystitis in comparison to group 2. Conclusion(s): Our experience with the use of HBO did not yield favorable results. Randomized well-controlled studies are needed. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
1098,"Patient radiation exposure during diagnostic and therapeutic interventional neuroradiology procedures PURPOSE: Increasing in number and complexity, interventional neuroradiology (INR) procedures are becoming an important source of radiation exposure for patients. In accordance with the ALARA principle, radiation exposure during INR procedures should be curtailed as much as possible while reaching successful treatment outcomes. Moreover, the extent of radiation exposure should be one outcome measure used to assess new technologies and procedural efficacy, and training programs should include techniques for exposure limitation. This study provides a methodology and preliminary data to assess radiation exposure during different INR procedure types., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing endovascular procedures in two biplanar dedicated neuroangiography suites at a major academic medical center were monitored according to procedure type, pathological indication, fluoroscopy time and machine-generated patient dose estimates between April 2006 and July 2008., RESULTS: 1678 patients underwent cerebral arteriography during the study period. Women (62.1%) accounted for the majority of patients, but men (38.9%) were more likely to undergo an interventional procedure than women (32.8%). Diagnostic studies accounted for 64.9% of procedures. Variable exposures were found between diagnostic and interventional procedures. Exposure differed depending on indications for the procedure and procedure type., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is an increasingly important consideration in the development of minimally invasive neurological procedures including cerebral angiography and INR. The type of procedure and lesion type allow the practitioner to estimate radiation exposure. Such information informs the clinical decision making process. Normative data should be collected and used for comparison purposes as one measure of technical and procedural success.",Excluded
485,"Diagnostic capability and radiation dose of cone beam CT dacryocystography in different scanning fields of view in healthy volunteers OBJECTIVES: Cone beam CT dacryocystography (CBCT-DCG) is a new imaging technique for assessing the lacrimal drainage system (LDS). The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the diagnostic capability and radiation dose of CBCT-DCG in different scanning fields of view (FOV) to evaluate the possibilities of the reduction of radiation dose. METHOD(S): Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent CBCT-DCG in an upright position. The first five subjects were scanned using the scanning FOV of 11x10 cm (Group A), then 8x8 cm (Group B), and the last five subjects 5x5.5 cm (Group C). The image quality and diagnostic validity of different groups were evaluated by two experienced otolaryngologists. The effective dose of each group was calculated and compared. RESULT(S): All images showed good delineation of the LDS and its surrounding structures. With regard to the image quality and diagnostic validity, no differences were found among different groups. Compared with Group A, the effective radiation dose for Group B (38.40 muSv) was 38.54% lower and that for Group C (17.12 muSv) was 72.60% lower. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial reduction of the effective dose for CBCT-DCG in healthy volunteer by decreasing FOV is possible without compromising the diagnostic capability. CBCT-DCG is a potential valid first-line imaging test for the evaluation of LDS, and it permits functional assessment of lacrimal drainage.",Excluded
259,"Dose reduction using digital fluoroscopy versus digital subtraction angiography in endovascular aneurysm repair: A prospective randomized trial OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) can result in high radiation dose to patients and operators. This prospective randomized study aimed to assess whether patient radiation dose sustained during EVAR could be decreased by predominantly using digital fluoroscopy (DF) vs the standard technique using digital subtraction angiography (DSA)., METHODS: Between February 2011 and June 2017, patients with EVAR of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to a standard treatment DSA cohort or a DF cohort in which two or fewer DSA acquisitions were allowed for confirmatory imaging. Primary end points included dose-area product (DAP) and cumulative air kerma. Secondary end points included technical success and conversion to DSA standard treatment (if DF was inadequate for visualization)., RESULTS: For all 43 patients enrolled (26 in the DF cohort, 17 in the DSA cohort), technical success was 100%. Of the 26 DF patients, 5 (19%) required conversion to the DSA cohort. In an intention-to-treat analysis, mean DAP was significantly lower in the DF cohort than in the DSA cohort (132 vs 174 Gy.cm2; P = .04). When patients were separated by number of DSA acquisitions (two or fewer vs three or more), mean DAP decreased 41% (109 vs 185 Gy.cm2; P = .005) and cumulative air kerma decreased 40% (578 vs 964 mGy; P = .004)., CONCLUSIONS: In most patients (81%), DF or limited DSA was adequate for visualization during EVAR. In both intention-to-treat DF and limited-DSA cohorts, mean DAP was significantly decreased. If image quality allows, a DF-only or limited-DSA approach to EVAR decreases radiation dose.

246,"3D histomorphometric quantification of trabecular bones by computed microtomography using synchrotron radiation Conventional bone histomorphometry is an important method for quantitative evaluation of bone microstructure. X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved. The results obtained could be used in forming the basis for comparison of the bone microarchitecture and can be a valuable tool for predicting bone fragility. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

558,"The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment and the space endurance record-breaking mice The Italian Space Agency, in line with its scientific strategies and the National Utilization Plan for the International Space Station (ISS), contracted Thales Alenia Space Italia to design and build a spaceflight payload for rodent research on ISS: the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space. Unfortunately, during the MDS mission, one PTN-Tg and two Wt mice died due to health status or payload-related reasons. The remaining mice showed a normal behavior throughout the experiment and appeared in excellent health conditions at landing. During the experiment, the mice health conditions and their water and food consumption were daily checked. Upon landing mice were sacrificed, blood parameters measured and tissues dissected for subsequent analysis. To obtain as much information as possible on microgravity-induced tissue modifications, we organized a Tissue Sharing Program: 20 research groups from 6 countries participated. In order to distinguish between possible effects of the MDS housing conditions and effects due to the near-zero gravity environment, a ground replica of the flight experiment was performed at the University of Genova. Control tissues were collected also from mice maintained on Earth in standard vivarium cages.",Excluded

The number and locus of intestinal metaplasia in the gastric region induced by 2,000 rads of X-ray were greater in the male than in the female. Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones. Therefore, it is likely that male sex hormones are promoting while female sex hormones are inhibiting the development of intestinal metaplasia.",Included

At presentation, males reported severe erectile dysfunction that was significantly associated with age. However, only in sexual desire was the difference between baseline and phase 3 significant. In females, an improvement was observed in all parameters of FSFI between phase 1 and 3. Females with stage III disease achieved lower scores in almost all parameters of FSFI than those with stage II. Finally, although a quarter of patients reported elevated depression scores, depression was not related to sexual function., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of cancer patients experience intense levels of sexual dysfunction and depression throughout radiotherapy and the subsequent year.

Of 67 cases without clinically suspicious nodes at level IV or V, 11 cases (16%, 11 of 67) had pathologically proven lymphatic metastasis to level IV or V. Only a nodal staging above N2b was significantly relevant with the higher rate of level IV or V lymph node metastasis (p=0.025). In this series, selective ND, combined with proper adjuvant therapy, achieved regional control and survival rates comparable to comprehensive ND in patients under the N stage of cN2a OSCC.

1121,"Robot-assisted intravertebral augmentation corrects local kyphosis more effectively than a conventional fluoroscopy-guided technique OBJECTIVE Intravertebral augmentation (IVA) is a reliable minimally invasive technique for treating Magerl type A vertebral body fractures. However, poor correction of kyphotic angulation, the risk of cement leakage, and significant exposure to radiation (for the surgeon, the operating room staff, and the patient) remain significant issues. The authors conducted a study to assess the value of robot-assisted IVA (RA-IVA) for thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective, single-center study of patients who had undergone RA-IVA or conventional fluoroscopy-guided IVA (F-IVA) for thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. Installation and operating times, guidance accuracy, residual local kyphosis, degree of restoration of vertebral body height, incidence of cement leakage, rate of morbidity, length of hospital stay, and radiation-related data were recorded. RESULTS Data obtained in 30 patients who underwent RA-IVA were compared with those obtained in 30 patients who underwent F-IVA during the same period (the surgical indications were identical, but the surgeons were different). The mean +/- SD installation time in the RA-IVA group (24 +/- 7.5 minutes) was significantly shorter (p = 0.005) than that in the F-IVA group (26 +/- 8 minutes). The mean operating time for the RA-IVA group (52 +/- 11 minutes) was significantly longer (p = 0.026) than that for the F-IVA group (30 +/- 11 minutes). All RA-IVAs and F-IVAs were Ravi's scale grade A (no pedicle breach). The mean degree of residual local kyphosis (4.7degree +/- 3.15degree) and the percentage of vertebral body height restoration (63.6% +/- 21.4%) were significantly better after RA-IVA than after F-IVA (8.4degree +/- 5.4degree and 30% +/- 34%, respectively). The incidence of cement leakage was significantly lower in the RA-IVA group (p < 0.05). The mean length of hospital stay after surgery was 3.2 days for both groups. No surgery-related complications occurred in either group. With RA-IVA, the mean radiation exposure was 438 +/- 147 mGy x cm for the patient and 30 +/- 17 mGy for the surgeon. CONCLUSIONS RA-IVA provided better vertebral body fracture correction than the conventional F-IVA. However, RA-IVA requires more time than F-IVA.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Excluded
434,"BCL11b gene is targeted by structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mature T-cell lymphoma Background: BCL11b is a transcriptional repressor required for the differentiation and survival of alpha/beta T lymphocytes and the development of the corticospinal motor neurons in the central nervous system. It is likely involved in cancergenesis either as a tumorsuppressor gene via inactivating mutations or deletions in murine irradiation induced lymphomas or as a transcriptional deregulator via recurrent chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study we present data on BCL11b gene configuration and protein expression in series of mature T-cell lymphoma. Design(s): 265 mature T-cell lymphoma, namely 119 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), 54 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 44 anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 13 extranodal T/NK lymphoma, 2 hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, 6 T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia and 27 mycosis fungoides samples were selected from the files of the Institute of Pathology, Wuerzburg, Germany. All samples were classified according to the WHO classification criteria and studied for presence of genetic aberrations affecting BCL11b gene by newly designed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay in tissue microarray formate. BCL11b protein expression was tested by immunohistochemistry using rat monoclonal antibody 25B6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Result(s): Chromosomal breakpoint in the BCL11b genomic region was detected in 3(1%) out of 265 mature T-cell lymphoma samples. All cases were classified as PTCL, NOS and presented with lymphadenopathy and cutaneous infiltration in 2 male and 1 female adult patients, respectively. One of the samples carried concurrent breakpoint in TCR alpha/sigma, suggesting a presence of an inv(14)(q11;q32), affecting the TCR alpha/sigma and BCL11b loci. Genomic gain in BCL11b/14q32 was recognized in 84 (32%) samples, most frequently affecting PTCL, NOS. Varying level of BCL11b protein expression was observed in 67% of the samples, showing no correlation to the presence or absence of an underlying genetic aberration. Conclusion(s): Our study identified BCL11b gene as a novel recurrent, though infrequent translocation partner in PTCL, NOS, affected also by numerical genetic aberrations. BCL11b protein is commonly expressed in mature T-cell lymphoma however it's biological and clinical significance remains unclear and merit further studies.",Excluded
9,"Integration of magnetoencephalography-generated functional brain maps into dose planning during arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can delineate critical regions of the cortex and facilitate conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose planning. Despite the substantial role of Gamma Knife R SRS in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management, MEG-generated maps of critical regions have never been utilized to improve dose planning., PURPOSE: To assess the value of integrating functional brain mapping using MEG with dose planning during treatment of brain AVMs with SRS., METHODS: This case series encompassed 5 patients with motor region AVMs. Noninvasive eloquent cortex mapping was achieved using a whole-head 306-channel Neuromag R Vectorview MEG System 5-10 days before SRS. On the day of SRS, the functional brain maps were integrated onto the intraoperative dose planning magnetic resonance imaging for Leksell GammaPlan R version 10. The median AVM volume treated was 12.7 cm(3), and 18 Gy was the median margin dose., RESULTS: Functional image integration of MEG improved the recognition of critical brain structures adjacent to the AVM. This facilitated anatomical planning designed to reduce the dose to adjacent critical structures while maintaining a therapeutic dose to the AVM target. The 5 patients had no adverse radiation effects during the follow-up., CONCLUSION: Coregistration of MEG data improves the accuracy and dose sparing needed for optimal planning during Gamma Knife SRS.

745,"The effect of intensity-modulated radiotherapy on radiation-induced second malignancies PURPOSE: To compare intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in terms of carcinogenic risk for actual clinical scenarios., METHOD AND MATERIALS: Clinically equivalent IMRT plans were generated for prostate, breast, and head-and-neck cases treated with 3D-CRT. Two possible dose-response models for radiocarcinogenesis were generated based on A-bomb survivor data corrected for fractionation. Dose-volume histogram analysis was used to determine dose and its distribution to nontargeted tissues within the planning CT scan volume and thermoluminescent dosimetry for the rest of the body. Carcinogenic estimates were calculated with and without a correction factor accounting for cancer patients' advanced age and reduced longevity., RESULTS: For the model assuming a plateau in risk above 2-Gy single-fraction-equivalent (SFE), IMRT and 3D-CRT produced risks of 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, for prostate; 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively, for nasopharynx; 1% each for tonsil; and 1.4-2.2% and 1.5-1.6%, respectively, depending on technique, for breast. Assuming a reduction in risk above 2-Gy SFE, risks for IMRT and 3D-CRT were 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, for prostate; 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively, for nasopharynx; 1% each for tonsil; and 1.3-1.8% vs. 1.3-1.6%, respectively, for breast. Applying a correction factor of 0.5 for cancer patients halved these risks and their relative differences., CONCLUSIONS: Carcinogenic risks were comparable in absolute terms between modalities. Risks are dependant on technique used. Risks with IMRT are influenced by monitor unit demand and are therefore software/hardware dependant. The dose-response model accounting for cell killing at higher doses fitted best with actual observed risks.",Excluded
734,"Paragangliomas: presentation and management by radiotherapy at the Prince of Wales Hospital INTRODUCTION: Paragangliomas are commonly treated with surgery, while radiotherapy is reserved for those that are inoperable or have relapsed. However, this retrospective study aims to determine whether radiotherapy is a viable initial treatment for paragangliomas., METHODS: Of 73 tumours researched, 44 were diagnosed and treated from January 1967 to December 2012 at the Radiation Oncology Department at the Prince of Wales Hospital and thus were eligible for analysis. Median follow-up time was 3.5 years with a range of 1 to 40 years. Thirty-four tumours were treated with radiotherapy only, and 10 tumours were treated with both surgical resection and radiotherapy. Local control and cause-specific survival were the primary end points measured., RESULTS: Five-year local control rate for the population of 44 lesions was 89%; it was 100% in the group treated by radiotherapy alone, but only 50% in the group treated by surgery followed by radiotherapy, with radiation used for salvage. The difference in control rates between these two subset groups was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.001). Cause-specific survival rates for this eligible population at 5 and 10 years were 98% and 90%, respectively. After initial radiotherapy, 4 patients had improved cranial nerve function, there was clinical improvement in tinnitus, and one new cranial nerve deficit developed where a high dose was used., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy has high local control rates and few complications. The local control and complication rates compare favourably to surgery. Copyright © 2014 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
1126,"Assessment of cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease by spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging To evaluate the utility of arterial spin-labeled blood flow magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of cerebral blood flow abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease, arterial spin-labeled blood flow images in 16 contiguous 5-mm axial sections were acquired in 18 patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease and 11 age-matched controls. Blood flow images from all subjects were transformed to a standard anatomical space for voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis. High quality blood flow images were obtained from all but 1 subject. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant flow decreases relative to control subjects in temporal, parietal, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices. Increased severity of disease, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination, correlated with posterior parietal and posterior cingulate decreases but not temporal decreases. Arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging was found to be an effective tool for characterizing flow decreases accompanying Alzheimer's disease. The absence of ionizing radiation or injection and the ability to obtain high quality anatomical images within the same scanning session make arterial spin labeling an attractive technique for the study of Alzheimer's disease, for the evaluation of pharmacological therapies, and, possibly, for early diagnosis.",Excluded

Bone mineral density (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), bone biochemistry (from blood and urine samples), and renal stone risk factors were evaluated before and after flight. Data were analyzed in two groups, based on available resistance exercise equipment. The response of bone mineral density to flight was the same for men and women, and the typical decrease in bone mineral density (whole body and/or regional) after flight was not observed for either sex for those using an Advanced Resistive Exercise Device. Bone biochemistry, specifically markers of formation and resorption, generally responded similarly in male and female astronauts. The response of urinary supersaturation risk to space flight was not significantly different between men and women, although risks were typically increased after flight in both groups and risks were generally greater in men than in women before and after flight. Overall, the bone and renal stone responses of men and women to space flight were not different.",Excluded
1134,"Superficial Femoral Artery Intervention by Single Transpedal Arterial Access BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is frequently seen and can be treated with percutaneous interventions, traditionally via femoral artery access. There are limited reports of transpedal artery access for peripheral artery interventions, but none to date describing routine primary transpedal artery approach for SFA stenting. METHOD(S): In this preliminary study, we report 4 patients who underwent successful endovascular SFA stenting using a single transpedal artery access via a new ultra-low profile 6 Fr sheath (Glidesheath Slender; Terumo Corporation). RESULT(S): All patients underwent successful SFA stenting without complication. Procedure time varied from 51 to 72 minutes. The mean contrast amount used was 56 mL; mean fluoroscopy time was 21 minutes; mean radiation dose was 91 mGy. At 1-month follow-up, duplex ultrasonography showed that all pedal arteries had remained patent. CONCLUSION(S): Transpedal artery approach as a primary approach to SFA stenting appears feasible and safe. Comparative trials with standard percutaneous femoral approach are warranted.",Excluded
910,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
887,"3D Printed Personalized Guide Plate in the Femoral Head Core Decompression Objective. To investigate the feasibility of using 3D printed personalized guide plates in core decompression procedures for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Methods. The clinical data of 8 patients undergoing femoral head core decompression from January to December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Three-dimensional (3D) images of the patients were reconstructed from the CT scan data taken preoperatively. From the data obtained, puncture position, drill hole, and depth were evaluated, and individualized 3D puncture guide plates were designed using Mimics 21.0 software. During the operation, the needle went through the hole of the guide plate, the depth of the drill was controlled, and the obtained bone tissues were sent for pathological evaluation. Intraoperative X-ray and postoperative pathological results were used to evaluate the success of the puncture. Results. The individualized guide plates used for core compression on the 8 patients were well fitted with the anatomic structure of the puncture site, and the direction and depth of the needle insertion were consistent with the preoperative design. The operation time was about 15-22 mins. The position of the decompression tunnel was the same as the designed plate. The postoperative pathology showed necrotic bone tissue. There were no postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and fracture. Conclusion. The 3D printed individualized guide plate can simplify core decompression and would make this procedure more accurate, safe, and quick, in addition to obtaining necrotic tissues for pathological examination.Copyright © 2020 Liangliang Cheng et al.",Excluded

225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded
877,"Gamma radiation tolerance in different life stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster PURPOSE: Insects are known to have higher levels of radiation tolerance than mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included
694,"Postoperative chemotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy for thoracic esophageal cancer: A prospective randomized clinical trial Background: Neither postoperative radiotherapy nor chemotherapy alone provided a survival benefit after curative esophagectomy for esophageal squamous carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Of 103 consecutive patients who underwent potentially curative esophagectomy for esophageal squamous carcinoma, 45 patients with advanced cancers without preoperative adjuvant treatments were prospectively randomized to two groups; postoperative chemotherapy alone (Group A, n = 23) and postoperative radio/chemotherapy (Group B,n = 22). In Group A, cisplatin (CDDP) (50 mg/m2) was given by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/m2) was given daily by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 weeks. In Group B, in addition to the same chemotherapeutic regimen of Group A, 50 Gy of radiotherapy was given to the mediastinum over 5 weeks. The immunohistochemical staining of tumoral p53 and microvessel density was undertaken to correlate to the radio/chemosensitivity. Result(s): There were no significant differences in the clinicopathologic characteristics between the two groups. The median dose of 5-FU and CDDP administered were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean (SD) dose of radiotherapy in Group B was 42 + 10 Gy. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in Group A were 100, 63 and 38% and those in Group B were 80, 58 and 50%, respectively (P = 0.97). In each group, four patients succumbed to locoregional recurrences. Tumoral p53 was immunohistochemically negative in 43% in Group A and 77% in Group B (P = 0.03), indicating that many patients in Group B might be potentially sensitive to radiochemotherapy. The 3- and 5-year survival rates (75 and 64%) of patients with p53 negative expression (n = 18) were significantly (P = 0.03) better than those with p53 positive expression {n = 27, 44 and 26%). The long-term survival was better for patients with p53 negative tumours than those with p53 positive tumours in Group B (P = 0.06 by long-rank test, P < 0.05 by Generalized-Wilcoxon test). However, the long-term survival was not different between the patients who had p53 negative and positive tumours in Group A (P = 0.19). These data suggest that there were no survival advantage for patients receiving radiotherapy in Group B, instead p53 negative tumours appeared to have a favorable prognosis. Conclusion(s): Postoperative radiotherapy administered concurrently with chemotherapy does not provide a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Tumoral p53 expression has a predictive value for survival in patients treated with postoperative radio/chemotherapy. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

The image quality was evaluated with a four-point grading scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = poor, 4 = very poor or non-diagnostic). The total effective dose and the total dose length product between the two groups were recorded respectively. The CTCA enhanced effective dose, dose length product, and the CT volume dosage index (CTDIvol) between the two groups were recorded respectively., RESULTS: A total of 157 stents were implanted, there were 78 stents in group A and 79 stents in group B, and the value of the image quality was (1.3 +/- 0.6) scores in group A and (1.4 +/- 0.6) scores in group B (P > 0.05).

Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) is effective in treating unilateral TN; however, outcomes of bilateral TN treated by GKRS have not been well evaluated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term GKRS outcomes of bilateral TN at our institution and compare with our published treatment outcomes of unilateral TN. Copyright:, Methods: Between 2000 and 2006, eight patients with bilateral TN were treated with GKRS. Data available on seven patients were collected. Facial pain outcomes were defined using the Barrow Neurological Institute pain intensity scale. Outcomes and toxicities were compared to published outcomes of unilateral TN patients treated with GKRS at our institution., Results: The incidence of bilateral TN in our series is 2.3%. Treatment outcomes were excellent in 5/14, good in 1/14, and poor in 8/14. Median follow-up time was 58 months. Median time-to-failure was 38 months. Pain control rate was 80% at 12 months and 65% at 36 months. Bothersome side effects were seen in 4/14 nerves treated. Compared with our long-term unilateral TN cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome, time-to-failure, or rate of toxicity., Conclusion: Bilateral TN is rare, and effective treatment is crucial to improve the quality of life of those afflicted.

309,"Treatment outcomes of T4 locally advanced head and neck cancers with soft tissue invasion or bone and cartilage invasion PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S):: T4 locally advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) with bone and cartilage invasion (BCI) traditionally have been treated with resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

All cases were previously untreated. During follow-up, regular MRI examinations were used to detect any changes in tumor size and estimate the local long-term tumor control rate. Treatment-related complications were also recorded. During follow-up, systemic dissemination was observed in two patients, one of whom died of metastases. The most frequent complication was retinal detachment (17.1%). Three patients required enucleation. Cumulative 1-year and 3-year local tumor growth control rates were 97% and 83%, respectively. The mean and median times to local tumor progression were 48.0 and 51.7 months, respectively. Gamma knife surgery may be a suitable alternative for the treatment of low-volume uveal tumors without intraocular complications, as the control rate and long-term outcomes compare favorably with those of surgical excision and brachytherapy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

415,"Limitations on upper bound dose to adults due to intake of 129I in drinking water and a total diet-implications relative to the proposed Yucca Mountain high level radioactive waste repository The purpose of this report is to comment on the potential annual doses due to the intake by adults of I, an important radionuclide in the proposed high-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain. An often overlooked, but significant, factor is that, in this case, the ground water, which would be the primary transport vehicle for any releases, contains relatively high concentrations of stable iodine (127I); in fact, the median concentration in the ground water in the vicinity of the proposed repository is 5.0 microg L-1. In comparison, the maximum concentration of 129I in the ground water, due to potential releases of 129I during the first 10,000 y following closure of the repository, is estimated to be approximately 3.7 x 10(-7) Bq L-1 (approximately 10(-5) pCi L-1). This would result in a 127I to 129I ratio in the water of almost 90 million to one. Assuming no other sources of these two isotopes were being consumed, this would place an upper bound on the annual committed thyroid dose of 1.2 x 10(-1) mSv (1.2 x 10(-1) mrem), less than one thousandth of the Ground Water Protection Standard of 4 mrem y-1. When the additional intake of stable and radioactive iodine in other components of the diet is considered, the overall ratio of 127I to 129I would be more than 2 billion to one. The would place an upper bound on the annual committed effective dose of approximately 2.5 x 10(-8) mSv (approximately 2.5 x 10(-6) mrem), less than one millionth of the Individual Protection Standard of 0.15 mSv (15 mrem).",Excluded

We prospectively investigated the differences in radiation exposure related to collimation in Medial Branch Block (MBB)., METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 62 MBBs at L3, 4 and 5. After the patient was laid in the prone position on the operating table, MBB was conducted and only AP projections of the fluoroscope were used. Based on a concealed random number table, MBB was performed with (collimation group) and without (control group) collimation. The data on the patient's age, height, gender, laterality (right/left), radiation absorbed dose (RAD), exposure time, distance from the center of the field to the operator, and effective dose (ED) at the side of the table and at the operator's chest were collected. The brightness of the fluoroscopic image was evaluated with histogram in Photoshop., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, height, weight, male to female ratio, laterality, time, distance and brightness of fluoroscopic image. The area of the fluoroscopic image with collimation was 67% of the conventional image.

351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded
1139,"The perceived transmittance of inhomogeneous surfaces and media A series of experiments was performed to determine how the visual system computes the transmittance of inhomogeneous surfaces and media. Previous work (Anderson, B. L. (1999) Stereoscopic surface perception. Neuron, 26, 919-928; Anderson, B. L. (2003) The role of occlusion in the perception of depth, lightness, and opacity. Psychological Review, 110, 762-784) has suggested that the visual system employs a transmittance anchoring principle in determining when transparency is perceived. This principle states that the visual system interprets the highest contrast region along contours and surfaces as a region in plain view and uses this anchor as a reference point for transparency computations. In particular, recent work has shown that the transmittance of homogeneous transparent surfaces is well described by a ratio of contrasts model (Singh, M., & Anderson, B. L. (2002). Toward a perceptual theory of transparency. Psychological Review, 109, 492-519). In this model, the transmittance of a transparent surface is determined by the contrast of a transparent image region normalized by the contrast of the region in plain view. Here, a series of experiments is reported that assesses this model for inhomogeneous transparent surfaces that vary in both space and time. The results of these experiments reveal that transmittance anchoring has both a spatial and temporal component, and that the perceived transmittance of transparent surfaces is well described by a ratio of perceived contrasts model.",Excluded
273,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible. Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG for most patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

574,"Skin Dose Reduction by Layer-Stacking Irradiation in Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for Parotid Tumors Background: Layer-stacking irradiation (LSI) results in the accumulation of multiple small spread-out Bragg peaks along the beam direction. Although the superiority of LSI to conventional passive irradiation (CPI) regarding normal tissue sparing is theoretically evident, the clinical benefit of LSI has not been demonstrated. Here, we compared LSI with CPI using the same treatment planning-computed tomography images used for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). Method(s): Twenty-one parotid tumors were analyzed. The clinical target volume (CTV) 1 and CTV2 encompassed the parotid grand and the tumor, respectively. CTV1 and CTV2 received 36 Gy (RBE: relative biological effectiveness) in nine fractions and 64 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions, respectively, using either LSI or CPI. CTV coverage was assessed by DX%, which is the dose covering at least X% of the target volume. Skin dose was assessed by SX, which is the skin surface area receiving at least X Gy (RBE). Result(s): For CTV1 and CTV2, there were no significant differences in D2% between LSI and CPI. D50% and D98% were slightly higher for CPI; however, the absolute difference between the two methods was <3%. S10-S60 (in increments of 10) were significantly lower for LSI than for CPI (P < 0.001 for all parameters). LSI was associated with a significant trend toward dose reduction at the skin area irradiated with a higher dose by CPI (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): LSI achieved better skin sparing than CPI without sacrificing target volume coverage in parotid tumor patients.© Copyright © 2020 Kubo, Kubota, Oike, Kawamura, Sakai, Imamura, Komatsu, Miyasaka, Sato, Musha, Okano, Shirai, Saitoh, Chikamatsu and Ohno.",Excluded

We also assessed the relationship existing between each of the aforementioned proteins and intratumoral microvessel densities (IMD) which have been previously reported (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2000;48:17-25. Material(s) and Method(s): Pretherapeutic tumor biopsies from 95 patients were immunohistochemically stained and their immunoreactivities evaluated semi-quantitatively. The statistical analyses included Cox regression for calculating risk ratios of survival endpoints and logistic regression for determining odds ratios for the development of distant metastasis. Result(s): Local tumor control as well as disease-free and overall survival were independent of protein expression levels, whereas combined TGFalpha and EGFR immunoreactivities were closely related to IMD (P=0.003). The expression levels of these two proteins were also correlated to each other (P=0.015). Expression of PDGF-B occurred in 54% of cases and was associated with an increase in the risk of developing distant metastasis (P=0.011). Conclusion(s): Tumoral levels of TGFalpha, EGFR and PDGF-A/B are not predictive of radioresponsiveness in oropharyngeal cancers. The association between IMD and immunoreactivity for TGFalpha and EGFR indicates the involvement of these proteins in the promotion of angiogenesis in these tumors. PDGF-B should be further evaluated as a prognostic marker for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1223,"Focal radiation therapy of brain metastases after complete surgical resection Brain metastases are a frequent occurrence in cancer patients and result in significant morbidity and mortality. The three main treatments for brain metastases include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy, alone or in combination. After resection alone, local recurrence rates are high. Whole brain radiation therapy can decrease the probability of recurrence; however, this has some disadvantages. Focal radiation therapy (FRT) may provide many of the same benefits without some of these disadvantages. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed patients with single brain metastases treated with FRT after surgery. Doses ranged from 14 Gy as single dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to 54 Gy in 27 2-Gy fractions as conformal fractionated radiotherapy. Four of the seven patients had a same-site recurrence, with an average time to recurrence of 115.5 d. Median dose in the patients that had same-site recurrence was 42 Gy. One of these patients is currently living. Two patients did not have recurrence, and one patient had a recurrence at a different site within the brain. The low rate of out-of-field recurrences during the patients life indicates focal radiation may be a reasonable therapeutic alternative. Given the number of patients with same-site recurrences, wide field margins around the tumor volume or higher radiation doses than those typically used in palliative regimens may be useful in post-excisional FRT. Additionally, we found that a longer delay in the initiation of FRT after initial diagnosis may result in a decreased time to same-site recurrence. However, further studies are warranted given the small number of patients in this study.",Excluded
867,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

770,"Minimal-invasive bracing of the lumbar spine using an interspinous spacer Introduction: The Superion interspinous spacer (VertiFlex, Inc. San Clemente, CA. USA) is a minimal-invasive spacer for limitation of extension and for indirect expansion of the Neuro Foramen in patients with intermittend neurogenic claudication in moderate spinal canal stenosis. The implant is placed over a midline access with protection of the supraspinous ligament. We introduce indications, basic priniples of biomechanics and clinical results. Material(s) and Method(s): The Superion Spacer has been implanted in 12 male and 2 female patients with an average age of 74 years (69-79 years) from 3/2008 to 4/2009. Operated levels were L3/4 in 6 cases and L4/5 in 7 cases. In one patient we implanted the spacer in 2 levels, L3/4 and L4/5. The clinical outcome has been determined using the ZCQ (Zurich Claudication Questionaire), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) preoperatively as well as 3, 6 and 12 Months postoperatively. Result(s): In the one year follow up we examined and documented the maintained distraction or loss of correction using plain x-rays. Beside one fracture of the Spinous Process leading to to the abort of the operation, no further complications could be identified. The average OR-time was 41 minutes (30-58 Min.). The clinical outcome scores in the 1-year follow up were improved compared to the preoperative basic value: ZCQ Symptoms improved from 3,81 to 1,52, ZCQ physical function improved from 2,68 to 1,23 and the ZCQ patient satisfaction to1,2. An improvement of the ODI from 45,3 to 14,1 and of the VAS back pain from 2,5 to 0,7 could be observed while the VAS leg pain improved from 3,9 to 0,5 in the left leg ; from 3,4 to 1,9 in the right leg. Conclusion(s): The Superion Interspinous Spacer is an implant for treatment of the moderate spinal Canal stenosis as an alternative to conservative treatment. The minimal-invasive technique, the conservation of the supraspinous ligament and the improvement of the outcome parameters legitimate the use of the spacer in selected patients with symptoms of intermittend spinal claudication.

767,"The Role of Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein (PTHrP) in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Mechanistic Implications for Osteoporosis Development Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients, but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who can lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite the important implications for Spaceflight travelers and bedridden patients, the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development, and has been proposed as a mechanosensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss, trabecular and calvarial osteoblasts (TOs and COs) from Pthrp +/+ and -/- mice were subjected to actual Spaceflight for 6 days (Foton M3 satellite). Pthrp +/+, +/- and -/- osteoblasts were also exposed to simulated microgravity for periods varying from 6 days to 6 weeks. While COs displayed little change in viability in 0g, viability of all TOs rapidly decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Furthermore, Pthrp+/+ TOs displayed a sharp viability decline after 2 weeks at 0g. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days in simulated 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins, apoptosis/survival molecules, bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins, chemokines, insulin-like growth factor family members and Wnt-related signalling molecules. 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlapped those caused by Pthrp ablation in normal gravity, and pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 not only reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced effects in Pthrp+/+ TOs but maintained viability over 6-week exposure to microgravity. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs.",Excluded
416,"Gravity and Mastoid Effusion BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic mastoid effusions have recently been observed in astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight. In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6degree head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response., METHODS: The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest., RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control)., CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions. Formation of mastoid effusions during head down tilt bed rest is not prevented by daily 30 minutes short-arm intermittent or continuous centrifugation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

18,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE. RESULT(S):Male/Female (8/8). Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
613,"Does Exposure to Computed Tomography Contrast Media Increase Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease? BACKGROUND There are many studies on acute kidney injury (AKI) after exposure to contrast media in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, whether the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increases after exposure to contrast media in the long term, regardless of development of AKI after such exposure, has not been studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS The electronic health records of patients diagnosed with CKD and followed up from 2014 to 2018 at a tertiary university hospital were retrospectively collected. Patients were divided into patients who progressed to ESRD (ESRD group) and those who did not (non-ESRD group). Patients in the non-ESRD group were matched 1: 1 to those in the ESRD group by using disease risk score generation and matching. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of contrast media exposure on progression to ESRD. RESULTS In total, 179 patients were enrolled per group; 178 (99.4%) were in CKD stage 3 or above in both groups. Average serum creatinine was 4.31+/-3.02 mg/dl and 3.64+/-2.55 mg/dl in the ESRD and non-ESRD groups, respectively (p=0.242). Other baseline characteristics were not statistically significant, except for the number of times contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed (0.00 [Interquartile range (IQR) 0.00-2.00] in the ESRD group and 0.00 [IQR 0.00-1.00] in the non-ESRD group [p=0.006]); in multivariate logistic regression, this number (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08-1.47, p=0.006) was significantly related to progression to ESRD. CONCLUSIONS The use of CECT increased the risk of ESRD 1.2-fold in advanced and stable CKD outpatients after 5-year follow-up.",Excluded

826,"Evaluation of functionally weighted dose-volume parameters for thoracic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) using CT ventilation For the purpose of reducing radiation pneumontisis (RP), four-dimensional CT (4DCT)-based ventilation can be used to reduce functionally weighted lung dose. This study aimed to evaluate the functionally weighted dose-volume parameters and to investigate an optimal weighting method to realize effective planning optimization in thoracic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Forty patients treated with SABR were analyzed. Ventilation images were obtained from 4DCT using deformable registration and Hounsfield unit-based calculation. Functionally-weighted mean lung dose (fMLD) and functional lung fraction receiving at least x Gy (fVx) were calculated by two weighting methods: thresholding and linear weighting. Various ventilation thresholds (5th-95th, every 5th percentile) were tested. The predictive accuracy for CTCAE grade2 pneumonitis was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic analysis. AUC values varied from 0.459 to 0.570 in accordance with threshold and dose-volume metrics. A combination of 25th percentile threshold and fV30 showed the best result (AUC: 0.570). AUC values with fMLD, fV10, fV20, and fV40 were 0.541, 0.487, 0.548 and 0.563 using a 25th percentile threshold. Although conventional MLD, V10, V20, V30 and V40 showed lower AUC values (0.516, 0.477, 0.534, 0.552 and 0.527), the differences were not statistically significant. fV30 with 25th percentile threshold was the best predictor of RP.

130,"Spatial temperature distribution in human hairy and glabrous skin after infrared CO2 laser radiation CO2 lasers have been used for several decades as an experimental non-touching pain stimulator. The laser energy is absorbed by the water content in the most superficial layers of the skin. The deeper located nociceptors are activated by passive conduction of heat from superficial to deeper skin layers. In the current study, a 2D axial finite element model was developed and validated to describe the spatial temperature distribution in the skin after infrared CO2 laser stimulation. The geometry of the model was based on high resolution ultrasound scans. The simulations were compared to the subjective pain intensity ratings from 16 subjects and to the surface skin temperature distributions measured by an infrared camera. The stimulations were sensed significantly slower and less intense in glabrous skin than they were in hairy skin (MANOVA, p < 0.001). The model simulations of superficial temperature correlated with the measured skin surface temperature (r > 0.90, p < 0.001). Of the 16 subjects tested; eight subjects reported pricking pain in the hairy skin following a stimulus of 0.6 J/cm2 (5 W, 0.12 s, d1/e2 = 11.4 mm) only two reported pain to glabrous skin stimulation using the same stimulus intensity. The temperature at the epidermal-dermal junction (depth 50 mum in hairy and depth 133 mum in glabrous skin) was estimated to 46degreeC for hairy skin stimulation and 39degreeC for glabrous skin stimulation. As compared to previous one dimensional heat distribution models, the current two dimensional model provides new possibilities for detailed studies regarding CO2 laser stimulation intensity, temperature levels and nociceptor activation.",Excluded

One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included

The nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission electron microscopic scanning mansoni (FESEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). For the in vitro test with Schistosoma mansoni, the DNHK-loaded PLGA was diluted into the medium, and added at concentrations 10-200 microM to the culture medium containing one adult worm pair. The parasites were kept for 120 h and monitored every 24 h to evaluate their general condition, including: pairing, alterations in motor activity and mortality., RESULTS: The loaded PLGA nanoparticles gave an encapsulation efficiency of 42.2% and showed spherical characteristics in monodisperse polymeric matrix.

We designed this study to evaluate the association between these changes and the use of PPIs and histamine 2-receptor blockers (H2-blockers). We obtained five Sydney System-compliant biopsy specimens from patients recruited into a therapeutic trial for H. pylori. Medication history with details on PPI and H 2-blockers use was collected. Two blinded pathologists graded gastritis and the intensity of putative PPI effects using a 0 to 3 scale. PPI and H2-blocker use was then disclosed and the accuracy of pathologists' assessment was analyzed. There were 138 H. pylori-negative and 104 positive patients. In H. pylori-negative patients the histologic assessment for PPI use had 77.5% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 86.9% and a negative predictive value of 35.9%. In H. pylori-positive patients, sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity 26.1%. Positive and negative predictive values were 55.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Neither glandular dilatations nor parietal cell protrusions related to H2-blocker use. We conclude that these changes are associated with PPI use only in H. pylori-negative subjects. In H. pylori gastritis, so-called PPI-effects were equally prevalent in PPI-users and non-users, indicating that other factors are involved in the induction of oxyntic cell hyperplasia. We suggest that comments regarding the supposed evidence of PPI use are too often wrong to be useful and should be avoided in the diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

902,"Optimizing cancer radiotherapy with 2-deoxy-D-glucose: Dose escalation studies in patients with glioblastoma multiforme Background and Purpose: Higher rates of glucose utilization and glycolysis generally correlate with poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors. Own earlier studies on model systems demonstrated that the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner by selectively sensitizing cancer cells while protecting normal cells. Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that the combination of 2-DG, at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), with large fractions of gamma-radiation was well tolerated in cerebral glioma patients. Since higher 2-DG doses are expected to improve the therapeutic gain, present studies were undertaken to examine the tolerance and safety of escalating 2-DG dose during combined treatment (2-DG + radiotherapy) in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme (WHO criteria) were included in the study. Seven weekly fractions of 60Co gamma-rays (5 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor volume (presurgical CT/MRI evaluation) plus 3 cm margin. Escalating 2-DG doses (200-250-300 mg/kg BW) were administered orally 30 min before irradiation after overnight fasting. Acute toxicity and tolerance were studied by monitoring the vital parameters and side effects. Late radiation damage and treatment responses were studied radiologically and clinically in surviving patients. Result(s): Transient side effects similar to hypoglycemia were observed in most of the patients. Tolerance and patient compliance to the combined treatment were very good up to a 2-DG dose of 250 mg/kg BW. However, at the higher dose of 300 mg/kg BW, two out of six patients were very restless and could not complete treatment, though significant changes in the vital parameters were not observed even at this dose. No significant damage to the normal brain tissue was observed during follow-up in seven out of ten patients who received complete treatment and survived between 11 and 46 months after treatment.

218,"CT-Guided Biopsy of Entirely Endophytic Small Renal Masses: Diagnostic Rates and Complications Using Standard-Dose and Reduced-Dose CT Protocols OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare diagnostic rates and complications using standard-dose and reduced-dose CT protocols for CT-guided biopsies of entirely endophytic small renal masses., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 73 patients with 74 tumors underwent CT-guided biopsy of entirely endophytic small renal masses (<= 4 cm). Diagnostic rates, histologic findings, radiation doses, complication rates, and procedure duration were assessed by retrospective review of charts and images and were compared for the standard-dose and reduced-dose groups., RESULTS: Biopsy was performed using the standard-dose CT protocol (mean reference tube current-exposure time setting, 205.0 +/- 19.0 [SD] mAs) for 43 lesions, and the reduced-dose CT protocol (reference tube current-exposure time setting, 42.0 +/- 7.5 mAs) for 31 lesions. In the reduced-dose group, there were 29 lesions (94%) with diagnostic results. In the standard-dose group, biopsies of 42 lesions (98%) yielded diagnostic results. No complications that needed intervention or hospitalization occurred in either group. The dose-length product (DLP) was significantly higher in the standard-dose group than the reduced-dose group (574 +/- 232 vs 152 +/- 63 mGy x cm, respectively; p < 0.05). The mean procedure duration did not differ significantly for the two groups., CONCLUSION: Biopsy of entirely endophytic small renal masses that is performed with guidance using a reduced-dose CT protocol gives diagnostic results similar to a standard-dose CT protocol without any increase in complication rate or procedure duration.",Excluded
97,"Monochromatic excimer light (308 nm) in patch-stage IA mycosis fungoides Recently, numerous studies have been reported concerning the treatment of early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) with narrowband (311-nm) UVB, claiming a beneficial response. We have used for the first time a 308-nm monochromatic excimer light, a new kind of xenon-chloride lamp, in the treatment of patch stage IA MF. We treated 7 patch lesions in 4 patients with unequivocal clinicopathologic diagnosis of MF. All lesions achieved clinical and histologic complete remission. The number of weekly sessions varied from 4 to 11 (mean 6. 5; median 5.5). The total UVB 308-nm irradiation dose ranged from 5 to 9.3 J/cm2 (mean 7.1 J/cm2; median 7 J/cm2). All lesions remained in stable complete remission after a follow-up of 3 to 28 months. No remarkable side effects were reported. Our preliminary results suggest that monochromatic excimer light phototherapy is a possibly very useful treatment modality in patch stage IA MF.",Excluded
381,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded
123,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the prognostic factors for 840 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who received radiotherapy (RT) and to provide information about improvement in NPC RT techniques. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data from 840 cases of NPC that received RT from January 1996 to December 2001 in our hospital. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the control rate of nasopharynx, the tumor-free survival rate and overall survival. Log-rank test was conducted to determine significance. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to confirm the significance of prognostic factors. Result(s): 1) The total control rates of nasopharynx for 3, 5 and 10 years were 70.6%, 56.7% and 36.6%, respectively. The tumor-free survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 66.8%, 51.8% and 32.0%, respectively. The overall survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 73.8%, 58.6% and 39.4%, respectively. 2) Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, N stage, skull base invasion, cranial nerve invasion, nasal cavity invasion, cervical node metastasis, unilateral/bilateral neck node metastasis, cervical node metastasis position, intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx, external beam radiotherapy method and chemotherapy were significantly associated with the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival, and overall survival (P<0.05). The irradiation dose of nasopharynx was significantly associated with the nasopharynx control rate and overall survival (P<0.05). The tumor-free survival of the patients with carotid sheath involvement was lower than that of the patients without carotid sheath involvement (P<0.05). 3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, unilateral/bilateral cervical node metastasis, and intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx were independent influential factors of the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival. 4) The stratified analysis showed that T2 and T3 patients who received adjuvant high dose intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx presented with a higher control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Male NPC patients with advanced clinical stage (especially T stage) and bilateral cervical node metastasis have a poorer prognosis. Adjuvant intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx can improve the prognosis of T2 and T3 patients.",Excluded
315,"High-pitch versus sequential mode for coronary calcium in individuals with a high heart rate: Potential for dose reduction BACKGROUND: To determine the impact of high-pitch spiral acquisition on radiation dose and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification by coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment with computed tomography in individuals with a high heart rate., METHODS: Of the ROBINSCA trial, 1990 participants with regular rhythm and heart rates >65 beats per minute (bpm) were included. As reference, 390 participants with regular heart rates <=65 bpm were used. All participants underwent prospectively electrocardiographically(ECG)-triggered imaging of the coronary arteries using dual source CT at 120kVp, 80 ref mAs using both high-pitch spiral mode and sequential mode. Radiation dose, Agatston score, number of positive scores, as well as median absolute difference of the Agatston score were determined and participants were stratified into CVD risk categories., RESULTS: A similar percentage of participants with low heart rates and high heart rates had a positive CAC score in data sets acquired in high-pitch spiral (low heart rate: 57.7%, high heart rate: 55.8%) and sequential mode (58.0%, 54.7%, p=n.s.). The median absolute difference in Agatston scores between acquisition modes was 14.2% and 9.2%, for the high and low heart rate groups, respectively. Excellent agreement for risk categorization between the two data acquisition modes was found for the high (kappa=0.927) and low (kappa=0.946) heart rate groups. Radiation dose was 48% lower for high-pitch spiral versus sequential acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Radiation dose for the quantification of coronary calcium can be reduced by 48% when using the high-pitch spiral acquisition mode compared to the sequential mode in participants with a regular high heart rate. CVD risk stratification agreement between the two modes of data acquisition is excellent. Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1190,"Enhancing Cytogenetic Biological Dosimetry Capabilities of the Philippines for Nuclear Incident Preparedness The utility of a biological dosimeter based on the analysis of dicentrics is invaluable in the event of a radiological emergency wherein the estimated absorbed dose of an exposed individual is crucial in the proper medical management of patients. The technique is also used for routine monitoring of occupationally exposed workers to determine radiation exposure. An in vitro irradiation study of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was conducted to establish a dose-response curve for radiation-induced dicentric aberrations. Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2. In this study, the reliability of the dose-response curve in estimating the absorbed dose was also validated for 2 and 4 Gy using OSL dosimeters. The data were fitted into the constructed curve. The result of the validation study showed that the obtained estimate for the absorbed exposure doses was close to the true exposure doses.",Included
937,"The prevalence of cataract in two villages of northern Pakistan with different levels of ultraviolet radiation To study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light on the development of age-related cataract, a community-based cross-sectional study was undertaken in two villages in the mountainous Northern Areas of Pakistan. The relative UV light exposure was calculated by the UK Universities Global Atmospheric Modelling Program using the variables direct sunlight hours per day, latitude and ground reflectivity. A total of 797 subjects (410 men, 387 women) over the age of 40 years from both villages were examined for the presence of cataract. The prevalence of cataract increased with age (p < 0.001) and was significantly higher in women at all ages (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence of cataract between the two villages. The male population in each village was subdivided into those who worked predominantly indoors and those who worked predominantly outdoors. All women worked outdoors. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of cataract between the male outdoor workers in the two villages. The indoor workers in the village with higher UV light exposure (Hunza) had a significantly higher cataract prevalence (p < 0.001) than the indoor workers in the village with lower UV light exposure (Nomol). In the village with lower UV light exposure (Nomol), the male outdoor workers had a significantly higher prevalence of cataract than the male indoor workers (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of cataract between the male indoor and outdoor workers in the village with higher UV light exposure (Hunza). Overall, these results are not strongly supportive of UV light being of major importance in cataractogenesis, but they are consistent with a saturation model of UV light as a risk factor for cataract formation.",Excluded
243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded
1184,"Comparing radiation exposure between ablative therapies for small renal masses PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of radiation exposure patients with small renal masses undergoing percutaneous cyroablation (PCA) or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) received during treatment and follow up., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on all patients with small renal masses <4 cm treated with PCA or PRFA over a 7-year period in a single academic center. Preoperative, operative, and post-operative variables were collected and compared. Radiation exposure received during treatment and 1 year of follow up were also determined for each modality. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS V.17 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U and Pearson Chi-Square tests. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.05., RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pretreatment parameters or oncologic outcomes. The average PCA treatment radiation exposure was 39.7 mSv (15.5-133.4 mSv) compared with 22.2 mSv (8.1-67.7 mSv) for PRFA (p=0.001). During the initial year after treatment, the estimated mean treatment and follow-up radiation exposure for PCA was 134.5 mSv, compared with 117 mSv for RFA when routine computerized tomography imaging was employed., CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first published study that quantifies radiation exposure in PCA and PRFA treatment for small renal masses. These relatively high radiation exposures should be included in the informed consent for these procedures. In addition, caution should be employed when applying these technologies in young patients who are most susceptible to long-term radiation damage.",Excluded

Eggs of wild-type diploid females were fertilized with diploid sperm of a neo-tetraploid male and then cold-shock treated at 3 degreeC (range, +/-0.5 degreeC) for 30 minutes just after fertilization to eliminate the female nucleus. After hatching, ploidy status of the hatched larvae was analyzed by flow cytometry, which revealed putative diploid androgenotes as well as larvae possessing other ploidies. Five independent microsatellite DNA markers were genotyped to confirm all-male inheritance of the resultant diploid larvae. The mean +/- SD yield rate of diploid androgenetic larvae to total eggs used was 12.29 +/- 3.25% in the cold-shock group and 22.23 +/- 13.42% in the UV-irradiated group (P > 0.05).

1191,"Indwelling voice prosthesis insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction Objectives: Total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction is often performed in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. However, postoperative speechlessness significantly decreases patient quality of life. We investigated whether Provox insertion could preserve speech after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Method(s): A total of 130 cases of secondary Provox insertions after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction were analyzed. Communication outcomes were compared using the Head and Neck Cancer Understandability of Speech Subscale. Outcomes and complications associated with insertion site (jejunal insertion vs. esophageal insertion) and adjuvant irradiation therapy were also evaluated. Result(s): Provox insertion had favorable communication outcomes in 102 cases (78.4%). Neither the insertion site nor irradiation affected the communication outcome. Complications were observed in 20 cases (15.4%). Local infection was the most common complication. Free jejunal insertion, in which the resection range was enlarged, had a lower complication rate than did esophageal insertion, and its complication rate was unaffected by previous irradiation. For all patients, the hospitalization duration and duration of speechlessness were 13.4 days and 14.6 months, respectively. Patients receiving jejunal insertions had a significantly shorter hospitalization duration than did those receiving esophageal insertions. Unlike Provox2, ProvoxVega significantly reduced the complication rate to zero. Conclusion(s): For jejunal inserson of a Provox prosthetic, a sufficient margin can be maintained during total pharyngolaryngectomy and irradiation can be performed, and satisfactory communication outcomes were observed. Provox insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction should be considered the standard therapy for voice restoration.

635,"Development and validation of a predictive bone fracture risk model for astronauts There are still many unknowns in the physiological response of human beings to space, but compelling evidence indicates that accelerated bone loss will be a consequence of long-duration spaceflight. Lacking phenomenological data on fracture risk in space, we have developed a predictive tool based on biomechanical and bone loading models at any gravitational level of interest. The tool is a statistical model that forecasts fracture risk, bounds the associated uncertainties, and performs sensitivity analysis. In this paper, we focused on events that represent severe consequences for an exploration mission, specifically that of spinal fracture resulting from a routine task (lifting a heavy object up to 60 kg), or a spinal, femoral or wrist fracture due to an accidental fall or an intentional jump from 1 to 2 m. We validated the biomechanical and bone fracture models against terrestrial studies of ground reaction forces, skeletal loading, fracture risk, and fracture incidence. Finally, we predicted fracture risk associated with reference missions to the moon and Mars that represented crew activities on the surface. Fracture was much more likely on Mars due to compromised bone integrity. No statistically significant gender-dependent differences emerged. Wrist fracture was the most likely type of fracture, followed by spinal and hip fracture.",Excluded
739,"Radioembolization of hepatocarcinoma with 90Y glass microspheres: treatment optimization using the dose-toxicity relationship Aim: Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is, by all standards, a radiation therapy. As such, according to Euratom Directive 2013/59, it should be optimized by a thorough treatment plan based on the distinct evaluation of absorbed dose to the lesions and to the non-tumoural liver (two-compartment dosimetry). Since the dosimetric prediction with 99mTc albumin macro-aggregates (MAA) of non-tumoural liver is much more accurate than the same prediction on lesions, treatment planning should focus on non-tumoural liver rather than on lesion dosimetry. The aim of this study was to determine a safety limit through the analysis of pre-treatment dosimetry with 99mTc-MAA single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT), in order to deliver the maximum tolerable absorbed dose to non-tumoural liver. Method(s): Data from intermediate/advanced hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with 90Y glass microspheres were collected in this single-arm retrospective study. Injection was always lobar, even in case of bilobar disease, to avoid treating the whole liver in a single session. A three-level definition of liver decompensation (LD) was introduced, considering toxicity only in cases of liver decompensation requiring medical action (LD type C, LDC). We report LDC rates, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis between LDC and NO LDC absorbed dose distributions, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) curves and uni- and multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with toxicity. Result(s): A 6-month timeline was defined as necessary to capture all treatment-related toxicity events. Previous transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), presence or extension of portal vein tumoural thrombosis (PVTT) and tumour pattern (nodular versus infiltrative) were not associated with tolerance to TARE. On the contrary, at the multivariate analysis, the absorbed dose averaged over the whole non-tumoural liver (including the non-injected lobe) was a prognostic indicator correlated with liver decompensation (odds ratio = 4.24). Basal bilirubin > 1.1 mg/dL was a second even more significant risk factor (odds ratio = 6.35). NTCP analysis stratified with this bilirubin cut-off determined a 15% liver decompensation risk at 50 Gy/90 Gy for bilirubin >/< 1.1 mg/dL. These results are valid for a 90Y glass microsphere administration 4 days after the reference time. Conclusion(s): Given the low predictive accuracy of 99mTc-MAA on lesion absorbed dose reported by several authors, an optimized TARE with 90Y glass microspheres with lobar injection 4 days after reference time should aim at an absorbed dose averaged over the whole non-tumoural liver of 50 Gy/90 Gy for basal bilirubin higher/lower than 1.1 mg/dL, respectively.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded

The aim of our retrospective chart review was to find out if neodjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery had any effect on the size of primary tumor in patients with PTC. Method(s): In the period 1976-2006, 1,207 patients were treated for PTC at our Institute. The study included 16 patients (13 women, 3 men; mean age 63.5 years) with PTC, who were treated with neoadjuvant ChT from 1988-2005. Poorly differentiated PTC, classical PTC, follicular variant of PTC and Hurthle cell variant of PTC was diagnosed in five cases, five, three and three cases, respectively. A mean tumor diameter was 9.9 cm (range 5-22 cm). Seven patients had pT4 tumor. Regional metastases were detected in ten patients and distant metastases in seven patients. ChT consisted of Vinblastine in eleven cases, Vinblastine with Adriamyin in two cases and other schedules in three cases. Three patients were treated also with preoperative external irradiation. Result(s): Altogether, 40 cycles of ChT were given. After ChT tumor size decreased in all 16 patients: for more than 50% in seven (= 44%) patients and for less than 50% in nine patients. R0, R1 and R2 resection was performed in two, ten and four cases, respectively. Median survival of our patients was 92 (range 11-240) months. Six patients are still alive (median survival 157 months) and two of them have no evidence of disease. Two patients died of causes not related to carcinoma, while eight patients died of PTC (five of distant metastases, one of locoregional disease, two of distant metastases and locoregional disease). Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery may be effective in patients with locally advanced PTC.

The likelyhood of a life threatening medical condition occurring during a mission to Mars has been estimated by NASA to be 1% per year. Since basic life support is a vital skill in critical care medicine, plans must be in place for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in both microgravity and hypogravity (i.e. on the surface of the Moon or Mars). Following the design of a body suspension device to simulate a hypogravity environment, subjects performed external chest compressions in 1G, 0.17G (Lunar), 0.38G (Mars) and 0.7G ('Planet X'). Chest compression adequacy was assessed by means of rate and depth. Heart rate immediately before and after 3 minutes of chest compression gave a measure of rescuer fatigue. Elbow flexion was measured using an electrogoniometer in order to assess the use of arm muscles to achieve chest compressions. This study found that depth (Lunar and Mars) and rate (Mars) of chest compression was below American Heart Association recommendations during hypogravity simulation in the female group. Furthermore, elbow flexion proved to be significantly greater during Lunar and Mars hypogravity simulation than that of the 1G control condition, suggesting that upper arm force may be used to counter the loss of body weight in an attempt to maintain adequate chest compression under these conditions.",Excluded
618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones.

Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included
143,"Telomere stability correlates with longevity of human beings exposed to ionizing radiations Normal somatic cells have a finite number of divisions, a limited capacity to proliferate. Human telomeres contain TTAGGG repeats which are considered a molecular clock marker. The gradual and progressive telomere shortening at each replicative cycle is associated, through the activation of pRB and p53 pathways and genomic instability, to the replicative senescence, a non-dividing state and widespread cell death. There is no information available about telomere status in individuals who live long and have been exposed to ionizing radiations (IR). To determine the telomere stability, we examined telomeres at metaphase, G2-type chromosome aberrations after IR treatment and karyotypic analysis of 15 individuals. Three individuals were above the age of 80 years and 1 among the 3 was estimated to have received more than 10 Gy of occupational exposure about 30 years back. The other 12 were cancer patients that had received more than 50 Gy of gamma-radiation for therapeutic purposes. No telomere instability or defective G2 chromosome repair was found in 3 individuals above the age of 80 years. Whereas, 3 out of 7 prostate and 1 out of 5 breast cancer patients showed higher G2-type chromosome damage as well as a high frequency of telomeric association (also known as chromosome end associations) along with frequent loss of telomeres.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge of neurosurgeons and emergency physicians about ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) and to gain awareness to them about this topic., METHODS: A multiple-choice survey comprising 17 questions was performed to 30 neurosurgeons and 70 emergency room doctors., RESULTS: Emergency medicine doctors, neurosurgeons, emergency medicine residents, neurosurgery residents and general practitioners participated in the survey. Sixty-six percent of participants stated that they examined more than 50 patient with headache, dizziness and head trauma in emergency service per diem and more than half of the participants stated that brain CT was performed in the event of patient's request, even if there was not an indication. 75% of the participants stated that they requested CT scan without neurological examination when the number of patients increased in the emergency room. Eighty-three percent of the participants did not think there was a safe dose limit in CT, 92% did not know the radiation dose received during brain CT, 96% did not know the meaning of the ALARA. Fifty-seven percent of the participants stated that if they informed about the criteria of ALARA, they will take into acount these criteria while requesting CT scan., CONCLUSIONS: In our country, doctors working in emergency services request brain CT needlessly because of taking into account the patient's wish and fear of malpractice. The knowledge of the neurosurgeons and emergency service doctors about ALARA is insufficient. It is necessary to educate our physicians about ALARA protocol, for taking these criteria into their consideration when requesting CT examination. For protecting the patients from the effects of ionizing radiation and reducing the economic loss of hospitals, it is necessary to increase awareness of the ALARA protocol and to increase the number of hospitals which protocol is applied.",Excluded
1068,"Heterogeneity of Necrotic Changes between Cortical and Cancellous Bone in Mandibular Osteoradionecrosis: A Histopathological Analysis of Resection Margin after Segmental Mandibulectomy Background. This study aimed to analyze differences in necrotic changes between cortical and cancellous bone in resection margins after segmental mandibulectomy for advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis. Methods. Anteroposterior bone specimens from eleven patients who underwent segmental mandibulectomy with simultaneous free fibula flap reconstruction for advanced osteoradionecrosis were analyzed histopathologically for the presence of necrotic bone based on the presence of blood vessels within Haversian canals. Results. Ten of eleven (91%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the anterior margins were necrotic. All cancellous bones at the anterior margins were viable. Seven of eleven (64%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the posterior margins were necrotic. Three of eleven (27%) cancellous bones at the posterior margins were necrotic. Conclusion. Necrotic changes are more prevalent in cortices than in cancellous bones in mandibular osteoradionecrosis, probably due to a decrease of periosteal blood supply caused by radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Masaya Akashi et al.",Excluded
10,"[Osteoradionecrosis in adults] Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is not exceptional, despite advances in irradiation techniques. Six cases are reported, involving the pelvis, coxofemoral joint, mandible and vertebrae; in this last case, the semiologic value of the lucent intrasomatic image seen on plain films and tomographies of the vertebrae is underscored. The irradiation dose (above 3 000 rad) is the chief factor in osteoradionecrosis, which may be precipitated by adjuvant factors and potentiating events such as trauma and infection. Pathologic study shows several lesions whose association is suggestive: cell lesions, osteoporosis, vascular lesions, and foci of necrosis. The pathogenic significance of lesions of bone cells is demonstrated, while the part played by vascular lesions is controversial. Involvement of the pelvis and hips following irradiation of pelvic carcinoma is the most common. The scapular girdle and ribs may be involved in irradiation for breast cancer. In involvement of the mandible, remarkable features are its frequency following irradiation of carcinoma of the mouth, the significant part played by potentiating factors, i.e. infection and trauma, severity of complications, i.e. fistulae and hemorrhage, and lastly difficulties of management. Among infrequent sites, involvement of the vertebrae is of interest as it may mimic collapse due to osteoporosis or metastasis. Diagnosis rests on an association of criteria, and fortunately bone biopsy is usually unnecessary. The clinical features, topographical characteristics and course of the disease allow differentiation from bone metastasis; it may be more difficult to distinguish postirradiation sarcoma, which is exceptional, or a number of benign conditions, such as aseptic necrosis, infectious osteoarthritis, and destructive coxarthrosis.",Excluded
1008,"Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of plutonium-induced rat osteosarcomas The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded
1130,"Efficacy of proton pump inhibitors for cellular proliferation and apoptosis in Barrett's oesophagus with different mucin phenotypes Background: Controversy exists concerning the efficacy of acid suppressants in the regression of Barrett's oesophagus. Aim(s): To evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitors on cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cellular proliferation and apoptosis in Barrett's oesophagus with different mucin phenotypes. Method(s): Four hundred and sixty-six biopsy samples of Barrett's oesophagus from 358 non-treatment patients and 81 from 61 chronic proton pump inhibitor users were immunohistochemically examined using anti-cyclooxygenase-2 protein, anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen and anti-single stranded DNA antigens in both mucin phenotypes of Barrett's oesophagus. Result(s): Prevalence of the cyclooxygenase-2 expression pattern did not significantly differ between the non-treatment and proton pump inhibitor users. In those using proton pump inhibitors, significant suppression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen index was found in Barrett's oesophagus with the gastric-predominant mucin phenotype, but not with the intestinal-predominant mucin phenotype. Apoptosis indices in chronic proton pump inhibitor users did not significantly differ between the two mucin phenotypes. Conclusion(s): Proton pump inhibitors suppress cellular proliferation in Barrett's oesophagus with the gastric-predominant mucin phenotype but not in that with the intestinal-predominant mucin phenotype. This finding may at least partly explain the ongoing controversy surrounding the notion that all cases of Barrett's oesophagus respond to acid-suppressive therapy. © 2006 The Authors.",Excluded
706,"Assessment of cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography performance using a scanning linear observer Purpose: Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is widely used to detect myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction. It is important to assess and compare different SPECT system designs in order to achieve the highest detectability of cardiac defects. Method(s): Whitaker 's study [Estimating random signal parameters from noisy images with nuisance parameters: linear and scanning-linear methods,"" Opt. Express 16(11), 8150-8173 (2008)]10.1364/OE.16.008150 on the scanning linear observer (SLO) shows that the SLO can be used to estimate the location and size of signals. One major advantage of the SLO is that it can be used with projection data rather than with reconstruction data. Thus, this observer model assesses the overall hardware performance independent of any reconstruction algorithm. In addition, the computation time of image quality studies is significantly reduced. In this study, three systems based on the design of the GE cadmium zinc telluride-based dedicated cardiac SPECT camera Discovery 530c were assessed. This design, which is officially named the Alcyone Technology: Discovery NM 530c, was commercialized in August, 2009. The three systems, GE27, GE19, and GE13, contain 27, 19, and 13 detectors, respectively. Clinically, a human heart can be virtually segmented into three coronary artery territories: the left-anterior descending artery, left-circumflex artery, and right coronary artery. One of the most important functions of a cardiac SPECT system is to produce images from which a radiologist can accurately predict in which territory the defect exists [http://www.asnc.org/media/PDFs/PPReporting081511.pdf, Guideline from American Society of Nuclear Cardiology]. A good estimation of the extent of the defect from the projection images is also very helpful for determining the seriousness of the myocardial ischemia. In this study, both the location and extent of defects were estimated by the SLO, and the system performance was assessed by localization receiver operating characteristic (LROC) [P. Khurd and G. Gindi, ""Decision strategies maximizing the area under the LROC curve,"" Proc. SPIE 5749, 150-161 (2005)]10.1117/12.595915 or estimation receiver operating characteristic (EROC) [E. Clarkson, ""Estimation receiver operating characteristic curve and ideal observers for combined detection/estimation tasks,"" J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 24, B91-B98 (2007)]10.1364/JOSAA.24.000B91 curves. Result(s): The area under the LROC/EROC curve (AULC/AUEC) and the true positive fraction (TPF) at a specific false positive fraction (FPF) can be treated as the figures of merit. For radii estimation with a 1 mm tolerance, the AUEC values of the GE27, GE19, and GE13 systems are 0.8545, 0.8488, and 0.8329, and the TPF at FPF = 5% are 77.1%, 76.46%, and 73.55%, respectively. The assessment of all three systems revealed that the GE19 system yields estimated information and cardiac defect detectability very close to those of the GE27 system while using eight fewer detectors. Thus, 30% of the expensive detector units can be removed with confidence. Conclusion(s): As the results show, a combination of the SLO and LROC/EROC curves can determine the configuration that yields the most relevant estimation/detection information. Thus, this is a useful method for assessing cardiac SPECT systems. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.""",Excluded
137,"Is There a Role for Radiotherapy in the Primary Management of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma? A Single-centre Case Series Aims: In recent years, the optimum primary management of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has evolved from combined modality chemoradiotherapy to chemotherapy alone. We describe a single-centre case series of PCNSL with a view to assessing the role of radiotherapy in primary disease management. Material(s) and Method(s): West of Scotland PCNSL cases between 2001 and 2010 were identified by neuropathology. Observational data were collected retrospectively from case notes and electronic systems. Result(s): Forty-nine patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The median age was 61 years. Chemotherapy with a view to consolidation radiotherapy on completion was delivered to 61% (. n=30). Regimens varied, but were generally methotrexate-based. Chemotherapy was discontinued prematurely in 80% (. n=24) due to progressive disease (. n=12), intolerable toxicity (. n=7) or death (. n=4). In all patients who progressed or did not tolerate chemotherapy, treatment was changed to immediate salvage radiotherapy; modal irradiation was 40Gy. Radiotherapy alone was delivered to those not suitable for chemotherapy (18%, n=9) and best supportive care to those with poor performance status (18%, n=9). The overall median survival was 8 months. In those receiving single modality radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the median survival was 5 and 8 months, respectively. For those completing chemoradiotherapy in its entirety, 3 year survival was 100%; in groups receiving salvage radiotherapy despite progressive disease or chemotherapy toxicity, moderate survival was maintained with immediate radiotherapy with 3 year survival rates of 33 and 60%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Although chemotherapy alone remains the optimal treatment of PCNSL, out with clinical trials only a minority of patients complete chemotherapy due to toxicity and disease progression; in such patients, immediate salvage radiotherapy provides an effective and safe alternative with maintenance of good outcomes. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded
395,"Simulation of Tracer Dose Reduction in 18F-FDG PET/MRI: Effects on Oncologic Reading, Image Quality, and Artifacts The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of stepwise-reduced doses on objective and subjective image parameters and on oncologic readings in whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI. Methods: We retrospectively simulated the stepwise reduction of 18F-FDG doses of 19 patients (mean age +/- SD, 50.9 +/- 11.7 y; mean body mass index +/- SD, 22.8 +/- 3.2 kg/m2) who received a whole-body PET/MRI examination from 3 to 0.5 MBq/kg of body weight (kgBW) in intervals of 0.25. Objective imaging parameters were assessed by measuring the SUV and coefficient of variation in different regions (aorta, liver, spleen, kidney, small bowel, lumbar vertebra, psoas muscle, urinary bladder) as well as the noise-equivalent counting rates in each bed position. Subjective image quality was evaluated with a masked reading of each simulated PET compared with the dose of 2 MBq/kgBW. Oncologic reading was performed first according to PERCIST in each dose and second by defining malignant lesions in doses of 2 MBq/kgBW and the maximum dose image (gold standard). The diagnostic confidence of each lesion was measured using a Likert scale. Results: With decreasing doses, regions in the mid abdomen showed a stronger decrease of SUVmean and noise-equivalent counting rates than regions in the upper abdomen (SUVmean, -45% and -15% on average in the small bowel and the liver, respectively). The coefficient of variation showed a nonlinear increase, pronounced below 1.5 MBq/kgBW. Subjective image quality was stable over a range between 1.25 and 2.75 MBq/kgBW compared with 2 MBq/kgBW. However, large photopenic areas in the mid abdomen were observed in 2 patients. In the PERCIST reading, target lesions were above the liver threshold with a stable SUVpeak in all cases down to 2 MBq/kgBW. Eighty-six of 90 lesions were identified correctly with a dose of 2 MBq/kgBW; Likert scores did not differ significantly. Conclusion: A reduction of doses in 18F-FDG PET/MRI might be possible down to 2 MBq/kgBW in oncologic whole-body examinations. The image quality in the mid abdomen seems to be more affected by lower doses than in the upper abdomen, and in single cases large photopenic areas can occur. Therefore, we do not recommend reducing doses below 3 MBq/kgBW in adults at this time. Copyright © 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
895,"Manganese-52 positron emission tomography tracer characterization and initial results in phantoms and in vivo Purpose: Manganese(II) is employed as a contrast agent with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for study of neuronal activation in rats and mice. However, at the concentrations required for MRI, Mn may induce pharmacological or toxic effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of 52MnCl2 at tracer doses has the potential to allow similar Mn studies as manganese-enhanced MRI while providing quantitative results and avoiding toxic effects. In this work, 52MnCl2 is produced and characterized as a PET tracer in phantoms and in rats. Method(s): 52MnCl2 was produced by proton irradiation of natural Cr foil and separated by column chromatography. Images were acquired on a Siemens Focus 120 small animal PET scanner. Phantom images were acquired to assess uniformity, resolution, cascade background correction, and count rate linearity. Images of rats were also acquired after systemic and intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of 52MnCl2 to investigate Mn(II) distribution in vivo. Result(s): Irradiation yield was 74.6 +/- 8.5 kBqmuA min 52Mn at end of bombardment with initial specific activity of at least 3.5 MBqnmol. 52Mn PET images show similar uniformity and resolution to 18F. 18F based detector efficiency normalization is adequate for 52Mn imaging. Subtraction of a rescaled random events distribution from sinogram data is effective for cascade correction of 52Mn PET data. After systemic injection, 52Mn appears in structures throughout the body of rats, including bones, liver, intestines, and the pituitary gland, but does not appear detectably throughout the brain. After ICV injection, 52Mn remains in the brain and spinal cord. Conclusion(s): 52Mn is a promising tracer for small animal PET imaging, yielding image quality comparable to 18F. Potential applications include studies similar to Mn-enhanced neuronal MRI, and in other organ systems including bones, spinal cord, and the digestive tract. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
626,"Dose-dependent changes in renal (1)H-/(23)Na MRI after adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric cancer PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined., RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment., CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.""",Excluded

294,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82).

Concomitant Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin followed by 3 cycles of adjuvant Cisplatin based chemotherapy is the standard of care in patients with locally advanced disease (LANPC). However, the compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy has been unsatisfactory. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2002 and July 2010, fifty-four patients (37 males: 17 females) with locally advanced (AJCC Stage III & IV), non-metastatic NPC were treated using Induction Chemotherapy (IC) with Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) for 3 cycles, followed by Concomitant chemo-radiation using weekly Carboplatin with conventionally fractionated 3-D conformal radiotherapy to a total dose of 65-70 Gy. Result(s): Median age was 42 year (15 to 72). Twenty-six patients (48%) had stage IV disease, and 17 (31%) had T4 tumours. Undifferentiated Carcinoma Nasopharyngeal Type accounted for 96% of the cases. Fortysix patients had more than 12 months follow-up (median 42) and are the subject of the following analysis. Two patients died during induction chemotherapy. Of the remaining 44 patients, IC resulted in 25% Complete Clinical Remission, and 72% Partial Remission, an overall Response Rate of 97%. Hematological toxicity was frequent, but manageable. In total, there were 2 local and 2 distant relapses, 2 of them appearing beyond 3-years of follow-up. Two patients died of progressive disease, one is alive with disease, and one local relapse was successfully salvaged with further radiotherapy. For the entire series (46 patients) the 4-year Kaplan-Meier Overall Survival (OS) rate is 88%. For the 44 patients who completed the protocol, the 4-year Disease Free Survival (DFS) rate is 84%. All 8 patients under 23 year of age remain disease-free at more than 6 years median follow-up. One patient developed a suspected grade 3 neurologic toxicity, and another had a cerebral-vascular accident one year following salvage local re-irradiation. Conclusion(s): Sequential therapy as used in this group of patients seems well tolerated and yields high remission rate and an encouraging DFS and OS in patients with LANPC. Future development should focus on better risk stratification, and systematic use of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapylike techniques. Young adults with LANPC may need a different treatment approach that would include IC followed by response-adjusted chemoradiotherapy.",Excluded
535,"The value of clinical prognostic factors for survival in patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of clinical prognostic factors for survival of patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Material and methods. A total of 115 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer were analyzed. Twenty-three patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer (pT2-T4) were treated according to the protocol of a prospective clinical study. In all the cases, transurethral resection was followed by radiation and chemotherapy. A total dose of 54-60 Gy of radiotherapy was delivered by daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy each. Simultaneous chemotherapy was started on the same day as radiotherapy; gemcitabine at a dose of 175-300 mg/m2 was delivered once a week intravenously for 6 weeks. Individual patient data was analyzed in a retrospective part of the study. Radical cystectomy was performed to 46 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer, and radiotherapy was delivered to 46 patients. Inclusion criteria for patients into a prospective or retrospective trial were equal. We evaluated a prognostic value of various clinical factors for patients treated with radical cystectomy, chemoradiation with gemcitabine, and radiation alone. Results. The 3-year overall survival in the cystectomy group was 51.1%, in the chemoradiation group 38.0%, and in the radiotherapy group 26.9% (P=0.001). In univariate analysis in the chemoradiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival (P=0.03). In the radiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival too (P=0.01). In the radical cystectomy group, an important factor was a complete or incomplete TUR (P=0.02).

Methods and Materials: Between May 2001 and December 2006, 487 patients with T3 mid or distal rectal cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Concurrent CRT was administered preoperatively (n = 364, 74.7%) or postoperatively (n = 123, 25.3%). The radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. All patients underwent a total mesorectal excision and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in DFS, stratified by ypStage and pStage, were compared using the log-rank test. Result(s): For surviving patients, the median follow-up period was 68 months (range, 12-105 months). The 5-year local recurrence-free survival rate was not different, at 95.3% and 92.1% in preoperative and postoperative CRT groups, respectively (p = 0.402), but the 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate was significantly different, at 81.6% (preoperative CRT) vs. 65.4% (postoperative CRT; p = 0.001). The 5-year DFS rate of 78.8% in the preoperative CRT group was significantly better than the 63.0% rate in the postoperative CRT group (p = 0.002). Post-CRT pathologic Stage 0-I occurred in 42.6% (155 of 364) of the patients with preoperative CRT. The 5-year DFS rates were 90.2% (ypStage 0-I), 83.5% (ypStage II), 77.3% (pStage II), 58.6% (ypStage III), and 54.7% (pStage III). The DFS rate of ypStage 0-I was significantly better than that of ypStage II or pStage II. Post-CRT pathologic Stage II and III had similar DFS, compared with pStage II and III, respectively. Conclusion(s): Disease-free survival predicted by each ypStage was similar to that predicted by the respective pStage. Improved DFS with preoperative vs. postoperative CRT was associated with the ypStage 0-I group that showed a similarly favorable outcome to pStage I rectal cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Patient's data who received implants in the mandible were selected to be evaluated regarding implant success and contributing factors. Implant survival was calcula ted by the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Stat-View Version 4.1, Abacus Concepts, Inc.) and Cox models were used to evaluate any association between implant failure and reconstructive or medical treatment modality. Result(s): A total of 136 implants were placed in 33 patients during December 2006 to April 2012. Ten of the subjects were females and 23 were males with a mean age of 65 years. 21 patients received radiotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose between 56 Gray and 76 Gray. In six patients failures were noted resulting in a loss of 17 implants. Cumulative survival rates were 92.7% after 1 year and 87.5% after years two and three. Radiation therapy contributed to 12 of the 17 implant failures (p-value < 0.3). Failures occurred more in the interforam inal than in the posterior region (11-6). Free vascularized bone grafts with two failure fared significantly better than own bone or free bone grafts (p-value < 0.344). Conclusion(s): Astra Tech implant survival is acceptably high in this at risk group of patients and compares more than favorably with comparative studies in the literature. Radiation therapy seems to be associated with implant failure and the contribution of vascular-ized tissue to the survival of implants seems to be significant.",Excluded
350,"Translocation analysis by the FISH-painting method for retrospective dose reconstruction in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation 10 years after exposure Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful method largely used for detecting chromosomal rearrangements, translocations in particular, which are important biomarkers for dose assessment in case of human exposure to ionizing radiation. To test the possibility of using the translocation analysis by FISH-painting method in retrospective dose assessment, we carried out in vitro experiments in irradiated human lymphocytes, in parallel with the analysis of translocations in lymphocytes from 10 individuals, who were exposed to 137cesium in the Goiania (Brazil) accident (samples collected 10 years after exposure). The in vitro dose-response curve for the genomic translocation frequencies (FGs) fits a linear quadratic model, according to the equation: Y=0.0243X2+0.0556X. The FG values were also calculated for the individuals exposed to 137cesium, ranging from 0.58 to 5.91 per 100 cells, and the doses were estimated and compared with the results obtained by dicentric analysis soon after the accident, taking the opportunity to test the validity of translocation analysis in retrospective biodosimetry. A tentative of retrospective dosimetry was performed, indicating that the method is feasible only for low level exposure (below 0.5Gy), while for higher doses there is a need to apply appropriate correction factors, which take into consideration mainly the persistence of chromosomal translocations along with time, and the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors determining the inter-individual variability in the cellular responses to radiation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

70,"Symptomatic cervical vertebral hemangioma treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty Background: Vertebral hemangioma (VH) is considered to be a benign lesion of bone with a rich vasculature. Most incidentally discovered hemangiomas are asymptomatic. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of symptomatic thoracic and lumbar VHs. To our knowledge, the reports concerning PVP on symptomatic cervical VHs are quite rare. Objective(s): Our intent was to assess PVP as treatment for symptomatic cervical hemangiomas. Study Design: Prospective evaluation. Setting(s): An inteventional pain management practice, single medical center. Method(s): Eight patients with symptomatic cervical VHs were enrolled between December 2008 and February 2012, all of whom underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine. The patients with 8 vertebral bodies of VHs were treated by using PVP. The clinical and radiological data were collected and analyzed. Postoperative outcomes were determined using a visual analog scale. Result(s): Surgical levels include C3 (2 patients), C4 (3 patients), C5 (2 patients), and C6 (one patient). The average follow-up period was 27.4 months, with a minimum of 12 months. Mean operative time and x-ray exposure time were respectively 35 +/- 7.1 minutes and 25 +/- 7.7 seconds. The visual analogue scale for neck pain decreased significantly from 6.9 +/- 0.6 preoperatively to 1.3 +/- 0.5 (P < 0.01) on the second day after surgery, with a final score of 1.2 +/- 0.5 (P < 0.01). Cement distribution was always diffuse and homogeneous. No cement leakage was observed in all cases except for 2 patients. There were no other major complications at the time of last follow-up evaluation. Limitation(s): An observational clinical trial with a relatively small sample size. Conclusion(s): Short-term results indicate that PVP appears to be an effective and safe treatment for symptomatic cervical VHs.",Excluded
943,"State-of-the-art MR Imaging for Thoracic Diseases Since thoracic MR imaging was first used in a clinical setting, it has been suggested that MR imaging has limited clinical utility for thoracic diseases, especially lung diseases, in comparison with x-ray CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. However, in many countries and states and for specific indications, MR imaging has recently become practicable. In addition, recently developed pulmonary MR imaging with ultra-short TE (UTE) and zero TE (ZTE) has enhanced the utility of MR imaging for thoracic diseases in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, MR imaging has been introduced as being capable of assessing pulmonary function. It should be borne in mind, however, that these applications have so far been academically and clinically used only for healthy volunteers, but not for patients with various pulmonary diseases in Japan or other countries. In 2020, the Fleischner Society published a new report, which provides consensus expert opinions regarding appropriate clinical indications of pulmonary MR imaging for not only oncologic but also pulmonary diseases. This review article presents a brief history of MR imaging for thoracic diseases regarding its technical aspects and major clinical indications in Japan 1) in terms of what is currently available, 2) promising but requiring further validation or evaluation, and 3) developments warranting research investigations in preclinical or patient studies. State-of-the-art MR imaging can non-invasively visualize lung structural and functional abnormalities without ionizing radiation and thus provide an alternative to CT. MR imaging is considered as a tool for providing unique information. Moreover, prospective, randomized, and multi-center trials should be conducted to directly compare MR imaging with conventional methods to determine whether the former has equal or superior clinical relevance. The results of these trials together with continued improvements are expected to update or modify recommendations for the use of MRI in near future.",Excluded
450,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem. V30 may be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism when determining an individual patient's treatment. © 2014 Akgun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1152,"Effect of low-level laser therapy (GaAlAs) on bone regeneration in midpalatal anterior suture after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of laser therapy on bone regeneration in the midpalatal anterior suture (MPAS) after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME). Method(s): Thirteen patients aged between 18 and 33 years old with maxillary transverse deficiency (>=7.0 mm) were evaluated. All patients underwent subtotal Le Fort I osteotomy with separation of the pterygomaxillary suture with the use of Hyrax expander, and were divided into 2 groups: control group (n = 6) and laser group (n = 7). A GaAlAs laser (P = 100 mW, lambda = 830 nm, O = 0.06 cm2) was used. The laser was applied in 8 treatment sessions with intervals of 48 hours. Each treatment session consisted of laser applications, per point (E = 8.4J, ED = 140J/cm2), at 3 points on the MPAS, and total dose of E = 25.2 J, ED = 420 J/cm2. Digital radiographs were taken before the surgical procedure and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 7-month follow-up visits. Optical density analysis of the regenerated bone was performed using Adobe Photoshop 8.0 software. Result(s): Bone regeneration associated with the use of laser after SARME showed a statistically significant difference. A higher mineralization rate was found in the laser group (26.3%, P < .001) than the control group. Conclusion(s): Low-level laser irradiation (GaAlAs) accelerates bone regeneration in MPAS after SARME. However, the optical density measurements after 7 months of follow-up were lower in comparison with the preoperative measurements. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
568,"Endoscopic lateral approach thyroid lobectomy: safe evolution from endoscopic parathyroidectomy INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic thyroid surgery has been shown to be feasible. Most minimal access procedures have been performed via a midline approach. Based on our experience of more than 500 endoscopic parathyroidectomies via a lateral approach we have used the same method for thyroid lobectomy., METHODS: We present our experience of endoscopic thyroid lobectomy via a lateral approach (ETLA) and review of the results over a 1-year period (2004). Inclusion criteria for ETLA were (1) solitary nodule with atypical/suspicious fine-needle biopsy (FNB) or solitary toxic nodule; (2) lesions with a diameter of < 3 cm. Patients with a history of previous neck surgery or radiation exposure were excluded. All patients underwent postoperative vocal cord checks and plasma calcium evaluation., RESULTS: A total of 742 thyroid procedures were performed during 2004. Among them, 38 patients (5.1%) underwent ETLA. Indications for surgery were suspicious FNB results (36 patients) and a toxic nodule (2 patients). Mean nodule size was 19.2 mm. Mean +/- SD operating time was 102 +/- 27 minutes. All recurrent laryngeal nerves were identified (including one that was nonrecurrent). Of the 38 patients, the superior parathyroid gland was identified in 36 and the inferior parathyroid gland in 33. There were two conversions due to difficulty with the dissection. Two operations were converted because malignancy was diagnosed on frozen section examination. Two patients underwent a delayed completion thyroidectomy when definitive histology necessitated it. There were no permanent operative complications, and all patients were discharged on the first postoperative day., CONCLUSIONS: ETLA offers excellent intraoperative visualization of the vital structures and is a safe alternative to conventional thyroid lobectomy in selected cases.",Excluded
721,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are sex specific Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads. These data constitute the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced bystander effects in mouse spleen in vivo. We show the role of sex hormones in spleen bystander responses and discuss implications of the observed changes.",Included

An increased chromosomal instability observed in the first laboratory generation of nonirradiated common voles was caused by reversible modifications in the expression of mutator genes inherited from parents exposed to alpha-irradiation rather than by classic mutations occurred in specific loci.",Included
607,"Defeating Unconscious Bias: The Role of a Structured, Reflective, and Interactive Workshop Background: Unconscious or implicit biases are universal and detrimental to health care and the learning environment but can be corrected. Historical interventions used the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which may have limitations. Objective(s): We determined the efficacy of an implicit bias training without using the IAT. Method(s): From April 2019 to June 2020, a 90-minute educational workshop was attended by students, residents, and faculty. The curriculum included an interactive unconscious biases presentation, videoclips using vignettes to demonstrate workplace impact of unconscious biases with strategies to counter, and reflective group discussions. The evaluation included pre- and postintervention surveys. Participants were shown images of 5 individuals and recorded first impressions regarding trustworthiness and presumed profession to unmask implicit bias. Result(s): Of approximately 273 participants, 181 were given the survey, of which 103 (57%) completed it with significant increases from pre- to postintervention assessments for perception scores (28.87 [SEM 0.585] vs 32.73 [0.576], P < .001) and knowledge scores (5.68 [0.191] vs 7.22 [0.157], P < .001). For a White male physician covered in tattoos, only 2% correctly identified him as a physician, and 60% felt he was untrustworthy. For a smiling Black female astronaut, only 13% correctly identified her as an astronaut. For a brooding White male serial killer, 50% found him trustworthy. Conclusion(s): An interactive unconscious bias workshop, performed without the use of an IAT, was associated with increases in perceptions and knowledge regarding implicit biases.

1147,"Emotional intelligence may influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy in patients with hypertension Objective: The aim of study was to definite if the emotional intelligence (EI) of patients with arterial hypertension (AH) can influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy. Design and method: We assessed 70 ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data of AH patients. ABPM monitor (Spacelabs 90207) was applied after the washout period. We defined daytime period as 8.00-22.00, nighttime - 0.00-6.00, and work period as 11.00-19.00. After ABPM session patients completed the emotional intelligence questionnaire (EmIn) by Lyusin D. We analyzed following EmIn scale scores: I emotion self-awareness; II management of one's own emotions; III control of emotional expression; IV understanding others' emotions; V management of others' emotions. The patients were randomized to treatment antihypertensive drugs. Then the patients were randomized to the control and intervention groups. In the control group patients were given standard recommendations for cardiovascular disease patients. In the intervention group patients were given standard recommendations and advice on lifestyle change according to the results of the EmIn questionnaire. The patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs in average therapeutic doses for 3 weeks (amlodipine, metoprolol, enalapril, telmisartan). In the absence of the therapy effectiveness, the patients began to treatment with the combined therapy, but these data were not included in the analysis. At the end of the three-week therapy was performed EmIn test and ABPM. Result(s): The mean daytime BP was (M +/- SD): systolic (SBP) - 142.1 +/- 14.5; diastolic (DBP) - 90.1 +/- 10.9 mm Hg. In each group there were 35 patients who were comparable in baseline BP, sex, age, EmIn characteristics, body mass index and drugs doses. We found that treatment with average therapeutic doses of antihypertensive drugs is not effective (table 1) in the control group. However, in the intervention group, the same doses of the drug leads to the significant BP reduction of workplace and daytime BP levels. Night BP indices in this patients did not significantly decreased (table 2). Conclusion(s): Thus, lifestyle changes, not only in according to conventional recommendations for cardiovascular patients, but also with regard of test results of emotional intelligence can enhance the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy.",Excluded
328,"Comparison between slope-intercept and slope-only techniques for measuring glomerular filtration rate: use of two independent markers and an independent arbiter PURPOSE: Exclusive use of the half-time of clearance of a filtration marker in the bolus injection, single compartment technique for measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a convenient approach that gives GFR (GFR(SO)) already scaled for extracellular fluid volume (ECV). It has been criticized as less accurate than the conventional, slope-intercept technique (GFR(SI)). The aim of the study was to compare the respective levels of agreement of GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) with GFR based on plasma creatinine (eGFR) used as an independent arbiter., METHODS: GFR was measured with both 51Cr-EDTA and iohexol, simultaneously injected into opposite arms. Plasma obtained bilaterally 20, 40, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min after injection was assayed for marker injected contra-laterally, 51Cr-EDTA by well-counting and iohexol by X-ray fluorescence. ECV and GFR, scaled to body surface area (BSA), were formally measured from six samples and GFR(SI) (scaled to BSA) and GFR(SO) from the last three., RESULTS: Disagreement between GFR(SO) measured with 51Cr-EDTA and eGFR was not significantly higher than the corresponding disagreement between eGFR and GFR(SI). Disagreement between GFR(SO) measured with iohexol and eGFR was significantly higher than between eGFR and GFR(SI). GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) correlated more closely when measured with 51Cr-EDTA than with iohexol. Individual differences between GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) using one marker correlated significantly with ECV measured with the other., CONCLUSIONS: GFR(SO) is critically dependent on the accuracy of half-time measurement and, measured with iohexol, appeared less reliable than GFR(SI). GFR(SI) and GFR(SO) measured with 51Cr-EDTA, however, have similar levels of reliability.",Excluded

Clinical improvement was quantified by self-evaluation on a visual analogic scale (SVAS) before HBI, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours, at 7 days, and at each monthly control until patient's death. Univariate analysis included: sex, Karnofsky's index, tumor origin, histology, HBI dose, and SVAS before treatment. For statistical purposes the significance level was 0.05., RESULTS: Complete (37.5%) or partial responses were observed in 72/78 (92.3%) procedures, 80% appearing during the first 72 hours. Difference between mean SVAS, before and after treatment (7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 2.8 +/- 2.5), was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A mean response duration of 101 days over a mean overall survival of 141 days implies the 70% of expected patient's life span.

874,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for glioblastoma: Retrospective analysis Purpose: This retrospective study was done to better understand the conditions for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for glioblastoma may be efficacious. Method(s): Between 2000 and 2007, 33 patients with a pathological diagnosis of glioblastoma received SRS with the Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system. Eighteen patients (54%) underwent salvage SRS for recurrence while 15 (45%) patients received upfront SRS following standard fractionated RT for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Result(s): There were no RTOG grade >2 acute side effects. The median survival after SRS was 6.7 months (range 1.4-74.7). There was no significant difference in overall survival (from the time of initial diagnosis) with respect to the timing of SRS (p = 0.2). There was significantly better progression free survival in patients treated with SRS as consolidation versus at the time of recurrence (p = 0.04). The majority of patients failed within or at the margin of the SRS treatment volume (21/26 evaluable for recurrence). Conclusion(s): SRS is well tolerated in the treatment of glioblastoma. As there was no difference in survival whether SRS is delivered upfront or at recurrence, the treatment for each patient should be individualized. Future studies are needed to identify patients most likely to respond to SRS. © 2009 Biswas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
248,"Synchrotron radiation micro-CT at the micrometer scale for the analysis of the three-dimensional morphology of microcracks in human trabecular bone Bone quality is an important concept to explain bone fragility in addition to bone mass. Among bone quality factors, microdamage which appears in daily life is thought to have a marked impact on bone strength and plays a major role in the repair process. The starting point for all studies designed to further our understanding of how bone microdamage initiate or dissipate energy, or to investigate the impact of age, gender or disease, remains reliable observation and measurement of microdamage. In this study, 3D Synchrotron Radiation (SR) micro-CT at the micrometric scale was coupled to image analysis for the three-dimensional characterization of bone microdamage in human trabecular bone specimens taken from femoral heads. Specimens were imaged by 3D SR micro-CT with a voxel size of 1.4 µm. A new tailored 3D image analysis technique was developed to segment and quantify microcracks. Microcracks from human trabecular bone were observed in different tomographic sections as well as from 3D renderings. New 3D quantitative measurements on the microcrack density and morphology are reported on five specimens. The 3D microcrack density was found between 3.1 and 9.4/mm3 corresponding to a 2D density between 0.55 and 0.76 /mm2. The microcrack length and width measured in 3D on five selected microcrack ranged respectively from 164 µm to 209 µm and 100 µm to 120 µm. This is the first time that various microcracks in unloaded human trabecular bone--from the simplest linear crack to more complex cross-hatch cracks--have been examined and quantified by 3D imaging at this scale. The suspected complex morphology of microcracks is here considerably more evident than in the 2D observations. In conclusion, this technique opens new perspective for the 3D investigation of microcracks and the impact of age, disease or treatment.",Excluded
935,"Effect of Hypercapnia, an Element of Obstructive Respiratory Disorders, on Pancreatic Cancer Chemoresistance and Progression BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive respiratory disorders (ORD) are linked to increased rates of cancer related deaths. Little is known about the effects of hypercapnia (elevated CO2) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development and drug-resistance.
STUDY DESIGN: Two PDAC cell-lines were exposed to normocapnic (5% CO2) and hypercapnic (continuous/intermittent 10% CO2) conditions, physiologically similar to patients with active ORD. Cells were assessed for proliferation rate, colony formation, and chemo/radiotherapeutic efficacy. In a retrospective clinical study design, patients with PDAC who have undergone pancreatic resection between the years of 2002-2014 were reviewed. Active smokers were excluded in order to remove possible smoking-related pro-tumorigenic influences. Clinical data, pathological findings, and survival endpoints were recorded. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Exposure to hypercapnia resulted in an increased colony formation and proliferation rate, in-vitro in both cell lines (MIA-PaCa-2:111% increase and Panc-1:114% increase, P<0.05). Hypercapnia exposure induced a 2.5-fold increase in oxaliplatin resistance (P<0.05) in both cell lines and increased resistance to ionizing radiation in MIA-PaCa-2 cells (P<0.05). Five hundred and seventy-eight patients were included [52% males, median age was 68.7 years (IQR 60.6-76.8 years)]. Cox regression analysis, assessing TNM-staging, age, gender and ORD status, identified ORD as an independent risk factor for both overall survival (HR 1.64, 95%CI 1.2-2.3, P<0.05) and disease-free survival (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.06-2.67).
CONCLUSIONS: PDAC cells exposed to hypercapnic environments, common to patients with ORD, showed tumor proliferation, radioresistance and chemoresistance. Patients with a history of ORD had a worse overall prognosis, suggesting that hypercapnic conditions play a role in the development and progression of PDAC and stressing the need for patient-tailored care.",Excluded

1037,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded
672,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded
1050,"Surgeon volume and adequacy of thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer Introduction. We aimed to determine influence of surgeon volume on (1) frequency of appropriate initial surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and (2) completeness of resection. Methods. We reviewed all initial thyroidectomies (Tx; lobectomy and total) performed in a health system during 2011; surgeons were grouped by number of Tx cases per year. For patients with histologic DTC >=1 cm, surgeon volume was correlated with initial extent of the operation, and markers of complete resection including uptake on I123 prescan, thyrotropin-stimulated thyroglobulin levels, and I131 dose administered. Results. Of 1,249 patients who underwent Tx by 42 surgeons, 29% had DTC >=1 cm without distant metastasis. At a threshold of >=30 Tx per year, surgeons were more likely to perform initial total Tx for DTC >=1 cm (P = .01), and initial resection was more complete as measured by all 3 quantitative markers. For patients with advanced stage disease, a threshold of >=50 Tx per year was needed before observing improvements in I123 uptake (P = .004). Conclusion. Surgeons who perform >=30 Tx a year are more likely to undertake the appropriate initial operation and have more complete initial resection for DTC patients. Surgeon volume is an essential consideration in optimizing outcomes for DTC patients, and even higher thresholds (>=50 Tx/year) may be necessary for patients with advanced disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
886,"Dependency of the interaural phase difference sensitivities of inferior collicular neurons on a preceding tone and its implications in neural population coding This study examined the sensitivities of the neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus (IC) to the interaural phase difference (IPD) of a preceding tone, and explored its implications in the neural-population representation of the IPD. Single-unit responses were recorded from the IC of anesthetized gerbils. The stimulus was a dichotic tone sequence with a common frequency (typically the unit's best frequency) and level (10-20 dB relative to the threshold), consisting of a conditioner (200 ms) followed by a probe (50 ms) with a silent gap (5-100 ms) between them. The IPDs of the 2 tones were varied independently. The presence of a conditioner generally suppressed the probe-driven responses; the effect size increased as the conditioner IPD approached the unit's most responsive IPD. The units' preferred IPDs were relatively invariant with the conditioner IPD. Two types of models were used to evaluate the effects of a conditioner on the IPD representation at the level of IC neural population. One was a version of the population-vector model. The other was the hemispheric-channel model, which assumed that the stimulus IPD is represented by the activities of 2 broadly tuned hemispheric channels. Both models predicted that, in the presence of a conditioner, the IPD representation would shift in a direction away from the conditioner IPD. This appears to emphasize the difference between the conditioner and the probe IPDs. The results indicate that in the IC, neural processes for IPD adapt to the stimulus history to enhance the representational contrast between successive sounds.",Excluded
1198,"Thoracic radiotherapy with or without daily low-dose carboplatin in elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: A randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301) Background: It is unknown whether combined chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival in elderly patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to assess whether radiotherapy plus carboplatin results in longer survival than radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with NSCLC. Method(s): This was a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301). Patients older than 70 years with unresectable stage III NSCLC were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy plus concurrent low-dose carboplatin [30 mg/m2 per day, 5 days a week for 20 days]) or radiotherapy alone, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), stage (IIIA vs IIIB), and institution. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was analysed for the eligible population and stratified by ECOG performance status, stage, and institution. The trial was stopped early as a result of the second planned interim analysis. This study is registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000060, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00132665. Finding(s): 200 patients were enrolled from Sept 1, 2003 to May 27, 2010: 100 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 100 in the radiotherapy group. The second planned interim analysis was done 10 months after completion of patient accrual. At this time, median follow-up for censored cases was 19.4 months (IQR 10.3-33.5). In accordance with the prespecified stopping rule, the JCOG data and safety monitoring committee recommended early publication of this trial because the difference in overall survival favoured the chemoradiotherapy group. Median overall survival for the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone groups were 22.4 months (95% CI 16.5-33.6) and 16.9 months (13.4-20.3), respectively (hazard ratio 0.68, 95.4% CI 0.47-0.98, stratified log-rank test one-sided p value=0.0179). More patients had grade 3-4 haematological toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy alone group, including leucopenia (61 [63.5%] vs none), neutropenia (55 [57.3%] vs none), and thrombocytopenia (28 [29.2%] vs two [2.0%]). Grade 3 infection was more common with chemoradiotherapy (12 patients [12.5%]) than with radiotherapy (four patients [4.1%]). Incidences of grade 3-4 pneumonitis and late lung toxicity were similar between groups. There were seven treatment-related deaths: three of 100 patients (3.0%) in the chemoradiotherapy group and four of 100 (4.0%) in the radiotherapy group. Interpretation(s): For a select group of elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC, combination chemoradiotherapy provides a clinically significant benefit over radiotherapy alone, and should be considered for this population.

67,"Toward personalized dose-prescription in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Validation of published normal tissue complication probability models PURPOSE: To identify published normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models suitable for patient-specific dose-prescription in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) through in-house validation., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From eight previously published candidate NTCP models (>=grade 2 acute esophagitis and radiation pneumonitis; AE2, RP2), patient-specific dose-responses were calculated using model variables and fractionation-corrected doses for 241 LA-NSCLC patients treated with chemo-IMRT to 50-80Gy@1.8-2.0Gy between 2004 and 2014 (AE2/RP2 rate: 50%/12%). A model was judged final if it significantly predicted AE2 or RP2 (p<=0.05), was discriminative and well calibrated (AUC>0.60; Hosmer-Lemeshow test pHL>0.05), which were assessed as the median over 1000 bootstrap samples., RESULTS: Models for AE2 had superior discrimination to RP2 models (AUC=0.63-0.65 vs. 0.51-0.65). The final AE2 model included mean esophageal dose and concurrent chemotherapy (AUC=0.65; p<0.0001). The final RP2 model was a slightly adjusted version of the RP2 model with the best discrimination, and included age, mean lung dose, and pulmonary comorbidity (AUC=0.73; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Of the eight investigated and published NTCP models, one model successfully described AE2 and one slightly adjusted model successfully described RP2 in the independent cohort. Estimates from these two NTCP models will, therefore, be considered internally when prescribing patient-specific doses in LA-NSCLC patients. Copyright Published by Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1230,"Potential welfare impacts of kill-trapping European moles (Talpa europaea) using scissor traps and Duffus traps: A Post mortem examination study Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.Copyright © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Excluded
513,"Options for the modified radiation weighting factor of neutrons The recent ICRP Report 92 has noted that the current radiation weighting factor, wR, depends on the energy of the incident neutrons in a manner that differs substantially from the dependence, which results from the current convention, QL. At all neutron energies, but most conspicuously below 1 MeV, the values of wR exceed those of the effective quality factor, qE. The discrepancy is largely due to the fact that--in the absence of computed values of the effective quality factor for neutrons--wR has been patterned after the values of the ambient quality factor, which accounts insufficiently for the low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma ray component from neutron capture in the human body. There are different options to remove the discrepancy. Option 1 is to reduce wR substantially at all neutron energies to make it equal to qE for a standard condition, such as isotropic incidence of the neutrons. Since such a reduction may cause problems in those countries where the current wR values are already legally implemented, ICRP 92 has proposed what is here termed Option 2. It recommended to replace QL by the increased value 1.6 QL - 0.6 and, accordingly, to make the radiation weighting factor equal to 1.6 qE - 0.6. With Option 2 the radiation weighting factor needs to be decreased appreciably at low neutron energies, but for fission neutron spectra the overall changes are minor. To guide--regardless which option is chosen--the selection of the numerical values, the effective quality factor, qE, is computed here for different directional distributions of neutrons incident on the anthropomorphic phantoms ADAM and EVA. None of the sex averaged numerical values is found to deviate much from those for isotropic incidence. Isotropic incidence can, thus, be used as an adequate standard condition. A numerical approximation is proposed for the standard qE that is nearly equivalent to a formula invoked by ICRP 92, but is somewhat simpler and provides realistic values of qE even for the extremely high neutron energies in space. In line with ICRP 92, it is emphasised that wR needs to be seen as a derived quantity related to the LET-dependent weighting factor. Copyright 2004 Oxford University Press",Excluded
1255,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

340,"Explorative study on the predictive value of systematic inflammatory and metabolic markers on weight loss in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the predictive value of systematic inflammatory and metabolic markers in head and neck (H&N) cancer patients during radiotherapy (RT)., METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were evaluated. The protocol included serial blood tests [highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), albumin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) and ghrelin], measurements of body weight and assessment of oral mucositis., RESULTS: The mean nadir of weight loss was observed at the end of RT. At the time of diagnosis, mean hsCRP was 5.2 +/- 1.0 mg/L. HsCRP significantly increased during RT and decreased during the post-RT period. Mean maximum hsCRP was 35.8 +/- 8.5 mg/L, with seven patients reaching >40 mg/L. A numerical decrease of albumin (by 18.2%) and only small changes in IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and ghrelin levels were observed. None of the metabolic parameters was significantly associated with weight loss., CONCLUSIONS: HsCRP increased in response to RT for H&N cancer as a sign of irradiation-induced inflammation. Weight loss was not preceded by changes of the metabolic parameters, indicating that assessment of the blood markers used in this study is of little value. Regular body weight measurement and assessment of oral mucositis are feasible, cheap and important procedures to control the metabolic homeostasis during RT.",Excluded
280,"Sorafenib acts synergistically in combination with radiotherapy without causing intestinal damage in colorectal cancer AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest cancers. Chemoradiotherapy gives better results than radiotherapy or chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. To enhance radiosensitivity of tumor cells for chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy drugs that act as radiosensitizers can be used. In the present study, we provide a scientific rationale for the clinical application of sorafenib as a radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer, without causing significant adverse effects on normal intestinal tissue., METHODS: Three human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480) were treated with sorafenib alone, or radiation followed by sorafenib. In vitro tests were performed using colony forming assays, cell cycle analysis, and comet assays. In addition, the effects of sorafenib and radiation therapy on the inhibition HT-29 tumor growth and survival of intestinal jejunum crypts were examined in vivo., RESULTS: Sorafenib increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480), as well as in HT-29 xenograft animal models. Sorafenib, in combination with ionizing radiation, induced the accumulation of tumor cells in the G2-M phase and delayed the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. The combination of sorafenib and ionizing radiation did not enhance the apoptosis of intestinal crypt cells, compared with the use of radiation alone., CONCLUSIONS: We provide a scientific rationale for the use of sorafenib in combination with radiotherapy in colorectal cancer.",Excluded
85,"Analysis of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and conventional radiation treatment parameters after primary and re-irradiation of malignant glioma Background: Re-irradiation is a reasonable second treatment option for patients with recurrent malignant glioma (MG) after previous radio(chemo)therapy. However, only limited data is available allowing for a precise selection of patients suitable for re-treatment in regard to safety and efficacy. Method(s): Using the department database, 58 patients with two courses of percutaneous radiation were identified. Besides classical dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values were calculated for the tumor and organs at risk (OARs), retrospectively analyzed and correlated to survival outcome parameters. Cumulative EUD values were also calculated in all cases where previous OAR DVHs were available. Result(s): Median follow-up was 265 days and no relevant toxicity was observed after re-irradiation in our patient cohort during follow-up. Time interval between first and second irradiation was regularly above 6 months. As a conservative estimation of the cumulative EUD to the OARs, the EUDs of first and second irradiation were added. Median cumulative EUD to the optic chiasm was 48.8 Gy (range, 2.5-76.5 Gy), 57.4 Gy (range, 2.7-75.3 Gy) to the brainstem, 20.9/22.1 Gy (range, 0.0-68.3 Gy) to the right/left optic nerve and 73.8 Gy (range, 64.9-77.3 Gy) to the brain. No correlation between treated volume and survival was seen. Conclusion(s): This study provides retrospective estimates on cumulative doses at the OARs. EUD values are derived and may serve as reference for further studies, including planning studies where specific constraints are needed. © 2013 Niyazi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
563,"Use of electrocardiogram to position right atrial catheters during surgery OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the accuracy of placing right atrial catheters using an electrocardiographic (ECG) technique., SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Placement of right atrial catheters for vascular access is a common operative procedure. Accurate placement is essential for proper function. Previous placement techniques have used fluoroscopy, which is both time consuming and hazardous., METHODS: The accuracy of placement of 1236 right atrial catheters using an ECG technique was compared to placement of 586 catheters using fluoroscopy between March 1991 and November 1995. In the ECG technique, the catheter was flushed with sodium bicarbonate. A sterile left-leg ECG lead was attached to the catheter with the other ECG leads applied normally. On advancing the catheter through the superior vena cava, the P-wave amplitude (lead II) increased in negative deflection until greater than the QRS complex. Passing the sinoatrial node, the P-wave developed an initial positive then negative deflection. The catheter was positioned so the P-wave was biphasic, representing a position midway between the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. For the fluoroscopic technique, catheters were positioned under direct observation just within the atrium estimated from cardiac contour. Use of contrast was optional if atrial anatomy was unclear., RESULTS: Postoperative portable chest x-rays showed the ECG method to position the catheter tip within the right atrium just as accurately (average, 1.9 +/- 1.3 cm) as with the use of fluoroscopy (average, 1.1 +/- 1.6 cm). The ECG method eliminated an average of 20 seconds of radiation exposure, an average of 3.0 minutes operating room time (p < 0.04), avoided all risks of contrast dye, and saved $279.10 per case., CONCLUSIONS: The ECG method is a satisfactory alternative to that of fluoroscopy for placement of long-term central venous catheters into the right atrium.",Excluded
354,"Left bundle branch block and suspected myocardial infarction: Does chronicity of the branch block matter? Background: Our aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB). Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence of ST-segment concordance in this population. Method(s): Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at Orebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or >=80 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. Result(s): A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group >=80 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. Conclusion(s): The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test. © The European Society of Cardiology 2013.",Excluded

505,"Directly measured inflammation in psoriasis skin associates with vascular inflammation beyond traditional risk factors Background: Inflammation is critical to development and progression of atherosclerosis. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by skin and systemic inflammation, is associated with increased cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We have previously demonstrated increased vascular inflammation by FDG PET CT (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography) in psoriasis. It is currently unknown whether directly-quantified skin inflammation is related to CVD. We hypothesized that increased skin inflammation is associated with increased vascular inflammation persisting beyond adjustment for CVD risk factors. Method(s): Clinical and laboratory measures of inflammation were prospectively evaluated in 41 consecutive adult psoriasis patients (NCT01778569). Psoriasis severity was assessed using Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). Aortic vascular inflammation was assessed using a validated measurement from clinical trials, the target-to-background ratio (TBR), assessed by FDG PET/CT. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess for association between TBR and PASI, adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, tobacco use, alcohol and body mass index. Analyses were conducted using STATA 12.0 software. Result(s): No statistically significant difference was seen in demographic or metabolic risk factors between psoriasis severity groups. Framingham 10-year risk scores were low in our cohort (males mean 6.9, SD 5.4; females mean 4.5, SD 4.3; p=0.11). In unadjusted analyses, hsCRP (rho=0.34, p=0.03) and psoriasis body surface area (rho=0.79, p<0.001) were significantly associated with PASI. As expected, CVD risk factors were each associated with TBR (p<0.001 for all). Furthermore, as PASI increased, we observed increased TBR (unadjusted beta=0.007, p<0.01) beyond CVD risk factors (adjusted beta=0.002, p=0.012). Conclusion(s): Directly assessed skin inflammation independently associated with vascular inflammation beyond CVD risk factors. These findings suggest that inflammation in vivo in humans heightens the risk for CVD. Whether treatment of this inflammation modulates CVD risk is unknown, and is topic of ongoing study.",Excluded
364,"Short-course preoperative radiotherapy with delayed surgery in rectal cancer - a retrospective study PURPOSE: In the most advanced, non-resectable primary rectal cancers, conventional long-course radiotherapy (RT) (1.8-2Gyx25-28), frequently combined with chemotherapy, has been used since tumour regression is needed in order to allow a radical (R0) resection. In Uppsala, short-course 5x5Gy with planned delayed surgery has been used in patients with contraindications to long-course RT (+/-chemotherapy). The aim is to describe our experience of using this approach in patients not eligible for standard treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 2002 and 2005, 46 patients with non-resectable rectal cancer (+/-synchronous distant metastases) were treated with 5x5Gy and delayed surgery if possible. The clinical records were retrospectively evaluated. The first group (A) had no metastases (T4NXM0), whereas the other two groups (B+C) had metastases (T4NXM1). In group (B), the patients had predominantly loco-regional disease and were not candidates for combination chemotherapy (high age, co-morbidities), and in group (C) up-front combination chemotherapy was given, with the intention to have surgery of both the primary and the secondaries if sufficient regression at both sites were seen., RESULTS: The patients in the first two groups (A+B) were old (median 79 and 76 years, respectively), and had several co-morbidities. In group (C), median age was 63 years. The 5x5Gy RT was well tolerated by most patients, but grade IV diarrhoea was recorded in three elderly patients. One patient in the group (C) died from neutropenic fever. Many patients were reported to have less local symptoms after the treatment given. Delayed surgery was performed in all but nine patients. Radical surgery (R0+R1) was performed in 22 (92%) (group A), 4 (44%) (group B), and 6 (46%) (group C) patients, respectively. A pCR was seen in four patients (two in group A and two in group C). No postoperative deaths occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Considering the very high age and presence of co-morbidity, the 5x5Gy schedule is well tolerated. Further, considering the very advanced local stage, the schedule has considerable anti-tumour activity and can result in radical surgery in a high proportion of patients.",Excluded

839,"Photosensitivity induced by chemotherapy INTRODUCTION: Photosensitivity is a frequent dermatological complication of chemotherapy. It is defined by an inflammatory reaction of the photo-exposed zones at the time of solar exposure. This is related to aberrations induced in porphyrin biosynthesis and triggered by UVB. Photosensitivity is induced by many anticancer agents. Clinically, patients present with a rash that looks like a sunburn with erythema, edema, pain, pruritus. In more severe cases, we can observe bubbles with cutaneous abrasion. This rash predominates in the exposed areas. The treatment is based on emollients, antihistamines, topical corticosteroids and healing creams Objective: we describe the epidemiological, chronological, clinical, therapeutic and evolutionary characteristics of this dermatological toxicity of chemotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a prospective study spanning a period of 24 months, including patients followed in medical oncology for solid cancers under chemotherapy in an adjuvant or metastatic situation, addressed for dermatological complications of chemotherapy. Result(s): 350 patients were collected, photosensitivity was objectified in 150 patients, 20% of our patients had a severe form, 50% a moderate form and 30% a mild form. 60% of the patients were put on topical corticosteroids and 30% under healing creams. Chemical photoprotection was instituted in all patients. The evolution was favorable for all our patients. 25% developed secondary hyperpigmentation. Conclusion(s): Photosensitivity is a common and disabling side effect. It can lead, through the secondary hyperpigmentation, an important esthetic damage especially in the patients under chemotherapy. Hence the interest of awareness and photoprotection.",Excluded

845,"KTP laser therapy for bleeding from chronic radiation proctopathy BACKGROUND: Endoscopic laser photocoagulation is commonly used to treat bleeding from the neovascular lesions of chronic radiation proctopathy. The KTP laser is an Nd/YAG-driven unit that emits light with a wavelength of 532 nm. This wavelength of energy is absorbed by hemoglobin and penetrates tissue to a depth of only 1 to 2 mm., METHODS: Twenty-three patients were treated with KTP laser and followed for a median of 29 months (range 5 to 51 months); 21 had received radiation for prostate cancer and 2 for uterine cancer. The median age was 77 years (range 68 to 87 years). A median of 2 sessions (range 1 to 5 sessions) was performed using 4 to 10 Watts of power and a median energy of 816 Joules per session (range 204 to 2430 Joules)., RESULTS: After treatment there was a significant reduction in the frequency (p = 0.0005) of bleeding, increase in hematocrit level (p < 0.0001), improvement in activities of daily life (p = 0.01), and a reduction in use of health care resources (p < 0.0001). There was a trend toward decreased use of iron supplements (11 to 4 patients) and transfusions (4 to 0 patients).

We tested the evolutionary association between climate gradients and reflectance of near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, which influence heat gain but are not visible to animals. We measured ultraviolet (UVA), visible (Vis) and NIR reflectance from calibrated images of 372 butterfly specimens from 60 populations (49 species, five families) spanning the Australian continent. Consistent with selection for thermal benefits, the association between climate and reflectance was stronger for NIR than UVA-Vis wavelengths. Furthermore, climate predicted reflectance of the thorax and basal wing, which are critical to thermoregulation; but it did not predict reflectance of the entire wing, which has a variable role in thermoregulation depending on basking behaviour. These results provide evidence that selection for thermal benefits has shaped the reflectance properties of butterflies.",Excluded
661,"Cost-effectiveness of computed tomography screening for lung cancer in the United States INTRODUCTION: A randomized trial has demonstrated that lung cancer screening reduces mortality. Identifying participant and program characteristics that influence the cost-effectiveness of screening will help translate trial results into benefits at the population level.
METHODS: Six U.S. cohorts (men and women aged 50, 60, or 70 years) were simulated in an existing patient-level lung cancer model. Smoking histories reflected observed U.S. patterns. We simulated lifetime histories of 500,000 identical individuals per cohort in each scenario. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained ($/QALY) were estimated for each program: computed tomography screening; stand-alone smoking cessation therapies (4-30% 1-year abstinence); and combined programs.
RESULTS: Annual screening of current and former smokers aged 50 to 74 years costs between $126,000 and $169,000/QALY (minimum 20 pack-years of smoking) or $110,000 and $166,000/QALY (40 pack-year minimum), when compared with no screening and assuming background quit rates. Screening was beneficial but had a higher cost per QALY when the model included radiation-induced lung cancers. If screen participation doubled background quit rates, the cost of annual screening (at age 50 years, 20 pack-year minimum) was below $75,000/QALY. If screen participation halved background quit rates, benefits from screening were nearly erased. If screening had no effect on quit rates, annual screening costs more but provided fewer QALYs than annual cessation therapies. Annual combined screening/cessation therapy programs at age 50 years costs $130,500 to $159,700/QALY, when compared with annual stand-alone cessation.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of computed tomography screening will likely be strongly linked to achievable smoking cessation rates. Trials and further modeling should explore the consequences of relationships between smoking behaviors and screen participation.",Excluded
1183,"Evaluation of automated lung nodule detection on low-dose computed tomography scans from a lung cancer screening program(1) RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a fully automated lung nodule detection method in a large database of low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans from a lung cancer screening program. Because nodules demonstrate a spectrum of radiologic appearances, the performance of the automated method was evaluated on the basis of nodule malignancy status, size, subtlety, and radiographic opacity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database of 393 thick-section (10 mm) low-dose CT scans was collected. Automated lung nodule detection proceeds in two phases: gray-level thresholding for the initial identification of nodule candidates, followed by the application of a rule-based classifier and linear discriminant analysis to distinguish between candidates that correspond to actual lung nodules and candidates that correspond to non-nodules. Free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the method based on a jackknife training/testing approach., RESULTS: An overall nodule detection sensitivity of 70% (330 of 470) was attained with an average of 1.6 false-positive detections per section. At the same false-positive rate, 83% (57 of 69) of the malignant lung nodules in the database were detected. When the method was trained specifically for malignant nodules, a sensitivity of 80% (55 of 69) was attained with 0.85 false-positives per section., CONCLUSION: We have evaluated an automated lung nodule detection method with a large number of low-dose CT scans from a lung cancer screening program. An overall sensitivity of 80% for malignant nodules was achieved with 0.85 false-positive detections per section. Such a computerized lung nodule detection method is expected to become an important part of CT-based lung cancer screening programs.",Excluded
948,"Point-of-care ultrasound for confirmation of gastrostomy tube replacement in the pediatric emergency department Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are frequently used in children for feeding and nutrition. Complications related to G-tubes (and G-buttons) in children represent a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). G-tube replacement is usually performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Misplacement may lead to tract disruption, perforation, fistula tract formation, or feeding into the peritoneum. Contrast-enhanced radiographs are traditionally used for confirmation. In addition to a longer length-of-stay, repeat ED visits result in repeated radiation exposure. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) instead of radiography avoids this exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we describe three patients who presented with G-tube complications in whom POCUS alone performed by pediatricians was used for confirmation of the tubes' replacement. Two children presented to the ED with G-tube dislodgement, and one child presented with a ruptured balloon. In all three cases, a new G-tube was replaced at the bedside using POCUS guidance without the need for further radiographic studies. There were no known ED or clinic returns for G-tube complaints over the next 30 days. This is the first report of pediatricians using POCUS to guide and confirm G-tube replacement in children. The success of these cases suggests the technique's feasibility. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the learning curves, diagnostic accuracy, ED length-of-stay, and use of confirmatory imaging.",Excluded

561,"Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for tonsillar carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background: We performed this study to analyze treatment outcomes and to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with tonsillar carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with tonsillar carcinoma treated with RT between January 1979 and September 2009. Of the 164 patients, 91 were treated with 2-dimensional RT (2D-RT), 46 were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), and 27 were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). When patients were treated with IMRT, simultaneous integrated boost was used. Thirty patients were treated with RT alone, 40 patients were treated with chemotherapy and RT (CRT), 66 patients were treated with surgery and RT and/or chemotherapy (SRT), and 28 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Bilateral neck irradiation was delivered to 141 patients, and ipsilateral neck irradiation to 23 patients. In definitive RT, median dose was 70 Gy (range, 51-71), 70 Gy (54-74), and 67.5 Gy for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. In postoperative RT, median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 54-70.2), 66 Gy (54-70), and 63 Gy (60-67.5) for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. Acute and late toxicity were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 42 months (range, 2-288). The 5-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 94%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, 5-year DFS rate was associated with the RT technique (2DRT, 77%; 3D-CRT, 82%; IMRT, 100%, p = 0.035), T stage (T1-2, 87%; T3-4, 74%, p = 0.036), and treatment modality (RT alone, 55%; CRT, 78%; SRT, 92%; CCRT, 92%, p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, advanced T stage and treatment modality were statistically significant prognostic factors in DFS rate. None of the patients who were treated with ipsilateral neck irradiation experienced relapse in contralateral neck nodes. After the completion of RT, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade >=2 xerostomia 91%, 58%, 59%, 35%, and 78%, respectively. At least 6 months of follow-up, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade <=1 xerostomia 52%, 76%, 78%, 98%, and 63%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In selected patients with well lateralized tonsillar carcinoma, ipsilateral neck irradiation can be an alternative to bilateral neck irradiation, regarding DFS rate and complications. There was no failure when patients were treated with IMRT, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the 72.0 Gy in 42 fractions/6 weeks). The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate of patients who completed >= 70% of the cetuximab planned dose administration (in terms of the relative dose intensity of cetuximab) and the full dose of radiotherapy >= 2 weeks over the planned schedule (in terms of radiotherapy duration >=8 weeks). Result(s): From Mar 2009 until Jan 2010, 27 pts were screened. Of them, 22 pts were enrolled and treated (ITT population). Patients characteristics of ITT population: median age (years), 67.0 (range, 53 to 81); male/female, 21/1 pts; oropharynx/hypopharynx/larynx, 6/8/8 pts; stage III/IV, 12/10 pts. The median duration of cetuximab treatment was 7.9 weeks (range, 7 to 9), and that of RT was 44.0 days (range, 40 to 52). All 22 pts completed the treatment, and the completion rate was 100% (95% CI: 84.6%, 100.0%). The response rate (CR+PR) post RT was 81.8% (assessed by the independent committee). All pts experienced AEs. Most common AEs with grade 3/4 were mucosal inflammation (16pts, 72.7%), dermatitis (6pts, 27.3%), infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (each in 5 pts, 22.7%). Conclusion(s): The completion rate (100%) and the response rate (81.8%) are comparable to those of the cetuximab + RT group in the multinational randomized phase III study (Bonner et al. 2006). AEs were consistent with the underlying disease, administration of RT or cetuximab. The study results demonstrate that cetuximab + RT is well-tolerated, a feasible and efficacious treatment in Japanese pts. superiority of IMRT.

679,"Radiation dose and image quality in pediatric chest CT: effects of iterative reconstruction in normal weight and overweight children BACKGROUND: New CT reconstruction techniques may help reduce the burden of ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVE: To quantify radiation dose reduction when performing pediatric chest CT using a low-dose protocol and 50% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) compared with age/gender-matched chest CT using a conventional dose protocol and reconstructed with filtered back projection (control group) and to determine its effect on image quality in normal weight and overweight children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 40 pediatric chest CT (M:F = 21:19; range: 0.1-17 years) in both groups. Radiation dose was compared between the two groups using paired Student's t-test. Image quality including noise, sharpness, artifacts and diagnostic acceptability was subjectively assessed by three pediatric radiologists using a four-point scale (superior, average, suboptimal, unacceptable). RESULTS: Eight children in the ASIR group and seven in the control group were overweight. All radiation dose parameters were significantly lower in the ASIR group (P < 0.01) with a greater than 57% dose reduction in overweight children. Image noise was higher in the ASIR group in both normal weight and overweight children. Only one scan in the ASIR group (1/40, 2.5%) was rated as diagnostically suboptimal and there was no unacceptable study. CONCLUSION: In both normal weight and overweight children, the ASIR technique is associated with a greater than 57% mean dose reduction, without significantly impacting diagnostic image quality in pediatric chest CT examinations. However, CT scans in overweight children may have a greater noise level, even when using the ASIR technique.",Excluded
683,"A side-hole catheter for catheterization of a difficult internal mammary artery Background The internal mammary artery (IMA) can be a source of hemoptysis in patients with chronic lung disease. Intervention via the IMA can be a challenge due to anatomic variations and lead to excessive contrast use and radiation exposure. Purpose To evaluate safety and efficiency of a new side-hole catheter for the catheterization of the IMA in patients with hemoptysis. Material and Methods From January 2011 to August 2014, a total of 96 transarterial embolization procedures required exact evaluation of the IMA due to chronic lung disease involving the anterior thorax. In 17 cases (18%) of these 96 procedures, the conventional selective IMA angiography failed and instead a novel side-hole catheter as a modification of a cobra-type curved catheter was used. The side hole allowed passage of a micro-wire and catheter. Results Failed catheterizations were due to severe vascular tortuosity, acutely angulated subclavian artery, or abnormal takeoff of the IMA. The Cobra shaped catheter with the microcatheter through the side-hole catheter yielded a technical success rate of 100%. Longer time was required to catheterize the IMA with the Cobra shaped catheter than with the side-hole catheter (17 vs. 2 min, P < 0.05). There were no procedure-related complications. Conclusion Side-hole catheter technique is useful in patients whose internal mammary artery is difficult to access. Further design revisions are needed to improve the ease and speed of IMA catheterization and angiography.",Excluded
591,"Predictors of pulmonary toxicity in limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 70Gy daily radiotherapy: CALGB 30904 Introduction: Standard therapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (L-SCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. Predictors of post chemoradiotherapy pulmonary toxicity in limited stage (LS) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients are not well defined. Current guidelines are derived from non-small cell lung cancer regimens, and do not account for the unique biology of this disease. Therefore, we analyzed patients on three consecutive CALGB LS-SCLC trials treated with concurrent chemotherapy and daily high dose radiotherapy (70. Gy) to determine patient and treatment related factors predicting for post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Method(s): Patients treated on CALGB protocols 39808, 30002, 30206 investigating two cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and 70. Gy daily thoracic radiation therapy were pooled. Patient, tumor, and treatment related factors were evaluated to determine predictors of grade 3-5 pulmonary toxicities after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): 100 patients were included. No patient experienced grade 4-5 post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Patients who experienced post-treatment pulmonary toxicity were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs 60, p= 0.09) and have smaller total lung volumes (2565 cc vs 3530 cc, p= 0.05).). Furthermore, exposure of larger volumes of lung to lower (median V5. = 70%, p= 0.09, median V10. = 63%, p= 0.07), intermediate (median V20. = 50, p= 0.04) and high (median V60. = 25%, p= 0.01) doses of radiation were all associated with post-treatment grade 3 pulmonary toxicity, as was a larger mean lung radiation dose (median 31. Gy) p= 0.019. Conclusion(s): Post-treatment pulmonary toxicity following the completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and high dose daily radiation therapy was uncommon. Care should be taken to minimize mean lung radiation exposure, as well as volumes of low, intermediate and high doses of radiation. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
646,"Ex vivo radiosensitivity is increased in non-cancer patients taking valproate BACKGROUND: Valproate (VPA) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug for patients experiencing epileptic seizures due to brain tumors. VPA increases radiation sensitivity in various tumor cells in vitro due to complex mechanisms. This could make tumors more vulnerable to ionizing radiation or overcome radioresistance. Yet, clinical data on possible improvement of tumor control by adding VPA to tumor therapy is controversial. Potentially radiosensitizing effects of VPA on healthy tissue remain unclear. To determine individual radiosensitivity, we analyzed blood samples of individuals taking VPA., METHODS: Ex vivo irradiated blood samples of 31 adult individuals with epilepsy were studied using 3-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were analyzed. Radiosensitivity was determined by the mean breaks per metaphase (B/M) and compared to age-matched (2:1) healthy donors., RESULTS: The patient cohort (n = 31; female: 38.7%) showed an increase of their average B/M value compared to healthy individuals (n = 61; female: 56.9%; B/M: 0.480 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.415 +/- 0.07; p = .001). The portion of radiosensitive (B/M > 0.500) and distinctly radiosensitive individuals (B/M > 0.600) was increased in the VPA group (54.9% vs. 11.3 and 9.7% vs. 0.0%; p < .001). In 3/31 patients, radiosensitivity was determined prior to and after VPA treatment and radiosensitivity was increased by VPA-treatment., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we confirmed that patients treated with VPA had an increased radiosensitivity compared to the control group. This could be considered in patients taking VPA prior to the beginning of radiotherapy to avoid toxic side effects of VPA-treatment.",Excluded
140,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001). Chromosomal translocations were more frequent with repeated CT-exposed patients than in CT-naive patients, and a positive dose-response relationship was present between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency.",Included

The flattened-cell form of cancer with or without keratosis was diagnosed in 82.7%; other forms of cancer-in 17.3% cases. Sarcoma in women was diagnosed 3.5 times as often as in men. Tumours of the I stage were found in 12, of the II stage in 34. of the III stage in 146, of the IV stage in 73 patients. All patients were subjected to combined treatment-telegammatherapy and resection of the tumour with an electroknife. Patients with cancer of the I stage were first operated on with the electroknife and then subjected to radiotherapy with a focal dose of 3000-4000 rad. The 34 patients with cancer of the II stage underwent preoperative radiotherapy with a focal dose of 4500 to 5000 rad, then surgical intervention followed in 2-5 weeks. Preoperative radiotherapy was practiced in the 146 patients with cancer of the III stage, the total dose per focus being 5000-6000 rad, surgical intervention followed in 3-5 weeks.

In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population.

Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded
753,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancer-a phase I-II study of radiotherapy with dose escalation of weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine chemotherapy Background: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil improves gastric cancer outcome. We previously demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy with a more intensified-and therefore potentially more effective-schedule with daily cisplatin and oral capecitabine is feasible. Because such an intensive schedule requires an extensive logistic infrastructure which is not available in every hospital, we additionally investigated the tolerability of this combined regimen with weekly instead of daily cisplatin in a dose-escalation study. Patients and Methods: After R0 or R1 resection, treatment initiated with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 2 weeks and 1-week rest. Subsequently, patients received capecitabine (575-650 mg/m2 orally b.i.d., 5 days/week) and cisplatin (20-25 mg/m2 i.v., once weekly) according to a predefined dose-escalation schedule concurrent with radiation. Radiotherapy was given to a fixed total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Result(s): Thirty-one patients were eligible and started treatment. During chemoradiotherapy, seven patients developed 10 items of grade III and one episode of grade IV (mainly hematological) toxicity (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0). The maximum tolerable dose was determined to be for cisplatin 20 mg/m2 i.v. weekly and for capecitabine 575 mg/m2 b.i.d. orally.

811,"Clinical and lung ultrasonographic features of transient tachypnea of newborn in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore Introduction: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) also called wet lung, occurs due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. The diagnosis of TTN was primarily based on medical history, clinical manifestations, arterial blood gas analysis, and chest radiography (CXR). It is estimated that over 70% of infants with TTN are clinically misdiagnosed with Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging technique that could be used for early detection of TTN. This study aims to evaluate the value of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of TTN in late-preterm and full-term neonates. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty five late preterm and term neonates with signs of respiratory distress were included in this prospective observational study from January 2016 to June 2017. Lung ultrasound was done within the first 24 hours of birth and assessed according to the observation indices like A-line, B-line and Double lung point. Result(s): On lung ultrasound, 53 (81.5%) neonates showed the feature of double lung point (DLP) while 41 (63.1%) neonates showed A-line. The respiratory symptoms subsided in 38 (58.4%) babies at room air while only 2 (3.1%) babies required continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. The DLP feature on LUS was significantly more in babies born to primi mothers than multigravida (p value 0.02) and those delivered through LSCS when compared to babies delivered vaginally (p value-0.01). Conclusion(s): TTN is a self-limiting condition and treatment is mainly supportive. The results of this study further demonstrate that LUS can accurately and reliably diagnose TTN. Therefore, significantly reducing the need for chest X-rays and ultimately result in lower exposure of a neonate to ionizing radiation. This will aid in counselling the parents regarding its benign nature and conservative management. Copyright © 2019, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.",Excluded

The purpose of this pilot study was to test the potential of non-thermal pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) treatments (660 nm) prior to UV exposure in the induction of a state of cellular resistance against UV-induced erythema., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects and two patients with polymorphous light eruption (PLE) were exposed to 5, 6, or 10 LED treatments (660 nm) on an EXPERIMENTAL anterior thigh region. Individual baseline minimal erythema doses (MED) were then determined. UV radiation was thereafter performed on the LED EXPERIMENTAL and CONTROL anterior thigh areas. Finally, 24 hours post-UV irradiation, LED pre-treated MED responses were compared to the non-treated sites., RESULTS: Reduction of erythema was considered significant when erythema was reduced by >50% on the LED-treated side as opposed to CONTROL side. A significant LED treatment reduction in UV-B induced erythema reaction was observed in at least one occasion in 85% of subjects, including patients suffering from PLE. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-related pattern in results. Finally, a sun protection factor SPF-15-like effect and a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were observed on the LED pre-treated side., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that LED based therapy prior to UV exposure provided significant protection against UV-B induced erythema. The induction of cellular resistance to UV insults may possibly be explained by the induction of a state a natural resistance to the skin via specific cell signaling pathways and without the drawbacks and limitations of traditional sunscreens. These results represent an encouraging step towards expanding the potential applications of LED therapy and could be useful in the treatment of patients with anomalous reactions to sunlight.",Excluded
256,"Radiation Exposure From CT Scanning in the Resuscitative Phase of Trauma Care: A Level One Trauma Centre Experience OBJECTIVES: The initial management of a trauma patient often involves imaging in the form of x-rays, computed tomography (CT) and other radiographic studies, which expose the patient to ionizing radiation, an entity known to cause tissue injury and malignancy at high doses. The purpose of this study was to use a calculation-based method to determine the radiation exposure of trauma patients undergoing trauma team activation in a Canadian tertiary-care trauma centre. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted using the Nova Scotia Provincial Trauma Registry. All patients age 16 years old and over who underwent trauma team activation between March 1, 2008 and March 1, 2009 were included. Patients who died prior to imaging tests were excluded. Dose reports for each CT were used to calculate a whole-body radiation dose for each patient. RESULTS: There were 230 trauma team activations during the study period, of which 206 had CT imaging. Data were available for 162 patients. The mean whole-body radiation exposure for all patients was 24.4+/-10.3 mSv, which may correlate to one additional cancer death for every 100 trauma patients scanned. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma patients are exposed to significant amounts of radiation during their initial trauma work-up, which may increase the risk of fatal cancer. Clinicians who care for these patients must be aware of the radiation exposure, and take measures to limit radiation exposure of trauma patients.",Excluded
330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded
695,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival., RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded
637,"Multiple shifts to different pollinators fuelled rapid diversification in sexually deceptive Ophrys orchids Episodes of rapid speciation provide unique insights into evolutionary processes underlying species radiations and patterns of biodiversity. Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the evolution of the key innovation of sexual deception suggests that Ophrys diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportunities provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication systems, and by spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pollinator mosaic.",Excluded
131,"An in silico planning study comparing doses and estimated risk of toxicity in 3D-CRT, IMRT and proton beam therapy of patients with thymic tumours PURPOSE: To compare the dose distributions produced in patients (pts) treated for thymic tumours with spot-scanning proton beam therapy (PBT) implemented with single-field uniform dose (SFUD), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal photon-beam based radiotherapy (3D-CRT)., METHODS: Twelve pts, treated with 3D-CRT, were included. Alternative IMRT and SFUD plans were constructed. The IMRT plans were created using a setup with beams incident from 5 to 6 different angles. For the SFUD plans, a field-specific planning target volume (PTV) was created for each patient and a clinical target volume (CTV)-based robust optimization was performed. A robustness evaluation was performed for the CTV for all SFUD plans. A dosimetric evaluation was conducted for the doses to the CTV and organs at risk (OARs) for all plans. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), for different endpoints, was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB)-model and compared between plans., RESULTS: SFUD was associated with significantly lower mean doses to the oesophagus, the heart, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), lungs and breasts compared to 3D-CRT and IMRT. The maximum dose given to the spinal cord was significantly lower with SFUD. The risks for pneumonitis, esophagitis and myelopathy were significantly reduced in the SFUD plans., CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed dosimetric advantages of using scanned-beam PBT for the treatment of thymic tumours, as compared to 3D-CRT and IMRT, especially in regard to lower doses to the oesophagus and lungs. The risk of toxicity was reduced with SFUD. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
196,"Iodine isotope (131I) therapy for toxic nodular goitre: Treatment efficacy parameters BACKGROUND: When planning radioactive iodine therapy, it frequently happens, both in Poland and world-wide, that inadequate attention is paid to such easily measurable parameters as: 1) the serum concentration of thyrotropin (TSH) before administering radioiodine, which is a key factor for extranodular (non-autonomous) iodine uptake of the thyroid gland, 2) thyroid gland iodine uptake, and 3) the effective half-life of 131I (Teff.). The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the above factors on the efficacy of 131I treatment in hyperthyroid patients. METHOD(S): The material consisted of 4140 patients: 2190 with autonomous toxic nodules (ATN) and 1950 with toxic multinodular goitres (TMG). The patients were prepared for treatment in such away that the concentration of TSH did not exceed 0.1 mU/I and Teff. < 5 days. The therapeutic activity of 131I was calculated using Marinelli's formula. The selection of absorbed dose value was determined by the degree of suppression of extranodular tissue. Monitoring was performed every eight weeks. RESULT(S): At one year after 131I administration showed that a euthyroid status was achieved in 94%, hypothyroidism was seen observed in 3%, while persistence or recurrence of hyperthyroidism in 3% of ATN patients and, respectively, 89%, 4% and 7% of TMG patients. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with toxic nodular goitre who are to be treated with radioiodine should have the lowest possible serum concentration of TSH. The suppression of extranodular deter- mines the optimal value of absorbed dose for Marinelli's formula. Copyright © 2012 Via Medica.",Excluded
318,"Prospective Pilot Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Purpose: With the improvement concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), distant failures have become a more relevant problem in terms of survival. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation after primary CCRT for patients with HNSCC. Methods and Materials: Patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on Days 1, 22, and 43. Concurrent radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck was given in a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 70-70.2 Gy over 7 weeks. After completion of CCRT, patients without evidence of disease progression received an additional four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Result(s): Of 33 patients, 27 (81%) completed CCRT. After CCRT, three complete and 19 partial responses were recorded, giving an overall response rate of 67%. Of 19 patients who went to the consolidation phase, only 4 (21%) received all four cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin. Causes of failure of consolidation chemotherapy were toxicity in 11 patients, including three treatment-related deaths, and progression in 4 patients. Three patients died of sepsis during the consolidation phase. Median survival was 11 months for all patients and 8 months for those treated with consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The poor compliance and high incidence of severe toxicities prompted no further evaluation of this consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

951,"Clinical trial of post-chemotherapy consolidation thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Background and purpose: To define the rate of development of symptomatic chest failures in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) after undergoing post-chemotherapy chest radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients had ES-SCLC, attained an objective response to chemotherapy and signed study consent. Target accrual was 33 patients. Patients were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) as per department policy. PCI (25 Gy/10 fractions) and chest RT (40 Gy/15 fractions) were given simultaneously 4-8 weeks after chemotherapy completion. Thoracic target volume was the post-chemotherapy residual chest disease plus margin. Patients were evaluated for RT toxicities, local control, disease-free and overall survival. Result(s): Thirty-two patients were evaluable. Twenty-nine patients completed RT without delay. There were 4 complete responses and 28 partial responses to chemotherapy. All study patients received PCI. Maximal acute RT toxicity was grade 2 esophagitis (18 patients). There were no RT-related deaths. Median time to disease progression and overall survival were 4.2 and 8.3 months, respectively (median follow-up = 21.8 months). Of 16 chest recurrences, 7 were in the irradiated region and 5 were symptomatic.

Here we present the results of an unbiased, comprehensive genome-wide survey of the range of germline mutations induced in laboratory mice after parental exposure to ionizing radiation and show irradiation markedly alters the frequency and spectrum of de novo mutations. Here we show that the frequency of de novo copy number variants (CNVs) and insertion/deletion events (indels) is significantly elevated in offspring of exposed fathers. We also show that the spectrum of induced de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is strikingly different; with clustered mutations being significantly over-represented in the offspring of irradiated males. Our study highlights the specific classes of radiation-induced DNA lesions that evade repair and result in germline mutation and paves the way for similarly comprehensive characterizations of other germline mutagens.Copyright © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Excluded

PORT was indicated in patients with positive surgical margins, T4 tumors, or extracapsular nodal infiltration. RT consisted of 66 Gy (2 Gy/fr) in 5 weeks and 3 days. Median follow-up was 21 months (range 2-59)., RESULTS: Acute morbidity was acceptable: grade 3 mucositis in 20 (22%) patients, grade 3 dysphagia in 22 (25%) patients, and grade 3 skin erythema in 18 (20%) patients. Median weight loss was 2 kg (range 0-14.5). No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Late effects included grade 3 xerostomia in 6 (7%) patients, and grade 3 edema in 2 (2%) patients. Median time to locoregional relapse was 10 months (range 2-21). Two-year overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59-81), 75% (95% CI 64-86), and 63% (95% CI 52-74), respectively. The 2-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 80% (95% CI 70-90). Distant metastasis probability at 4 years was 38% (95% CI 20-56). Multivariate analysis revealed that pT-classification (pT1-2 vs. pT3-4) and extranodal extension (0, 1 vs. 2 or more) were the two factors independently influencing the outcome., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reducing the overall treatment time using an accelerated PORT schedule including a once-weekly concomitant boost (six fractions per week) is easily feasible with excellent local control. Acute and late RT-related morbidity is acceptable. Given the disease progression pattern (distant metastases), adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered.",Excluded
979,"Tryptophan metabolism in the non-tumoral hemisphere: A pet study of 99 glioma patients BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) can track serotonin synthesis (in brain) and also the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway (often activated in gliomas). Tumoral AMT uptake can predict tumor type and distinguish radiation injury from glioma recurrence.Now we analyzed clinical correlates of decreased AMT uptake in the contralateral hemisphere of glioma patients (reported recently: Juhasz et al. Clin Nucl Med, 2012;37:838-42). METHOD(S): We analyzed 99 (46/53 pre-/post-treatment) AMT-PET scans of patients (mean age: 52 years) with WHO grade II-IV glioma. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and unidirectional AMT uptake (K-complex, a measure of brain serotonin synthesis; available in 93 cases) were quantified in cortical and subcortical regions of the non-tumoral hemisphere. The effect of gender, age, tumor grade, and treatment on cortical/subcortical AMT uptake, and associations with survival (in the post-treatment group), were analyzed. RESULT(S): AMT K-complex was higher in females than males in the thalamus (p = .012, t-test) and frontal cortex (p = .047) in the whole group and in post-treatment patients (p = .017 and p = .009, respectively). Females also had higher thalamic SUV than males in the whole group (p = .029). AMT K-complex in the thalamus showed a moderate decline with age in the whole group (Pearson's r = -0.24; p = .009) and in the post-treatment subgroup (r = -0.34; p = .023). There was no difference in AMT-PET parameters between the pre- and post-treatment subgroups, and no correlation was found between cortical/subcorticalAMT-PET parameters and tumor grade. Higher thalamic and putaminal SUV predicted shorter survival (log-rank: p = 0.003, p = 0.013, respectively), but not independently from tumoral SUV. CONCLUSION(S): While glioma grade and treatment do not appear to directly affect tryptophan metabolism in the non-tumoral hemisphere, an age-related decline and gender differences, in subcortical structures and/or frontal cortex, may occur, particularly post-treatment. This could indicate remote serotonergic abnormalities whose relation to clinical symptoms (e.g., glioma-associated depression) and clinical outcome warrants further studies.",Excluded

All 35 patients received fixed activities of 7.8 GBq 177Lu-octreotate each 8 weeks, with 14 days of capecitabine 1500 mg/m2 for 4 cycles. In phase I, successive cohorts of patients received escalating doses of temozolomide in groupings of 100, 150, and 200 mg/m2 in the last 5 days of each capecitabine cycle. In phase II, patients were treated with 200 mg/m2 temozolomide. Treatment was well tolerated in all dosage groups. No dose-limiting grade 2, 3, or 4 toxicities were seen in cohorts 1 (100 mg/m2) or 2 (150 mg/m2). Twenty-eight patients completed treatment at the 200 mg/m2 temozolomide level. Adverse events were mild to moderate. The commonest toxicities were transient nausea grade 2 (18%), grade 3 (3%), thrombocytopenia grade 2 (24%), and neutropenia grade 3 (6%). There were no grade 4 events. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for tumor response. Overall, complete response (CR) was achieved in 15% (95% CI 3-27); partial response (PR), in 38% (95% CI 22-55); stable disease (SD), in 38% (95% CI 22-55); and 3 patients failed to respond to treatment. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 31 months (95% CI 21-33), and median overall survival (OS) has not been reached with 90% surviving at 24 months follow-up (range 21-30).

To examine the yield of an ultra-low-dose computed tomography (CT) transmission module for attenuation-correction (AC) on a dedicated cardiac camera in evaluation of SPECT-myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the diagnosis of CAD and for additional chest abnormalities. Methods. The study group included 150 patients with known or suspected CAD referred for technetium sestamibi SPECT MPI. CT transmission scanning (effective radiation 0.17 mSv) was performed after each gated SPECT scan. AC and non-corrected (NC) SPECT scans were evaluated on a 5-point scale using a 17-segment model, and the sum stress score (SSS) and sum rest score (SRS) were calculated for each condition. Overall image quality, sensitivity and normalcy rate (51 patients) and processing of 28 CT slices were screened for chest findings. Results. CT-based AC significantly improved image quality (P = .01). Mean SSS was 3.8 +/- 5.8 with AC and 6.1 +/- 7.1 with NC (P < .001); the respective SRS values were 2.6 +/- 6.3 and 3.9 +/- 7.7 (P < .001). The sensitivity of detecting >=70% stenosis was 71% and 86% (P = NS) and the normalcy rate was 30% and 89% (P < .0001) in NC and AC SPECT MPI, respectively. Chest CT: Lung abnormalities in 31%, aortic calcifications in 27%, and hiatus hernia in 5%. Conclusions.

338,"Reproducibility of intensity-based estimates of lung ventilation Purpose: Lung function depends on lung expansion and contraction during the respiratory cycle. Respiratory-gated CT imaging and image registration can be used to estimate the regional lung volume change by observing CT voxel density changes during inspiration or expiration. In this study, the authors examine the reproducibility of intensity-based estimates of lung tissue expansion and contraction in three mechanically ventilated sheep and ten spontaneously breathing humans. The intensity-based estimates are compared to the estimates of lung function derived from image registration deformation field. Method(s): 4DCT data set was acquired for a cohort of spontaneously breathing humans and anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep. For each subject, two 4DCT scans were performed with a short time interval between acquisitions. From each 4DCT data set, an image pair consisting of a volume reconstructed near end inspiration and a volume reconstructed near end exhalation was selected. The end inspiration and end exhalation images were registered using a tissue volume preserving deformable registration algorithm. The CT density change in the registered image pair was used to compute intensity-based specific air volume change (SAC) and the intensity-based Jacobian (IJAC), while the transformation-based Jacobian (TJAC) was computed directly from the image registration deformation field. IJAC is introduced to make the intensity-based and transformation-based methods comparable since SAC and Jacobian may not be associated with the same physiological phenomenon and have different units. Scan-to-scan variations in respiratory effort were corrected using a global scaling factor for normalization. A gamma index metric was introduced to quantify voxel-by-voxel reproducibility considering both differences in ventilation and distance between matching voxels. The authors also tested how different CT prefiltering levels affected intensity-based ventilation reproducibility. Result(s): Higher reproducibility was found for anesthetized mechanically ventilated animals than for the humans for both the intensity-based (IJAC) and transformation-based (TJAC) ventilation estimates. The human IJAC maps had scan-to-scan correlation coefficients of 0.45 +/- 0.14, a gamma pass rate 70 +/- 8 without normalization and 75 +/- 5 with normalization. The human TJAC maps had correlation coefficients 0.81 +/- 0.10, a gamma pass rate 86 +/- 11 without normalization and 93 +/- 4 with normalization. The gamma pass rate and correlation coefficient of the IJAC maps gradually increased with increased smoothing, but were still much lower than those of the TJAC maps. Conclusion(s): The transformation-based ventilation maps show better reproducibility than the intensity-based maps, especially in human subjects. Reproducibility was also found to depend on variations in respiratory effort; all techniques were better when applied to images from mechanically ventilated sheep compared to spontaneously breathing human subjects. Nevertheless, intensity-based techniques applied to mechanically ventilated sheep were less reproducible than the transformation-based applied to spontaneously breathing humans, suggesting the method used to determine ventilation maps is important. Prefiltering of the CT images may help to improve the reproducibility of the intensity-based ventilation estimates, but even with filtering the reproducibility of the intensity-based ventilation estimates is not as good as that of transformation-based ventilation estimates. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded

GERD patients were divided into as reflux esophagitis, acid-nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and weakly acid-NERD groups. Patients with normal esophageal mucosa, normal acid exposure and negative proton pump inhibitor test were enrolled in FH group. EGJ-CI (mmHg.cm) as well as EGJ rest pressure and 4s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4s) were measured., RESULTS: Among the 115 patients, 18 were reflux esophagitis [(49.0+/-18.9) years, M:F=10:8], 25 were acid-NERD [(48.7+/-14.4) years, M:F=13:12], 37 were weakly acid-NERD [(52.0+/-14.8) years, M:F=15:22] and 35 were FH [(53.6+/-14.8), M:F=8:27]. No differences of Gerd-Q scores were noticed between the four groups. (1)Negative correlations were demonstrated between EGJ-CI and esophageal acid exposure time (r=-0.283, P=0.002), EGJ-CI and acid reflux events (r=-0.233, P=0.012), EGJ-CI and weakly acid reflux events (r=-0.213, P=0.022), EGJ-CI and non-acid reflux events (r=-0.200, P=0.032). (2)The value of EGJ-CI was significantly higher in FH patients than in the three subgroups of GERD(all P<0.01). EGJ rest pressure of FH group was higher than that of acid-NERD (P<0.01). IRP 4s in acid-NERD group was lower than that of FH and weakly acid-NERD (P<0.05). (3)The area under curve (AUC) of EGJ-CI was higher than that of EGJ-CIT, EGJ rest pressure or IRP 4s(0.686 vs 0.678, 0.641 and 0.578). The cut-off value of EGJ-CI to differentiate GERD from FH was 9.74 mmHg.cm with sensitivity 82.86% and specificity 51.52%., CONCLUSIONS: The EGJ-CI values are negatively correlated with esophageal acid exposure time, weakly acid reflux events and non-acid reflux events. Thus it might be used as a metric to reflect the anti-reflux function of EGJ. According to the cut-off value of EGJ-CI 9.74 mmHg.cm, patients with GERD can be sensitively differentiated from patients with FH.",Excluded

The paper presents the results of ultrasonic investigations of the heart, arterial and venous peripheral vessels in different parts of human body, and measurements of leg veins capacity with the use of occlusive plethysmograpy. It was shown that in the resting condition such prime hemodynamic parameters as the pumping function of the heart and blood supply of the brain, and integral parameters, i.e. arterial pressure and heat rate, were best protected"" as they demonstrated stability throughout long exposure in microgravity. In the absence of gravitational stimulation, arterial resistance went down in essentially all vascular regions below the heart level; to put it differently, the anti-gravity distribution of the vascular tone was annulled gradually as unneeded in microgravity. Compared with the data about arteries, venous hemodynamics was found to be particularly sensitive considering the early advent and significance of changes. Venous return slowed down, resistance of the lower body vessels declined and capacity of the leg venous net increased. Functional testing with the lower body negative pressure revealed degradation of the gravity-dependent reactions that became more conspicuous as flight duration extended further. Cardiovascular deconditioning showed itself clearly on return to Earth's gravity by decreased g-tolerance during re-entry and orthostatic instability post flight. These investigations provided objective evidence for multifactorial genesis of orthostatic instability during space flight including blood redistribution, altered tone regulation of leg's venous and arterial vessels and hypovolemia.""",Excluded

These 3 methods were evaluated in healthy volunteers for scattering sensitivity and image artefacts. The S-matrix and real-time motion signals were calculated on the image calculation environment of the MR scanner. Prospective cardiac triggers were identified in early systole as a high rate of change of the cardiac motion signal. Monitoring accuracy was compared against electrocardiogram or the imaged diaphragm position., RESULTS: All 3 monitoring approaches measure the S-matrix during image excitation with quality correlated to input power. No image artefacts were observed for frequency multiplexing, and low energy artefacts were observed in the other methods. The accuracy of the achieved prospective cardiac gating was 15 +/- 16 ms for breath hold and 24 +/- 17 ms during free breathing. The diaphragm position prediction accuracy was 1.3 +/- 0.9 mm. In all volunteers, good quality cine images were acquired for breath hold scans and dual gated CINEs were demonstrated., CONCLUSION: The S-matrix can be measured during image excitation to generate real-time cardiac and respiratory motion signals for prospective gating. No artefacts are introduced when frequency division multiplexing is used. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

1112,"Impact of clinical and therapeutic factors on major late complications after radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy for anal carcinoma PURPOSE: To investigate factors potentially influencing major late morbidity after sphincter-conserving treatment for anal carcinoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Grade 3-4 complications were retrospectively analyzed in 144 evaluable patients (pts), 55 pts after split-course radiotherapy (RT), and 89 after concomitant chemo-RT. First sequence RT delivered a median dose of 39.6 Gy using megavoltage photon beams. Boost treatment used either 192Ir implantation or external beam RT (median dose 20 Gy). Chemotherapy started on day 1 and in 83% of pts consisted of Mitomycin-C (10 mg/m2) and a 5-day infusion of 5-fluorourcil (600-800 mg/m2/day). Uni- and multivariate analyses tested the association of following factors with complication rate: age, gender, stage, anatomic tumor extent, type of biopsy, external RT technique (dose, fraction size, field arrangement), boost type (brachytherapy vs. external), brachytherapy dose and dose rate, overall treatment time, and addition of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Five-year actuarial complication rate was 16%. Two variables were significantly associated with complication rate: anatomic tumor extent (canal or margin vs. both +/- rectum; 10 vs. 31% complications, p = 0.0004) and first sequence prescribed dose (< 39.6 Gy vs. > or = 39.6 Gy; 7 vs. 23% complications, p = 0.012), confirmed as independent factors by Cox analysis. Grade 4 anal morbidity correlated significantly with prior local excision. All six bone complications were observed in pts treated by chemo-RT using large pelvic fields, five occurring in pts older than 66., CONCLUSION: Pts with tumors involving more than one anatomic subsite or treated with the higher first sequence RT dose are at greater risk of major complications. Prior tumor excision and combined modality therapy in older pts appear to favor major anal and bone complications, respectively.",Excluded
1197,"A single antegrade intramedullary k-wire for fifth metacarpal neck fractures OBJECTIVES: Antegrade intramedullary nailing (AIMN) using 2k-wires seems to be superior to other modalities in treating displaced fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck (FFMN). Few reports demonstrated similar results retrospective with a single k-wire. The aim of the study is to describe our single k-wire technique and evaluate the related results. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective study of a continuous series of patients treated with a single intramedullary k-wire for FFMN. It includes 30 patients who met the criteria for surgery: a dorsal angulation of more than 30degree, malrotation, or both. The mean clinical follow-up period was 7+/-14.9 months. RESULT(S): The mean pre-operative angle was 50degree+/-11.35degree and the mean immediate post-operative angle was 4.86degree+/-2.8degree. The mean immediate correction was 47degree+/-9.3degree. The mean correction at last follow-up was 45.14degree+/-8.55degree. Healing was obtained in all patients and bone union was achieved at a mean of 5.6+/-1.2 weeks. The mean operative time was 8.5 min. The mean C-arm usage (number of clicks) was 7.2 times. The mean exposure radiation time was calculated at 3.6 s. The mean radiation dose was 0.08 mGy/mm2. The mean satisfaction score was 1.26+/-0.45. Quick-DASH and EQ-5D scores yielded excellent values. CONCLUSION(S): With potential benefits like lesser surgical time, radiation and cost, the use of a single AIMN could be safer, quicker and cheaper while reproducing similar clinical, functional and radiological outcomes to those reported with the use of 2k-wires.",Excluded
1222,"7T MRI-Histologic Correlation Study of Low Specific Absorption Rate T2-Weighted GRASE Sequences in the Detection of White Matter Involvement in Multiple Sclerosis BACKGROUND: The high value of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of radio-frequency (RF) energy arising from the series of RF refocusing pulses in T2-weighted (T2-w) turbo spin echo (TSE) MRI hampers its clinical application at 7.0 Tesla (7T). T2-w gradient and spin echo (GRASE) uses the speed from gradient refocusing in combination with the chemical-shift/static magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneity insensitivity from spin-echo refocusing to acquire T2-w images with a limited number of refocusing RF pulses, thus reducing SAR., OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether low SAR T2-w GRASE could replace T2-w TSE in detecting white matter (WM) disease in MS patients imaged at 7T., METHODS: The .7 mm3 isotropic T2-w TSE and T2-w GRASE images with variable echo times (TEs) and echo planar imaging (EPI) factors were obtained on a 7T scanner from postmortem samples of MS brains. These samples were derived from brains of 3 female MS patients. WM lesions (WM-Ls) and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) signal intensity, WM-Ls/NAWM contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and MRI/myelin staining sections comparisons were obtained., RESULTS: GRASE sequences with EPI factor/TE = 3/50 and 3/75 ms were comparable to the SE technique for measures of CNR in WM-Ls and NAWM and for detection of WM-Ls. In all sequences, however, identification of areas with remyelination, Wallerian degeneration, and gray matter demyelination, as depicted by myelin staining, was not possible., CONCLUSIONS: T2-w GRASE images may replace T2-w TSE for clinical use. However, even at 7T, both sequences fail in detecting and characterizing MS disease beyond visible WM-Ls. Copyright © 2015 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.",Excluded
821,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included
790,"Radiation exposure during cardiac catheterisation is similar for both femoral and radial approaches Objectives: Radial approach invasive coronary angiography has been shown to be superior to the femoral approach in terms of reducing vascular access complications and improving patient comfort. However, one major limitation has been the perception of higher patient radiation exposure, with guidelines recommending 7mSv as an appropriate average effective dose (E) for routine coronary angiography. Therefore, we sought here to assess differences in radiation exposure between the femoral and radial access routes in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography with or without angioplasty (CA +/- PCI), as performed by two operators, experienced in both techniques. Method(s): Consecutive patients (n. =. 870) from July 2011-December 2012, undergoing routine CA +/- PCI at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney by two experienced interventional cardiologists were identified. Radiation doses were automatically recorded as dose area products (DAPs) at procedure time and converted into E using a conversion factor of 0.18 mSv/(Gycm2), as validated by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). Result(s): Of the 870 patients, 598 underwent diagnostic CA (347 femoral, 251 radial); and 272 underwent CA+ PCI (179 femoral, 93 radial). The mean age of the patients was 65. +/-. 12 years and the majority (n. =. 617, 71%) were male. Both groups were well matched with respect to baseline demographics, clinical presentation and angiographic characteristics, though there was an excess of patients with a history of coronary grafts in the femoral group, due to operator preference. In the patients who underwent diagnostic CA, there was no significant difference in the average effective radiation dose for femoral versus radial arterial access (. E=. 7.9. +/-. 8.2 vs. 8.3. +/-. 10.6mSv; p. =. 0.66). Similarly, there was also no difference in average effective radiation dose for femoral versus radial arterial access in patients undergoing CA. +. PCI (. E=. 13.2. +/-. 8.1 vs E=. 14.4. +/-. 8.3 mSv; p. =. 0.26). Conclusion(s): In our high volume cardiac catheterisation laboratory, radiation doses for routine angiography were near UNSC targets. Patient radiation exposure was comparable between femoral and radial approaches, for both CA and CA +/- PCI. Thus, our results allay concerns that radial cardiac catheterisation might be associated with greater radiation exposure.Copyright © 2014 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ).",Excluded
1032,"Immune events associated with protection in C57BL/6 mice immunized with anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking protective antigens shared between gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model of Schistosoma haematobium Immunoregulation is central for successful manipulation of schistosomiasis. Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded
1142,"AN INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY INVESTIGATION: PATIENT EXPOSURE TO RADIATION AND INTER-OPERATOR VARIABILITY IN AN IRISH SETTING AIM: To evaluate patient radiation exposure for Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DCA) and Percutaneous Cardiac Intervention (PCI) performed by different operators. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective (n = 160) and prospective (n = 62) data for DCA (n = 179) and PCI (n = 43) examinations performed by interventional cardiologists (n = 3) using the same imaging equipment were reviewed. The operator with consistently low diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) was interviewed for their personal perceptions upon operator training. Retrospective Median [IQR] DAP was 18.8 [11.8-31.6] and 50.7 [35.3-85.6] Gy.cm2 for DCA and PCI, respectively. Prospective Median [IQR] DAP for DCA and PCI was 7.9 [5.2-10.6] and 15.9 [10.0-17.7] Gy.cm2, respectively. DRLs were within Irish and European DRLs; however, significant inter-operator variability (p < .001) was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Radiation exposure in Interventional cardiology is highly operator dependent; further research is warranted in standardization of operator training with evolving technologies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Thirty-two patients with rectal adenocarcinomas were preoperatively treated with 44 to 46 Gy in 22 to 23 fractions and with 5-fluorouracil (200 to 225 mg/m) before surgery. Mucoid differentiation was searched for both in pre-RCT biopsies with anti-MUC2 antiserum and in postoperative specimens. To evaluate the responsiveness to preoperative RCT, a regression grading was used (grades 0 to 4). Statistical analysis showed a significant negative correlation between immunohistochemical expression of MUC2 in pre-RCT biopsies and regression grade in postoperative specimens (r=-0.529; P=0.002).

515,"Life on mars from a Self-Determination Theory perspective: How astronauts' needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness go hand in hand with crew health and mission success - Results from HI-SEAS IV With the advent of long-duration interplanetary space missions, astronauts face new psychological challenges never observed before. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, the objective of the present research was to study how astronauts' basic psychological needs relate to astronaut well-being and mission success, and how Mission Support could foster astronaut need satisfaction. Specifically, we examined how weekly ups and downs in astronauts' need for autonomy, competence and relatedness related to week-to-week fluctuations in a set of positive (i.e., self-endorsed motivation to follow operating procedures, cooperation with Mission Support members, happiness and performance) and negative outcomes (i.e., oppositional defiance towards operating procedures, irritation with Mission Support members and stress) during the Mars simulation HI-SEAS mission 4. Additionally, we examined whether variations in astronauts' needs could be predicted by variations in Mission Support's communication style in interacting with the crew. The study comprised six volunteers, three women and three men, between 25 and 36 years of age (M = 30, SD = 4). The HI-SEAS IV mission simulated a yearlong stay on Mars. During the simulation, measures of autonomy, competence, relatedness with crewmembers and loved-ones at home, well-being, motivation, crew-ground interactions and performance were taken on a weekly basis. The data were analyzed using multilevel analyses. Overall, results indicated significant decreases in the experiences of autonomy as well as relatedness with both crewmembers and loved-ones at home, which aggravated as the mission progressed. Weekly experiences of all three need satisfactions, but in particular autonomy and relatedness with fellow crewmembers, were found to relate positively to weekly variations in self-endorsed motivation, cooperation, happiness and performance, and negatively to weekly variations in oppositional defiance, irritation, and stress. Moreover, week-to-week fluctuations in an autonomy-supportive communication style from Mission Support were found to relate positively, and a controlling style negatively, to weekly fluctuations in the crew's experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness with crewmembers. Implications for future studies and human spaceflight are discussed. 2019 IAA",Excluded
981,"Reducing radiation exposure during invasive coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions implementing a simple four-step protocol Background: With an increasing number of complex and repeated percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), radiation-induced hazards for patients and operators remain an important issue in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Our objective was to evaluate radiation exposure during coronary angiographic procedures and assess the efficacy of a four-step program to reduce radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CAG) and PCI. Methods and Results: A retrospective single-center analysis was performed in patients undergoing CAG or PCI in the first 6 months of 2012 vs. the first 6 months of 2014 (n = 3,107 procedures). During 2013, a four-step protocol was established in our hospital. It contained measures to reduce radiation exposure, including a frame rate reduction from 15 to 7.5 frames per second, the use of fluoroscopy storage, strict use of beam collimation, and repeat training on radiation safety. After adjustment for confounding variables, a dose-area product (DAP) reduction of 54.2 % was observed subsequent to implementation of the four-step protocol. Independent predictors of DAP were age [odds ratio (OR) 1.01], body surface area (OR 5.47), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.44), radial access (OR 1.16), PCI (OR 2.36), female gender (OR 0.91), and the implementation of the four-step program (OR 0.46). Conclusion(s): A simple four-step protocol led to a significant reduction in radiation exposure in diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures without significant drawbacks in image quality. Hence, radiation safety programs are of paramount importance and should be established to improve patient and operator safety with regard to radiation-induced hazards.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
707,"Radiation dose of fluoroscopic vs computer-assisted pedicle screw insertion There is a rapid increase of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) in the spine for insertion of pedicle screws. In contrast to the traditional technique using fluoroscopy, CT is the primary source for surgical navigation systems. Purpose of the study: to compare organ and effective doses of fluoroscopy-controlled versus computer-assisted pedicle screw insertion under the aspect of risk reduction and number needed to treat. Material(s) and Method(s): in 20 consecutive cases of traditional pedicle screw instrumentation under fluoroscopic control the effective doses were recorded in vivo and the organ doses then calculated. Simulating a spiral CT necessary for the 3-D-model for navigation we defined a spiral CT protocol for the instrumented levels and calculated organ and effective doses from Monte Carlo Results from CT examinations. Result(s): Organ doses were clearly higher for the CT model than in any of the fluoroscopic procedures in vivo. The mean effective dose for the CT model was fifteen times higher than the fluoroscopic dose: 7.27 mSv versus 0.48 mSv. Conclusion(s): in experienced hands open pedicle screw insertion in the thoracic and lumbar spine using fluoroscopy-control requires a fifteen times lower radiation dose than do CT scans necessary for computer-assisted surgery. Regarding the published small percentage of neurological complications in traditional screw insertion technique the use of computer-assisted surgery in pedicle screw insertion using CT scan should be limited to carefully chosen indications. The development of navigation systems based on other data sources than CT should be encouraged. © Springer-Verlag 2002.",Excluded
206,"Availability, requesting practices, and barriers to referral for high-resolution CT of the lungs: Results of a survey of U.S. pulmonologists Rationale and Objectives. The authors performed this study to assess the availability of high-resolution computed tomography (CT), current referral practices, and potential barriers to the clinical use of high-resolution CT in patients with diffuse lung disease. Materials and Methods. The authors sent a survey to 450 pulmonologists who were members of the American College of Chest Physicians. They sought information about the availability of high-resolution CT services, explored the physicians' current requesting practices and the monthly number of referrals, and assessed the influence of six factors on the decision to refer. Results. The authors received completed surveys from 230 pulmonologists (52.6%). High-resolution CT services were available to all respondents and had been used by 226 (98.3%) of them during the preceding 12 months. Two-thirds of respondents referred one to four patients per month, and one-third referred five or more. Monthly referral volume did not significantly vary among different practice types. The pulmonologists expressed a preference for hospital-based imaging facilities and routinely reviewed the images from the examinations they ordered. The most frequent reason for high-resolution CT was classification of a known interstitial process. High-resolution CT was infrequently requested to evaluate symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Confidence in the radiologist's high-resolution CT interpretation was the most important factor influencing the referral decision, and radiation dose to the patient was the least important. Conclusion. High-resolution CT services are widely available to and frequently requested by U.S. pulmonologists in a variety of practice settings. High-resolution CT may be underutilized in symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Radiologists should be aware that the perception of their skill in high-resolution CT interpretation is an important determinant in the pulmonologist's decision to refer.",Excluded

The patients received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. For each patient the 3D dose distribution delivered to the upper 5 cm of the oesophagus was analysed. The analysis was conducted for two periods, 1992-2000 and 2001-2005, due to the different irradiation techniques used. The fitting has been done using the relative seriality model., RESULTS: For the treatment period 1992-2005, the mean doses were 49.8 and 33.4 Gy, respectively, for the cases and the controls. For the period 1992-2000, the mean doses for the cases and the controls were 49.9 and 45.9 Gy and for the period 2001-2005 were 49.8 and 21.4 Gy. For the period 2001-2005 the best estimates of the dose-response parameters are D(50)=61.5 Gy (52.9-84.9 Gy), gamma=1.4 (0.8-2.6) and s=0.1 (0.01-0.3)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced strictures were found to have a dose response relation and volume dependence (low relative seriality) for the treatment period 2001-2005.

204,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

1209,"Definitive Management of Presumed Synchronous Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers: Outcomes and Utility of Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy Purpose: Management of synchronous early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial because resection is not always feasible. This study evaluates efficacy and patterns of failure after SABR for synchronous early-stage NSCLC. Methods and Materials: From 2005 to 2015, patients presenting with >=2 synchronous NSCLC tumors (T1a-T2b) and receiving SABR to >=1 lesion were reviewed. The most common prescriptions were 50 Gy in 4 or 70 Gy in 10 fractions. Patients underwent multidisciplinary management with workup including chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, plus brain imaging and endoscopic bronchial ultrasound for most patients to rule out mediastinal and distant disease. Synchronous lesions were defined as multiple ipsilateral or contralateral intrapulmonary lesions diagnosed within 6 months. Result(s): Of 912 patients treated with SABR for early-stage NSCLC at our institution, 82 (9%) presented with synchronous disease, with a total of 169 lesions. SABR was delivered to 142 lesions (84%), with 57 patients (69.5%) receiving SABR for all sites. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 5.1 and 2.7 years, respectively. At a median follow-up of 58 months, OS was 67% and 52% at 3 and 5 years, and corresponding PFS was 47% and 29%. Thirty-nine patients (48%) had progression, with 21 (26%) experiencing distant failure, and intralobar recurrence was among the first failure for 15 patients (18%). Of the 142 SABR-treated sites, these included 6 in-field (4%) and 4 marginal (3%) recurrences. There were no grade >=3 adverse events. Among patients receiving SABR for all sites, there were no differences in OS (P = .946), PFS (P = .980), local control (P = .683), regional and distant control (P = .656), or toxicity (P = .791). On multivariable analysis, ipsilateral synchronous disease was associated with greater regional and distant failure (hazard ratio, 2.691; P = .025). Conclusion(s): Synchronous NSCLC can be managed with definitive local therapy. With high control rates and favorable outcomes, SABR is an effective and feasible treatment for synchronous early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We irradiated samples from four healthy Korean individuals and compared the resultant curves between individuals. Aberration yields were studied in a total of 31,800 and 31,725 metaphases for DC and TR, respectively, obtained from 11 X-ray irradiation dose-points (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Gy).

658,"Radiation-related arterial disease Arterial occlusive disease has been recognized in association with radiation arteriopathy and, rarely, with spontaneous arterial disruption. This association results from the greater role of radiation therapy in the current management of malignant diseases coupled with longer patient survival and the lengthy latency period between radiation and clinical manifestations of radiation arteriopathy. Experience with six patients having radiation-associated arterial disease was retrospectively reviewed. There were four men and two women, with a mean age of 51 years (range, 36-74). Arteries exposed to radiation include two carotids, three subclavians, one coronary, and one femoral. The time from radiation therapy until clinical arterial disease was a mean of 14.3 years (range, 4-30). Operative repairs with polytetrafluoroethylene and saphenous vein bypass grafts were performed in four patients, stent placement in one patient, and one patient had spontaneous carotid disruption that ultimately was treated with ligation. In conclusion, elective bypass can be performed safely and successfully for arterial occlusive disease in a previously irradiated artery. In contrast, life-threatening arterial disruption secondary to radiation arteriopathy usually requires concomitant exposure to a source of bacterial contamination, and ligation may be the best choice to prevent recurrent hemorrhage.",Excluded
1009,"Irradiated homologous rib grafts in nasal reconstruction OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy of irradiated homologous rib grafts (IHRGs) for both augmentation and support function in rhinoplasty in general and for specific recipient sites within the nose. DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted at an academic medical center to evaluate the loss of volume and support function of IHRGs in 9 specific recipient sites in the nose. RESULT(S): We studied 66 patients, with a total of 177 IHRGs, dating back 9 years, with an average follow-up of 51 months. The rate of resorption increased with duration of follow-up. Complete resorption was found in 1 IHRG, and moderate resorption was observed in 55 IHRGs (31%). Resorption was characterized by a loss of support function rather than a loss of volume. Moderate resorption had a negative clinical outcome for shield grafts only. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated homologous rib grafts were safe to use in rhinoplasty. In cases requiring a shield graft, IHRGs should be avoided.",Excluded

The activity values in the liver, spleen, and kidneys were calculated from the 2D WB scans, and also from the 3D SPECT images reconstructed, using quantitative image processing. Absorbed doses after the administration of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan were calculated from the (111)In WB activity values combined with reference organ masses and also from the SPECT activity values and organ masses as estimated from the patient CT scan. To assess the quantitative accuracy of the WB and SPECT scans, an abdominal phantom was also studied., RESULTS: The differences between organ masses estimated from the patient CT and from the reference MIRD models were between -10% and +98%. Using the phantom, errors in organ and tumor activity estimates were between -86% and 10% for the WB protocol and between -43% and -6% for the SPECT protocol. Patient liver, spleen, and kidney activity values determined from SPECT were systematically less than those from the WB scans. Radiation-absorbed doses calculated with the 3D protocol were systematically lower than those calculated from the WB protocol (29%+/-26%, 73%+/-26%, and 33%+/-53% differences in the liver, spleen, and kidney, respectively), except in the kidneys of 2 patients and in the liver of 1 patient., CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for patient-specific organ mass and using SPECT activity quantification have both a great impact on estimated absorbed doses.",Excluded
187,"Randomized phase III study of 2 cisplatin-based chemoradiation regimens in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Impact of changing disease epidemiology on contemporary trial design Background Chemoradiotherapy results in excellent outcomes in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This trial compared 2 chemoradiotherapy regimens. Methods Patients with locally advanced HNSCC were treated with radiation (70-74.4 Gy), and randomized to arm A: cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on radiotherapy (RT) days 1, 22, and 43, or arm B: cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 1000 mg/m2/day) continuous 96-hour infusions on RT weeks 1 and 4. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). Results Between February 2008 and October 2011, 69 patients were enrolled in this study. The study prematurely closed when a scheduled interim analysis showed superior outcomes in both arms and futility of continuation. Eighty-three percent of patients had oropharyngeal cancer, of these, 86% were human papillomavirus (HPV)/p16+. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier outcome estimates (median follow-up, 41 months) for arms A and B were: RFS 87% versus 80% (p=.24), overall survival 97% versus 85% (p=.013), locoregional control 96% versus 94% (p=.52), and distant metastatic control 91% versus 87% (p=.9). Conclusion Multiagent was not superior to single-agent chemoradiotherapy.

474,"Functional MR urography for assessment of obstructive and reflux uropathies Purpose - Objective. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU. The CHOP-fMRU examination protocol is very robust and reliable and able to give as much information as MAG3 scintigraphy. It is now possible to receive information on morphology, excretion, and split renal function with one examination.",Excluded
1242,"Radiation therapy in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.",Included

There were 19 men and 18 women with a mean age of 67.6+/-11.7 (SD) years (range: 36-85 years) For each patient, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated at each anatomic level (lung, breast, liver and pelvis area) for each protocol. Two radiologists assessed independently image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence., RESULTS: The radiation dose decreased significantly using Liver DRI compared to standard automatic exposure control on the total scan length, lung, breast and pelvis area, with a significant CTDIvol reduction of 27% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002), 24% (P=0.0002) and 31% (P=0.0001), respectively; and a significant SSDE reduction of 23% (P=0.0001), 28% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002) and 29% (P=0.0001), respectively. No significant SNR reductions were observed in all measured tissues at the level of the aortic arch, celiac trunk and iliac bifurcation, except in the muscle (P=0.0013) and fat tissue (P=0.0052) at the level of the ureteral meatus. No significant differences were noted between both protocols in overall image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence with an excellent inter observer agreement between radiologists (Kappa values of 0.83, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Liver DRI organ based dose modulation technique allows significant dose reduction compared to standard automatic exposure control while preserving diagnostic image quality in all thoraco-abdominopelvic areas.

76,"Instrument for near infrared emission spectroscopic probing of human fingertips in vivo We present instrumentation for probing of volar side fingertip capillary beds with free space coupled near infrared light while collecting Raman, Rayleigh, and Mie scattered light as well as fluorescence. Fingertip skin capillary beds are highly vascularized relative to other tissues and present a desirable target for noninvasive probing of blood. But human hands and fingers in particular are also highly idiosyncratic body parts requiring specific apparatus to allow careful and methodical spectroscopic probing. The apparatus includes means for precise and reproducible placement of the tissues relative to the optical aperture. Appropriate means are provided for applying and maintaining pressure to keep surface tissues immobile during experiments while obtaining the desired blood content and flow. Soft matter, e.g., skin, extrudes into the aperture in response to any applied pressure, e.g., to keep the tissue in registration with the optical system, so the position, contact area, pressure, and force are continuously measured and recorded to produce feedback for an actuator applying force and to discern the compliance of the test subject. The compliance strongly affects the reliability of the measurement and human factors must be adequately managed in the case of in vivo probing. The apparatus produces reproducible observations and measurements that allow consistent probing of the tissues of a wide range of skin types.",Excluded
223,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
210,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome. Second-look surgery and resection of residual/ refractory tumors is always recommended.",Excluded
439,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
368,"The relationship between tumor volume changes and serial plasma osteopontin detection during radical radiotherapy of non-small-cell lung cancer The prognostic quality of increased osteopontin (OPN) plasma levels has been demonstrated for the chemotherapy and surgery of lung cancer. There is also evidence in the literature that tumor volume impacts prognosis in definitive radiotherapy (RT) of (lung) cancer. We previously demonstrated that elevated plasma levels of OPN before, and increasing OPN plasma levels after RT significantly correlate with survival and outcome after curative-intent RT of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumor volume was also associated with prognosis. The present prospective clinical study investigated the prognostic interrelation of OPN plasma levels and tumor volume and their changes in the radical RT of NSCLC. We evaluated a subset of patients (n=27) with inoperable, non-metastasized NSCLC of the previously published patient collective. Patients were treated with radical radiochemotherapy (2 Gy ad 66 Gy). OPN plasma concentrations were determined by ELISA before (t0), at the end (t1), and 4 weeks after RT (t2). GTV was delineated PET- and CT-correlated before RT (GTV1) and after 40 Gy (GTV2). The course of OPN during and after RT and the change of GTV during RT was monitored over time and correlated with prognosis. Median GTV2 after 40 Gy (63 ml) was significantly lower than pre-RT GTV1 (90 ml, P<0.0001). Median OPN before (t0), at the end of (t1) and four weeks after RT (t2) was 846, 777 and 624 ng/ml and not significantly different. GTV significantly declined by 39 ml during RT (P<0.0001) and OPN non-significantly decreased by 56 ng/ml during (t0 to t1) and by 54 ng/ml after RT (t1 to t2). No correlations were determined between absolute OPN and GTV values or their relative changes during RT. In univariate analysis, only GTV2 significantly predicted overall survival (OS, P=0.03). In multivariate analysis, both OPN t1 (P<0.001) and GTV2 (P=0.001) remained significant predictors of OS. Relative OPN plasma level changes after (t1 to t2) and GTV changes during RT (GTV 1 to GTV 2) significantly predicted OS (P=0.02). The combination of absolute GTV values before RT (GTV1) and GTV changes during RT (GTV1 to 2) were significantly associated with OS in both uni- and multivariate analysis (P=0.03). The combination of absolute OPN plasma levels and their changes with GTV and its changes did not reach statistical significance. The lack of a significant correlation between OPN and GTV together with the finding that OPN and GTV remained independent predictors of survival outcome but were not associated with OS in combination supports the hypothesis that tumor volume (GTV) and OPN plasma levels (both their changes and absolute values) are not interrelated in terms of prognosis but do possess each parameter separately, a prognostic quality in the radical RT of NSCLC which justifies further prospective studies to validate these results.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

780,"The pattern and time course of somatosensory changes in the human UVB sunburn model reveal the presence of peripheral and central sensitization The ultraviolet B (UVB) sunburn model was characterized with a comprehensive battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST). Primary hyperalgesia in UVB-irradiated skin and secondary hyperalgesia in adjacent nonirradiated skin were studied in 22 healthy subjects 24h after irradiation with UVB at 3-fold minimal erythema dose of a skin area 5 cm in diameter at the thigh and compared to mirror-image contralateral control areas. The time course of hyperalgesia over 96 h was studied in a subgroup of 12 subjects. Within the sunburn area, cold hyperesthesia (P=.01), profound generalized hyperalgesia to heat (P<.001), cold (P<.05), pinprick and pressure (P<.001), and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia (P<.001) were present. The finding of cold hyperalgesia and cold hyperesthesia is new in this model. The sunburn was surrounded by large areas of pinprick hyperalgesia (mean+/-SEM, 218+/-32 cm(2)) and a small rim of dynamic mechanical allodynia but no other sensory changes. Although of smaller magnitude, secondary hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia adjacent to the UVB-irradiated area were statistically highly significant. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia developed in parallel within hours, peaked after 24-32 h, and lasted for more than 96 h. These data reveal that the UVB sunburn model activates a broad spectrum of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms and hence is a useful human surrogate model to be used as a screening tool for target engagement in phases 1 and 2a of drug development.

Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included

300,"Estimation of radiation exposure of retrospective gated and prospective triggered 128-slice triple-rule-out CT angiography CT has become an important role in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain to exclude an aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism and acute coronary artery syndrome. However, the additional radiation exposure is a cause of concern and dose saving strategies should be applied, if possible. To estimate effective dose of retrospective gated and prospective ECG-triggered triple-rule-out computed tomography angiography (TRO-CTA). An Alderson-Rando-phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used for dose measurements. Exposure was performed on a 128-slice single source scanner. The following scan parameters were used (retrospective ECG-gated): 120 kV, 190 mAs/rot., collimation 128x0.6 mm, rotation time 0.3 s. Protocols with a simulated heart rate (HR) of 60 and 100 bpm were performed using the standard ECG-pulsing as well as MinDose. Additionally, a prospective triggered TRO-CTA was acquired (HR 60 bpm). The estimated effective dose of retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA ranged from 7.4-13.4 mSv and from 10.1-17.5 mSv for men and women, respectively. Due to radiosensitive breast tissue, women received a significant increased effective dose of up to 64.7% +/- 0.03% (p = 0.028) compared to men. MinDose reduces radiation exposure of up to 33.0% +/- 6.5% in comparison to standard ECG-pulsing (p < 0.001). The effective dose increased significantly with lower heart rates (p < 0.001). Prospective ECG-triggered TRO-CTA showed an effective dose of 5.9 mSv and 8.2 mSv for men and women, respectively. Compared to retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA a significant dose reduction was observed (p < 0.001). Due to the significant different dose exposure, scan protocols should be specifically adapted in a patient- and problem-oriented manner.",Excluded
214,"A case-control study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the high background radiation areas of Yangjiang, China The main purposes of this study were to identify the major determinants of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the high-background radiation areas (HBRA) in Yangjiang, China and to evaluate their potential confounding effects on the NPC risk associated with exposure to high background radiation. A matched case-control study was conducted using those who died of NPC during the period 1987-1995. Two controls were randomly selected for each case from those who died from causes other than malignancies and external causes. Cases and their controls were matched with respect to sex and the years of birth and death (+/- 5 years). Study subjects' next-of-kin were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on socioeconomic status, dietary habits, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, disease history, pesticide use, medical X-ray exposure, the family history of NPC and so on. We succeeded in interviewing 97 cases and 192 controls. Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NPC risk was associated with the consumption of salted fish, homemade pickles, and fermented soy beans, education levels, the history of chronic rhinitis, and the family history of NPC. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that education levels (Odds ratio (OR) for middle school or higher levels vs. no school education = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.8), salted fish intake (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.1), the history of chronic rhinitis (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 10.1), and the family history of NPC (OR = 14.2, 95% CI = 2.7 to 73.4) were independent risk factors of NPC. Tobacco smoking (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7 to 2.1), and alcohol consumption (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5 to 1.9) were not significantly related to NPC risk. The ORs of NPC risk comparing HBRA and a nearby control area before and after adjustment for the major risk determinants identified in the present study were 0.86 (95% CI = 0.50 to 1.50) and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.45 to 1.67), respectively. Salted fish intake was a strong risk factor of NPC. Education, the history of chronic rhinitis and the family history of NPC were also related to NPC risk. The exposure to high background radiation in HBRA of Yangjiang was not related to NPC risk with or without the adjustment for those major risk determinants of NPC.",Excluded
209,"Asymmetric collimation can significantly reduce patient radiation dose during pulmonary vein isolation AIMS: Current fluoroscopic and 3D image-guided treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) by radiofrequency ablation is characterized by a substantial amount of X-ray radiation. We investigated the potential of an asymmetric collimation technique to reduce dose., METHODS AND RESULTS: For 30 patients, referred for AF ablation, we determined the received fluoroscopy dose for various collimation scenarios: a single collimation window encompassing all veins as used in most labs (Sc 1), an optimal adjusted symmetric collimation window encompassing each two ipsilateral veins (Sc 2) or each individual vein (Sc 3) and an optimal asymmetric collimation window encompassing each two ipsilateral veins (Sc 4) or each individual vein (Sc 5). Twenty patients were studied retrospectively and 10 were studied prospectively. Total fluoroscopy effective dose for all collimation strategies amounted to 45 +/- 31 mSv for a single collimation field (Sc 1), 36 +/- 25 mSv (Sc 2), and 24 +/- 14 mSv (Sc 3) for a symmetrically adjusted collimation window and 15 +/- 10 (Sc 4) and 5 +/- 3 mSv (Sc 5) for an asymmetrically adjusted collimation approach. Validation of symmetric (Sc 2) and asymmetric (Sc 4) collimation in 10 patients confirmed the retrospective analysis., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation and effective application of an optimal asymmetric collimation approach would yield an average three- to nine-fold reduction of fluoroscopy dose during AF ablation procedures. This reduction exceeds what has been previously reported by implementing an electromagnetic catheter tracking approach. Furthermore, it can be easily integrated in the clinical workflow with limited additional one-time cost. Manufacturers of imaging systems should consider its implementation a priority, and physicians should adopt it in their workflow.",Excluded

This phase II study tested the addition of the oral epidermal growth factor receptor gefitinib to multiagent concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Methods. Patients with stage III-IV HNSCC received hyperfractionated radiation (72-74.4 Gy at 120 cGy twice daily), with concurrent 96-hour infusions of cisplatin 20 mg/m 2/day and fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day given during weeks 1 and 4. Daily gefitinib 250 mg was started on day 1 of radiation and continued for 2 years. Results. were retrospectively compared with our previous study using identical chemoradiotherapy without gefitinib. Results. Sixty patients were enrolled in the study; 80% had stage IV disease and 68% had oropharyngeal primary tumors. The full course of gefitinib was not tolerated by 42%; there were 5 treatment-related deaths (8%). With a median follow-up of 54 months, 2- and 3-year overall survival estimates were 80% and 71%, respectively. Projected distant metastatic control at 2 and 3 years was 88%. When compared with our historical cohort, acute toxicities including renal dysfunction and unplanned rehospitalization were worse in the study patients. Projected outcome estimates did not differ between the 2 cohorts. Conclusions. Addition of gefitinib to concurrent chemoradiotherapy was difficult to complete, did not improve outcomes, and increased toxicity. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Method(s): There were 25 patients-22 (88%) men and 3 (12%) women (60+/-13 years) with decompensated CHF recruited for the study. All patients underwent following examinations: medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (repeated on the lung function tests day), 12-leads electrocardiogram, X-ray, echocardiogram. The spirometry and body plethysmography were performed after patient's clinical haemodynamic stabilization. The following lung function tests parameters were taken into analysis: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), Tiffeneau ratio -FEV1 %VCmax (Maximal Vital Capacity), total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), total airway resistance (Rtot). All examinations were repeated 3 months after the discharge. The median follow-up was 61 months. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, chi2 test and Pearson correlation were used for the initial statistical analysis. Result(s): The ejection fraction (EF) <=35% (21,1%+/-7,42) was confirmed in all patients on admission and 3 months after the discharge (23,3+/-8%, p=0,05). The elevated BNP level (2131,3+/-1096,8 pg/ml) was revealed in all patients on admission. Both BNP levels after stabilization (1192,4+/-1070,8 pg/ml) and 3 months after the discharge (745,7+/-635pg/ml) were lower than initial (p<0,0001). The spirometry revealed obstructive disorders in 20 patients (80%) at the discharge and 3 months later. The body plethysmography confirmed restrictive disorders in 2 patients (8%) at the discharge. We revealed the significant correlations between FEV1%VCmax and the highest BNP level (r=-0,45, p=0,027 ) and BNP level on lung function tests day (r=-0,44, p=0,03). We also found negative relationships between: EF and FEV1 (r=-0,41, p=0,04), EF and TLC (r=-0,59, p=0,007), EF and FEV1 measured 3 months after the discharge (r=-0,45, p=0,04).

Whole-body and plasma clearance, normal-organ and lesion uptake, and radiation absorbed dose were estimated. We also preliminarily tested the performance of 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging for 13 patients with prostate cancer and 4 patients with other urological cancer., RESULTS: The administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated, and no infusion-related reactions were observed in any patient. No adverse events were noted in the laboratory parameters, vital signs, or other parameters. The plasma clearance was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 fast: 10.1 +/- 3.4 h) followed by a slow phase (t 1/2 slow: 49.0 +/- 22.7 h). The half-life of radioactivity in the whole body (WB t1/2) was 237 +/- 9 h. The highest absorbed radiation dose was 1.67 mGy/MBq, observed in the liver and kidney. The effective dose was 0.68 +/- 0.08 mSv/MBq. The radiation dose rate at 0.5 m distance from the patient was 8.67 microSv/h on day 1, and decreased to 2.26 microSv/h at 5 days after injection. Both bone and lymph node metastases were detected with 89Zr-Df-IAB2M by 24 or 48 h imaging., CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated and safe in terms of adverse events and radiation exposure and protection. 89Zr-Df-IAB2M is feasible for usage by long-distance transportation.

The acquisition length in limited CTPA in this population was reduced on average by 21.9% compared with full CTPA., CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with acute PTE, there were none whose PTE was located solely in the upper lobes which were higher than the aortic arch, nor solely in the lower lobes which were lower than the heart. A limited range triple rule-out CTA protocol would decrease effective doses approximately 22% relative to full chest CTA and may help the physician find all PE present.

FLS was induced using the filter Black ProMist 2 to simulate an early cataract. Blur was induced using a +1.00 diopter lens to simulate an uncorrected refractive error., RESULTS: Similar significant mean increases in halo radius were observed for the FLS (0.32 +/- 0.10 log arc min; P < .0001) and refractive blur (0.40 +/- 0.18 log arc min; P < .0001). Under induced blur, 3 lines of HCVA (0.32 +/- 0.15 logMAR; P < .0001) and 4 lines of LCVA (0.39 +/- 0.16 logMAR; P < .0001) were lost. FLS had a minimal (but significant) effect on HCVA, but worsened mean LCVA by more than 1 line (0.13 +/- 0.10 logMAR; P < .0001). Similar significant mean CS reductions of 0.17 +/- 0.12 (P < .0001) and 0.14 +/- 0.12 log units (P < .0001) were produced in response to FLS and refractive blur, respectively (approximately 1 triplet)., CONCLUSIONS: Forward light scatter and refractive blur contributed to an increased size of the disk halo produced by a glare source in similar proportion. Although defocus blur has a substantial effect on LCVA, a loss of more than 1 line of LCVA after best refractive correction would be indicative of FLS.",Excluded
662,"Evidence that ferritin is UV inducible in human skin: part of a putative defense mechanism As ferritin has been identified as an important factor in antioxidant defense in cultured human skin cells we evaluated the presence of ferritin in human skin in vivo and the modifications following irradiation with UVA I, UVA I + II, and solar simulating light by immunohistochemical analysis. We report that the putative protective protein ferritin is regularly present in the basal layer of unirradiated epidermis in vivo and that the induction of ferritin was dependent on wavelength and cell type. Following UVA I radiation, ferritin increased both in epidermal and in dermal tissue. The same response occurred, although to a lesser extent, with UVA I + II but did not occur following solar simulating radiation. Quantitative analysis for ferritin in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts from seven individuals following each UV spectra were also assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The induction of ferritin by UV was highly dependent on the waveband and cell type. UVA I and UVA I + II radiations induced ferritin expression in dermal fibroblasts up to 260% and 200% over basal levels, respectively. Solar simulating radiation produced only a small induction of approximately 130% over basal ferritin levels in dermal fibroblasts. Ferritin increased in cultured fibroblasts as early as 3 h post-UVA with a peak at 6 h that remained until 48 h; there was no observable qualitative or quantitative increase seen in the undifferentiated cultured epidermal keratinocytes. Our findings indicate that the putative defense system of ferritin exists in human skin in vivo and its induction is dependent on UV spectra and cell type. The increased concentrations of this antioxidant in human skin following acute UV radiation could afford increased protection against subsequent oxidative stress.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: A survey of 36 questions was designed to collect information regarding practice patterns of radiation oncologists for the management of patients with NSCLC. All American Society for Radiation Oncology members were invited to respond. Result(s): Four hundred twenty-four responses from radiation oncologists in the United States were received. The response rate for the survey was approximately 20%. Substantial discrepancies were seen in the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for patients with peripherally and centrally located early-stage tumors and in the recommended SBRT dose. There was a near consensus opinion regarding the use of concurrent chemotherapy and the radiation dose for patients with inoperable stage II and III NSCLC with a good performance status; however, in patients with a poor performance status or in patients with stage IV disease treatment recommendations differed remarkably. Additionally, the use of elective nodal irradiation and the assessment of tumor motion during simulation were highly variable. Thoracic radiation oncologists were more likely to prescribe higher doses, omit elective nodal irradiation, and use advanced technologies (P < .001). Conclusion(s): Substantial variations were seen in the management of patients with stage I and IV NSCLC in addition to the incorporation of new technology.

775,"Kidney-sparing radiotherapy by multiple-field three-dimensional technique in the postoperative management of patients with gastric cancer: Comparison with standard two-field conformal technique Aims and background: The opposed two-field technique is the standard approach for delivering adjuvant radiotherapy to patients with resected gastric cancer. Since a considerable radiation dose may reach both kidneys with this beam arrangement, with a potential risk of late effects, we investigated whether the CT-based multiple-field (M-F) approach was superior in terms of sparing critical organs at risk. Method(s): From March 2001 to March 2004, 19 patients with radically resected gastric cancer entered the study. They were treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy according to the INT 0116 protocol. For each patient dose-volume histograms were calculated and the volume values of both kidneys and liver receiving 25 Gy (V25), 30 Gy (V30) and 40 Gy (V40) individually estimated with the M-F and two-field techniques were compared in detail.

213,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
122,"Synthesis of D-mannose capped silicon nanoparticles and their interactions with MCF-7 human breast cancerous cells Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) hold prominent interest in various aspects of biomedical applications. For this purpose, surface functionalization of the NPs is essential to stabilize them, target them to specific disease area, and allow them to selectively bind to the cells or the bio-molecules present on the surface of the cells. However, no such functionalization has been explored with Si nanoparticles. Carbohydrates play a critical role in cell recognition. Here, we report the first synthesis of silicon nanoparticles functionalized with carbohydrates. In this study, stable and brightly luminescent d-Mannose (Man) capped SiNPs have been synthesized from amine terminated SiNPs and d-mannopyranoside acid. The surface functionalization is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies. The mean diameter of the crystal core is 5.5 nm, as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the hydrodynamic diameter obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) is 16 nm. The quantum yield (QY) of photoluminescence emission is found to be 11.5%, and the nanoparticles exhibit an exceptional stability over two weeks. The Man-capped SiNPs may prove to be valuable tools for further investigating glycobiological, biomedical, and material science fields. Experiments are carried out using Concanavalin A (ConA) as a target protein in order to prove the hypothesis. When Man functionalized SiNPs are treated with ConA, cross-linked aggregates are formed, as shown in TEM images as well as monitored by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Man functionalized SiNPs can target cancerous cells.

The experimental group (30 patients) was treated with ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" during the full course of radiotherapy, 4 times daily with 5 mL and 5 min each time. The control group (30 patients) rinsed the mouth in the same way with normal saline. Oral mucositis was assessed according to the RTOG criteria. The severity of mucositis and the degree of pain were recorded and photographed. Patients shouldn't be treated with other drugs until the level of oral mucositis reached above grade III. The results were statistically analyzed using Stata 12.0 software packages., RESULTS: Age, gender, radiotherapy techniques and dose showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The first onset of oral mucositis in the experimental group was later than that in the control group (11.0 times:9.1 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of pain at the early time of radiotherapy was lower (36.7%: 70.0%, P<0.05).

Twenty-nine patients (68-93 years; 38-79 kg) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 12-49 ml/min underwent 80 kVp MDCT at a median dose of 200 mg iodine (I)/kg and 15 s injection time. Pulmonary artery (PA) enhancement where compared with our own reference material using 320 mg I/kg at 120 kVp and with reported figures in the literature at 120-140 kVp and a 42 g iodine CM dose. Median (1st and 3rd quartiles) values regarding CM dose were 12.2 (9.9-12.8) g iodine; density of left main and lower lobe segmental PA 339 (275-395) Hounsfield units (HU) and 354 (321-442) HU, respectively. Those enhancement values were similar to those obtained from the reference population at 120 kVp and those reported in the literature at 120-140 kVp. One patient had a transient increase in plasma creatinine. Three months' follow-up revealed deep venous thrombosis among 1/18 patients with negative results from computed tomography (CT). We conclude that 80 kVp 16-channel MDCT to diagnose PE in azotaemic patients may be performed with markedly reduced CM doses, implying a lesser risk for CM-induced nephropathy.",Excluded
792,"Radiosurgery for lung metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiosurgery (HFSR) is a noninvasive focused beam technique that delivers high-dose radiation. Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery for metastatic RCC to the lung offers a generally well-tolerated, noninvasive treatment method with a high rate of tumor control. Patients will continue to be evaluated for longer follow-up, possible benefits of metastatic cancer treatment and survival advantage. HFSR remains an option for those whom standard approaches have not produced desired results or in patients seeking an alternative to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment.",Excluded
161,"Randomized phase II study of temozolomide and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme Purpose: Surgery remains the standard treatment for glioma, followed by radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy. Despite multidisciplinary approaches, the median survival time for patients with glioblastoma multiform (GBM) remains at less than 1 year from initial diagnosis. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, has shown promising activity in the treatment of malignant gliomas. We conducted a multicenter randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of TMZ administered concomitantly and sequentially to RT versus RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Patients and Methods: One hundred thirty patients with pathologically confirmed, newly diagnosed GBM were randomly assigned (110 assessable patients) to receive either TMZ 75 mg/m2/d orally, concomitantly with RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group A, n = 57), followed by six cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5 and 15 to 19 every 28 days), or RT alone (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group B, n = 53). Result(s): Median time to progression was 10.8 months in group A and 5.2 months in group B (P = .0001). One-year progression-free survival rate was 36.6% in group A and 7.7% in group B. Median overall survival (OS) time was also significantly better in group A versus group B (13.4 v 7.7 months, respectively; P < .0001), as was the 1-year OS at 56.3% v 15.7% (P < .0001), respectively. Toxicity was mainly hematologic. One patient with grade 4 myelotoxicity died as a result of sepsis. The other side effects were mild. Conclusion(s): TMZ combined with RT (concomitantly and sequentially) seems to be more effective than RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The combined-modality treatment was well tolerated. © 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
962,"The impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples measured by the comet assay The comet assay is frequently used in human biomonitoring for the detection of exposure to genotoxic agents. Peripheral blood samples are most frequently used and tested either as whole blood or after isolation of lymphocytes (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC). To investigate a potential impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples, we exposed blood ex vivo to mutagens with different modes of genotoxic action. The comet assay was performed either directly with whole blood at the end of the exposure period or with lymphocytes isolated directly after exposure. In addition to the recommended standard protocol for lymphocyte isolation, a shortened protocol was established to optimise the isolation procedure. The results indicate that the effects of induced DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites induced by ionising radiation and alkylants, respectively, are significantly reduced in isolated lymphocytes. In contrast, oxidative DNA base damage (induced by potassium bromate) and stable bulky adducts (induced by benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide; BPDE) seem to be less affected. Our findings suggest that in vivo-induced DNA damage might also be reduced in isolated lymphocytes in comparison with the whole blood depending of the types of DNA damage induced. Because only small genotoxic effects can generally be expected in human biomonitoring studies with the comet assay after occupational and environmental exposure to genotoxic agents, any loss might be relevant and should be avoided. The possibility of such effects and their potential impact on variability of comet assay results in human biomonitoring should be considered when performing or evaluating such kind of studies.

1111,"Combined concomitant boost radiotherapy and chemotherapy in stage III-IV head and neck carcinomas: a comparison of toxicity and treatment results with those observed after radiotherapy alone BACKGROUND: Alteration of radiation therapy (RT) fractionation and the combination of chemotherapy (CT) with RT represent two predominant fields of current research in the treatment of head and neck carcinomas. To assess the potential integration of these two fields, a retrospective comparison of toxicity and treatment outcome was carried out in stage III-IV patients treated with a concomitant boost RT schedule with or without CT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated by RT alone and 35 by RT and CT. In the RT group, there were significantly fewer T3-4 tumors (56% vs. 88%, P = 0.002) and higher proportion of planned neck dissections (35% vs. 14%, P = 0.047). The planned total dose was 69.9 Gy delivered over 5.5 weeks. In 10 cases CT was given before RT and in 25 concomitantly with RT, either alone or with neoadjuvant and/ or adjuvant CT. All patients but two had cisplatin-based (CDDP, 100 mg/m2) CT, associated in 28 patients with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 1000 mg/m2/24 h x 5). The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 21 and 31 months for the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., RESULTS: Grade 3-4 acute toxicity (RTOG) was observed in 73% and 36% of patients, and grade 3 dysphagia in 31% and 57% (P = 0.02) respectively in the RT and RT-CT groups. The rates of grade 3-4 late complications were similar in the two groups (5% vs. 12%). At three years, actuarial loco-regional control (LRC) was 57% and 66% (P = 0.66) and overall survival was 56% and 47% (P = 0.99) in the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., CONCLUSIONS: While acute toxicity was higher compared with RT alone, this accelerated RT schedule was feasible in association with 5-FU/CDDP, even administered concomitantly. Despite the significant proportion of more advanced disease in the RT-CT group, LRC was similar to that obtained by RT alone. Combinations of concomitant boost RT and chemotherapy merit further investigation in prospective trials.",Excluded

630,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

548,"Trends in computed tomography utilization rates: a longitudinal practice-based study OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) use has increased dramatically over the past 2 decades, leading to increased radiation exposure at the population level. We assessed trends in CT use in a primary care (PC) population from 2000 to 2010., METHODS: Trends in CT use from 2000 to 2010 were assessed in an integrated, multi-specialty group practice. Administrative data were used to identify patients associated with a specific primary care provider and all CT imaging procedures. Utilization rates per 1000 patients and CT rates by type and medical specialty were calculated., RESULTS: Of 179,032 PC patients, 55,683 (31%) underwent CT. Mean age (SD) was 31.0 (23.6) years; 53% were female patients. In 2000, 178.5 CT scans per 1000 PC patients were performed, increasing to 195.9 in 2010 (10% absolute increase, P = 0.01). Although utilization rates across the 10-year period remained stable, emergency department (ED) CT examinations rose from 41.1 per 1000 in 2000 to 74.4 per 1000 in 2010 (81% absolute increase, P < 0.01). CT abdomen accounted for more than 50% of all CTs performed, followed by CT other (19%; included scans of the spine, extremities, neck and sinuses), CT chest (16%), and CT head (14%). Top diagnostic CT categories among those undergoing CT were abdominal pain, lower respiratory disease, and headache., CONCLUSIONS: Although utilization rates across the 10-year period remained stable, CT use in the ED substantially increased. CT abdomen and CT chest were the two most common studies performed and are potential targets for interventions to improve the appropriateness of CT use.",Excluded
570,"Accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography (CTCA) using prospective ECG-triggering for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Method(s): Thirty patients (19 male, 11 female, mean age 58.8+/-9.9 years) underwent low dose CTCA and invasive coronary angiography (CA) (median 2 days (0, 41)). Before CT scanning, intravenous beta-blocker was administered in 18/30 patients as heart rate (HR) was >65 beats per minute (bpm), achieving a mean HR of 55.7+/-7.9 bpm. CAD was defined as coronary artery narrowing >=50%, using CA as standard of reference. On an intention-to-diagnose-base all non-evaluative segments were included in the analysis.

254,"Long-term outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas at the BC cancer agency Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT.

However, 10% to 30% of these patients require repeat intervention to the irradiated site., METHODS: Of 961 patients who were assigned to gamma or beta radiation for the treatment of diffuse ISR, we evaluated the outcome of 282 (29%) consecutive patients who failed IRT and compared them with the 679 (71%) patients who had successful IRT. For patients who failed radiation, the mean time to the first target vessel revascularization (TVR) was 173 +/- 127 days after the index procedure and the total duration of follow-up was 494 +/- 304 days., RESULTS: Patients who failed IRT were younger (60 +/- 10 vs. 63 +/- 11 years, p = 0.002) and had a higher incidence of restenting (51% vs. 41%, p = 0.003). The majority (55%) of the restenotic lesions after IRT failure were focal (< or =10 mm), with a mean lesion length of 11.9 +/- 1.9 mm.

506,"Ventilatory inhomogeneity determined from multiple-breath washouts during sustained microgravity on Spacelab SLS-1 We used multiple-breath N2 washouts (MBNW) to study the inhomogeneity of ventilation in four normal humans (mean age 42.5 yr) before, during, and after 9 days of exposure to microgravity on Spacelab Life Sciences-1. Subjects performed 20-breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 700 ml and 12-breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 1,250 ml. Six indexes of ventilatory inhomogeneity were derived from data from 1) distribution of specific ventilation (SV) from mixed-expired and 2) end-tidal N2, 3) change of slope of N2 washout (semilog plot) with time, 4) change of slope of normalized phase III of successive breaths, 5) anatomic dead space, and 6) Bohr dead space. Significant ventilatory inhomogeneity was seen in the standing position at normal gravity (1 G). When we compared standing 1 G with microgravity, the distributions of SV became slightly narrower, but the difference was not significant. Also, there were no significant changes in the change of slope of the N2 washout, change of normalized phase III slopes, or the anatomic and Bohr dead spaces. By contrast, transition from the standing to supine position in 1 G resulted in significantly broader distributions of SV (P < 0.05) and significantly greater changes in the changes in slope of the N2 washouts (P < 0.001), indicating more ventilatory inhomogeneity in that posture. Thus these techniques can detect relatively small changes in ventilatory inhomogeneity. We conclude that the primary determinants of ventilatory inhomogeneity during tidal breathing in the upright posture are not gravitational in origin.",Excluded
392,"A novel lunar bed rest analogue INTRODUCTION: Humans will eventually return to the Moon and thus there is a need for a ground-based analogue to enable the study of physiological adaptations to lunar gravity. An important unanswered question is whether or not living on the lunar surface will provide adequate loading of the musculoskeletal system to prevent or attenuate the bone loss that is seen in microgravity. Previous simulations have involved tilting subjects to an approximately 9.5 degrees angle to achieve a lunar gravity component parallel to the long-axis of the body. However, subjects in these earlier simulations were not weight-bearing, and thus these protocols did not provide an analogue for load on the musculoskeletal system., METHODS: We present a novel analogue which includes the capability to simulate standing and sitting in a lunar loading environment. A bed oriented at a 9.5 degrees angle was mounted on six linear bearings and was free to travel with one degree of freedom along rails. This allowed approximately 1/6 body weight loading of the feet during standing. Lunar"" sitting was also successfully simulated., RESULTS: A feasibility study demonstrated that the analogue was tolerated by subjects for 6 d of continuous bed rest and that the reaction forces at the feet during periods of standing were a reasonable simulation of lunar standing. During the 6 d, mean change in the volume of the quadriceps muscles was -1.6% +/- 1.7%., DISCUSSION: The proposed analogue would appear to be an acceptable simulation of lunar gravity and deserves further exploration in studies of longer duration.""",Excluded

Methods and Materials: Seventy-six patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and another 76 with hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) were enrolled in volumetric analysis. All patients received allocated radiotherapy courses. Adaptive computed tomography was done 4 to 5 weeks after the start of IMRT. Primary tumor volume measurement was derived using separate images for the pretreatment gross tumor volume (pGTV) and the interval gross tumor volume. Result(s): In the OPC group, the pGTV ranged from 6.6 to 242.6 mL (mean, 49.9 mL), whereas the value of the VRR ranged from 0.014 to 0.74 (mean, 0.43). In HPC patients, the pGTV ranged from 4.1 to 152.4 mL (mean, 35.6 mL), whereas the VRR ranged from -1.15 to 0.79 (mean, 0.33). Multivariate analysis of the primary tumor relapse-free survival for OPC revealed three prognostic factors: T4 tumor (p = 0.0001, hazard ratio 7.38), pGTV >=20 mL (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 10.61), and VRR <0.5 (p = 0.001, hazard ratio 6.49). Multivariate analysis of the primary tumor relapse-free survival for HPC showed two prognostic factors: pGTV >=30 mL (p = 0.001, hazard ratio 2.87) and VRR <0.5 (p = 0.03, hazard ratio 2.25). Conclusion(s): The VRR is an outcome predictor for local control in OPC and HPC patients treated with IMRT. Those with large tumor volumes or a VRR <0.5 should be considered for a salvage operation or a dose-escalation scheme. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

215,"Colostomy is a simple and effective procedure for severe chronic radiation proctitis AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of diverting colostomy in treating severe hemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis (CRP)., METHODS: Patients with severe hemorrhagic CRP who were admitted from 2008 to 2014 were enrolled into this study. All CRP patients were diagnosed by a combination of pelvic radiation history, clinical rectal bleeding, and endoscopic findings. Inclusion criteria were CRP patients with refractory bleeding with moderate to severe anemia with a hemoglobin level < 90 g/L. The study group included patients who were treated by diverting colostomy, while the control group included patients who received conservative treatment. The remission of bleeding was defined as complete cessation or only occasional bleeding that needed no further treatment. The primary outcome was bleeding remission at 6 mo after treatment. Quality of life before treatment and at follow-up was evaluated according to EORTC QLQ C30. Severe CRP complications were recorded during follow-up., RESULTS: Forty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled, including 22 in the colostomy group and 27 in the conservative treatment group. When compared to conservative treatment, colostomy obtained a higher rate of bleeding remission (94% vs 12%), especially in control of transfusion-dependent bleeding (100% vs 0%), and offered a better control of refractory perianal pain (100% vs 0%), and a lower score of bleeding (P < 0.001) at 6 mo after treatment. At 1 year after treatment, colostomy achieved better remission of both moderate bleeding (100% vs 21.5%, P = 0.002) and severe bleeding (100% vs 0%, P < 0.001), obtained a lower score of bleeding (0.8 vs 2.0, P < 0.001), and achieved obvious elevated hemoglobin levels (P = 0.003), when compared to the conservative treatment group. The quality of life dramatically improved after colostomy, which included global health, function, and symptoms, but it was not improved in the control group. Pathological evaluation after colostomy found diffused chronic inflammation cells, and massive fibrosis collagen depositions under the rectal wall, which revealed potential fibrosis formation., CONCLUSION: Diverting colostomy is a simple, effective and safe procedure for severe hemorrhagic CRP. Colostomy can improve quality of life and reduce serious complications secondary to radiotherapy.",Excluded
520,"Cephalometry without complex dedicated postprocessing in an oriented magnetic resonance imaging dataset: a pilot study OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables a 3D-volume-imaging without ionizing radiation. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to present a post-processing-free method for cephalometric analysis of a MRI-dataset and to examine whether there is a significant difference between cephalometric analysis of conventional 2D cephalograms and MRI scans. METHOD(S): One MRI scan each was performed on three cadaver heads using a 3T-MR-scanner. Cephalometric analysis was conducted directly on the 3D dataset. All reference points were projected onto a virtual sagittal plane that was perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal plane. Double-sided points were averaged. Cephalometric angles were measured from the projected points. Results were compared with cephalometric measurements on conventional lateral cephalometric radiographs (LCRs). The cephalometric analysis was performed by five raters. RESULT(S): 390-angle measurements were obtained. The inter-rater reliability was high [intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) >= 0.74 for all angles]. Differences between the measurements on the cephalograms and MRI scans ranged between -0.91degree (-1.88degree, 0.07degree) and 0.97degree (-0.63degree, 2.57degree) on average and were equivalent with respect to a margin of [-2degree, 2degree] in all angles except L1-Me-Tgo (Bonferroni-Holm-corrected P < 0.05 in all angles except L1-Me-Tgo). The best match was found for the SNA angle. CONCLUSION(S): The clinical comparability of the MRI- and LCR-based cephalometry could be stated. Using MRI in orthodontics would reduce radiation exposure and the risk of stochastic radiation damage, which is of importance especially in younger patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Doses of 60-71 Gy with 2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction were applied. 26/29 patients were definitively irradiated, 86% received simultaneous cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 60% presented with locally advanced disease (T3/4 Nx, Tx N2c/3). Mean primary tumor volume measured 36.2 cm(3) (4-170 cm(3)), mean nodal volume 16.6 cm(3) (0-97 cm(3))., RESULTS: 2-year actuarial local, nodal, distant control, and overall disease-free survival were 90%, 93%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. In 2/4 patients with persistent disease (nodal in one, primary in three), salvage surgery was performed. The mean dose to the spinal cord (extension of > 5-15 mm) was 26 Gy (12-38 Gy); the mean maximum (point) dose was 44.4 Gy (26-58.9 Gy).

Larynx preservation was achieved in 25/26 of the definitively irradiated patients (one underwent a salvage laryngectomy); 23 had no or minimal dysphagia (G0-1)., CONCLUSION: Excellent early disease control and high patient satisfaction with swallowing function in HC following SIB IMRT were observed; these results need to be confirmed based on a longer follow-up period. In order to avoid G4 reactions, SIB doses of < 2.2 Gy/fraction are recommended for large tumors involving laryngeal structures.",Excluded
1091,"670 nm light mitigates oxygen-induced degeneration in C57BL/6J mouse retina BACKGROUND: Irradiation with light wavelengths from the far red (FR) to the near infrared (NIR) spectrum (600 nm -1000 nm) has been shown to have beneficial effects in several disease models. In this study, we aim to examine whether 670 nm red light pretreatment can provide protection against hyperoxia-induced damage in the C57BL/6J mouse retina. Adult mice (90-110 days) were pretreated with 9 J/cm2 of 670 nm light once daily for 5 consecutive days prior to being placed in hyperoxic environment (75% oxygen). Control groups were exposed to hyperoxia, but received no 670 nm light pretreatment. Retinas were collected after 0, 3, 7, 10 or 14 days of hyperoxia exposure (n = 12/group) and prepared either for histological analysis, or RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Photoreceptor damage and loss were quantified by counting photoreceptors undergoing cell death and measuring photoreceptor layer thickness. Localization of acrolein, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (Cox Va) were identified through immunohistochemistry. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox-1), complement component 3 (C3) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf-2) genes were quantified using qPCR., RESULTS: The hyperoxia-induced photoreceptor loss was accompanied by reduction of metabolic marker, Cox Va, and increased expression of oxidative stress indicator, acrolein and Hmox-1. Pretreatment with 670 nm red light reduced expression of markers of oxidative stress and C3, and slowed, but did not prevent, photoreceptor loss over the time course of hyperoxia exposure., CONCLUSION: The damaging effects of hyperoxia on photoreceptors were ameliorated following pretreatment with 670 nm light in hyperoxic mouse retinas. These results suggest that pretreatment with 670 nm light may provide stability to photoreceptors in conditions of oxidative stress.",Excluded
21,"Effects of laser irradiation on arthritic histopathology and heat shock protein 70 expression in C57 black mice with osteoarthritis OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of three different laser treatments (650 nm alone, 10.6 mum alone and combined laser of 650 nm and 10.6 mum) on experimental osteoarthritis of the knees in C57 black mice., METHODS: Sixty C57 black mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded
322,"Radiation Exposure to the Personnel Performing Robotic Arm-Assisted Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography-Guided Biopsies Purpose: The aim of the study was to estimate the radiation burden to personnel performing robotic arm-assisted positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-guided metabolic biopsies and to staff assisting the procedure in a PET/CT facility., Materials and Methods: We estimated the whole-body exposures to physicians and staff based on the dose rate measurement with an ionization chamber-based calibrated survey monitor and pocket dosimeters during the robotic arm-assisted 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT-guided biopsies from September 2016 to February 2017. In addition, we also noted the time to biopsy after injection and total biopsy time during which the staff was exposed to the radiation., Results: In this prospective study, PET/CT-guided biopsy was performed in 50 patients (males - 36, females - 14) with a mean age of 54 +/- 15 years (range17-78 years). Of the 50 biopsy procedures, 18 were lung biopsies, 10 were bone biopsies, and 22 biopsies were from abdomen/pelvic lesions. The mean time taken for the procedure was 26 +/- 11 min. The mean time elapsed between injection and procedure was 182 +/- 85 min and mean injected activity of 138.38 +/- 74 MBq. The mean whole-body exposure per procedure to an interventionist and an assistant was 1.88 +/- 0.82 muSv and 1.04 +/- 0.75 muSv, respectively. The mean exposure rates at 0-m and 1-m distance from the patient were 30.77 +/- 14.61 muSv/h and 2.59 +/- 1.49 muSv/h, respectively., Conclusion: We conclude that the interventionist received the highest mean effective dose as compared to the helping staffs. The occupational radiation exposure was found to be within the limits as specified by the regulatory authorities (International Commission on Radiological Protection-103), and PET/CT-guided biopsies were safe from radiation protection point of view.",Excluded

676,"A paradigm shift in the monitoring of patients with acromegaly: Last available growth hormone may overestimate risk Context: Acromegaly is associated with reduced life expectancy, which has been reported to be normalized if treatment is successful in controlling GH/IGF-I levels. Objective(s): Most previous studies have invariably used the last available GH/IGF-I, which may be biased as it only assesses exposure at a single point in time.Wecompared the last available GH/IGF-I analysis to a time-dependent""andcumulativemethod,during follow-up to assess risk of mortality in the West Midlands Acromegaly study (n = 501). Result(s): Using the last available GH, there was a statistically significant increase in mortality comparing groups as low as GH <= 1 mug/L vs >1 mug/L (relative risks [RR] 1.8, P = .03). This was not the case when using the ""time-dependent method,"" where only comparisons of GH values of GH <=5 mug/L vs >5 mug/L were suggestive of being associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR = 1.5, P = .08). When the time-dependent GH method of analysis was used, the RR of mortality at each level was lower and the associated P value was less significant. Irrespective of using the last available or time-dependent method, when IGF-I was divided into levels according to quartile or arbitrary cutoffs, there was no significant increase in mortality with higher levels. Conclusion(s): This study emphasizes the potential bias of using the latest available GH/IGF-I levels to predict mortality. Our study again highlights the limitations of IGF-I in predicting mortality. Copyright © 2014 by the Endocrine Society.""",Excluded
231,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
197,"Model-based Iterative Reconstruction Compared to Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction and Filtered Back-projection in CT of the Kidneys and the Adjacent Retroperitoneum Rationale and Objectives: To prospectively evaluate the perceived image quality of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) compared to adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and filtered back-projection (FBP) in computed tomography (CT) of the kidneys and retroperitoneum. Material(s) and Method(s): With investigational review board and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, 17 adults underwent 31 contrast-enhanced CT acquisitions at constant tube potential and current (range 30-300 mA). Each was reconstructed with MBIR, ASIR (50%), and FBP. Four reviewers scored each reconstruction's perceived image quality overall and the perceived image quality of seven imaging features that were selected by the authors as being relevant to imaging in the region and pertinent to the evaluation of high-quality diagnostic CT. Result(s): MBIR perceived image quality scored superior to ASIR and FBP both overall (P < .001) and for observations of the retroperitoneal fascia (99.2%), corticomedullary differentiation (94.4%), renal hilar structures (96.8%), focal renal lesions (92.5%), and mitigation of streak artifact (100.0%; all, P < .001). MBIR achieved diagnostic overall perceived image quality with approximately half the radiation dose required by ASIR and FBP. The noise curve of MBIR was significantly lower and flatter (P < .001). Conclusion(s): Compared to ASIR and FBP, MBIR provides superior perceived image quality, both overall and for several specific imaging features, across a broad range of tube current levels, and requires approximately half the radiation dose to achieve diagnostic overall perceived image quality. Accordingly, MBIR should enable CT scanning with improved perceived image quality and/or reduced radiation exposure. © 2014 AUR.",Excluded
7,"Time course of pain relief in patients treated with radiotherapy for cancer pain: a prospective study OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective study was to analyze time course of pain relief by radiotherapy for cancer pain., METHODS: A total of 91 patients with painful bone metastases were treated by radiotherapy with a median total dose of 46 Gy. Pain of the irradiated site was assessed using a numerical rating scale (pain score: 0 to 10) once a week from the beginning of radiotherapy (day 1) for about 5 weeks., RESULTS: In time course analysis of the 91 cases, the mean (+/-SD) pain scores at day 5, day 12, day 19, day 26, day 33, and day 40 were 7.8 (+/-1.6), 5.3 (+/-2.5), 3.5 (+/-2.5), 2.4 (+/-2.5), 1.6 (+/-2.1), and 1.1 (+/-1.9), respectively, and mean pain score was significantly reduced with time from the start of radiotherapy (P<0.001: repeated measure ANOVA). Mean pain score was significantly reduced every week by d33 (P<0.05: d5 vs. d12, d12 vs. d19, d19 vs. d26, and d26 vs. d33). Complete pain relief was obtained in 45/91 (49%) cases, and partial (> or =50%) pain relief was obtained in 83/91 (91%) cases. The mean time to obtain 50% pain relief was 13 days. The mean time to obtain complete pain relief (n=45) was 24 days. Doses of analgesics were reduced in 28/64 (44%) cases at the end of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Telling approximate time course of pain relief seems to reduce patients' anxiety, and knowing time course of pain relief seems to be useful to determine optimal dose of analgesics that changes according to the course.",Excluded
92,"DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genetic expressions as response markers in locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy This study is to investigate multiple chemotherapeutic agent- and radiation-related genetic biomarkers in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients following fluoropyrimidine-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for response prediction. We initially selected 6 fluoropyrimidine metabolism-related genes (DPYD, ORPT, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2) and 3 radiotherapy response-related genes (GLUT1, HIF-1 alpha, and HIF-2 alpha) as targets for gene expression identification in 60 LARC cancer specimens. Subsequently, a high-sensitivity weighted enzymatic chip array was designed and constructed to predict responses following CCRT. After CCRT, 39 of 60 (65%) LARC patients were classified as responders (pathological tumor regression grade 2 ~ 4). Using a panel of multiple genetic biomarkers (chip), including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2, at a cutoff value for 3 positive genes, a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 81% were obtained (AUC: 0.915; 95% CI: 0.840-0.991). Negative chip results were significantly correlated to poor CCRT responses (TRG 0-1) (P = 0.014, hazard ratio: 22.704, 95% CI: 3.055-235.448 in multivariate analysis). Disease-free survival analysis showed significantly better survival rate in patients with positive chip results (P = 0.0001). We suggest that a chip including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genes is a potential tool to predict response in LARC following fluoropyrimidine-based CCRT. © 2013 Ming-Yii Huang et al.",Excluded

704,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.",Included

Method(s): Esophageal cancer patients with clinical Stage II-III (T1N1M0 or T2-3N0-1M0) were eligible. Radiotherapy was administered to a total dose of 50.4 Gy with elective nodalirradiation of 41.4 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy comprised two courses of 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/day) on days 1-4 and 2-h infusion of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) on Day 1; this was repeated every 4 weeks. Two courses of 5-fluorouracil with cisplatin were added. Result(s): Fifty-one patients were enrolled in the study from June 2006 to May 2008. The characteristics of the 51 patients enrolled were as follows: median age 64 years; male/female, 45/6; performance status 0/1, 32/19 patients; Stage IIA/IIB/III, 9/20/22 patients, respectively. A complete response was achieved in 36 patients (70.6%). The 1- and 3-year overall survival rate was 88.2 and 63.8%, respectively. The median 1- and 3-year progression-free survival rate was 66.7% (80% CI: 57-74%) and 56.6% (80% CI: 47.1-64.9%), respectively.

958,"CT and FDG-PET radiologic biomarkers in p16+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy Purpose: To assess associations between imaging biomarkers from standard of care pre-treatment CT and FDG-PET scans and locoregional (LR) and distant metastatic (DM) recurrences in patients with p16+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): An institutional database from a single NCI-designated cancer center identified 266 patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with definitive CRT in our department from 2005 to 2016 with evaluable pre-treatment FDG-PET scans. Quantitative SUV metrics and qualitative imaging metrics were determined from FDG-PET and CT scans, while clinical characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. Associations between clinical/imaging features and time to LR (TTLRF) or DM (TTDMF) failure and overall survival (OS) were assessed using univariable Cox regression and penalized stepwise regression for multivariable analyses (MVA). Result(s): There were 27 LR and 32 DM recurrences as incident failures. Imaging biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF, with metabolic tumor volume being the only significant feature selected on MVA: C-index = 0.68 (p = 0.01). Radiographic extranodal extension (rENE), positive retropharyngeal nodes (RPN+), and clinical stage were significant on MVA for TTDMF: C-index = 0.84 (p < 0.001). rENE, group stage, and RPN+ were significant on MVA for OS: C-index = 0.77 (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In the largest study to date of uniformly treated patients with CRT to evaluate both pretreatment CT and FDG-PET, radiographic biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS among patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with CRT. CT metrics performed best to predict TTDMF, while FDG-PET metrics showed improved prediction for LRRFS. These metrics may help identify candidates for treatment intensification or de-escalation of therapy. Statement of translational relevance: Pre-treatment imaging features from standard-of-care PET/CT imaging show promise for predicting long-term outcomes following HPV-associated oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) therapy. This study comprehensively characterizes qualitative and quantitative pre-treatment imaging metrics associated with time to pattern-specific failure in a cohort of 266 patients treated uniformly with definitive chemoradiation. Multivariate analysis (MVA) for time to locoregional failure (TTLRF), time to distant metastatic failure (TTDMF), and overall survival (OS) was performed. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF. CT radiographic extranodal extension, positive retropharyngeal nodes, and stage strongly predicted TTDMF (combined C-index = 0.84, log rank p < 0.001). Number of smoking pack-years complemented clinical and imaging features only in patients without radiographic extranodal extension or positive retropharyngeal nodes. Time to pattern-specific failure is important for guiding treatment de-escalation strategies, which intend to reduce treatment-related toxicity in patients with relatively long expected survival times. This study suggests that PET/CT features should play a crucial role in future de-escalation trials and management of HPV-OPC patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

55,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007 What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know. We repeat the call of ecologist Sandra Steingraber: From the right to know and the duty to inquire flows the obligation to act.""""",Excluded
740,"Serum cystatin C and risk of hip and nonvertebral fractures in older men Serum cystatin C is a biomarker of renal function; higher levels indicate poorer function. Previous studies have reported an increased risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women with higher cystatin C, but there is a paucity of data in men and it is uncertain whether the association persists after adjustment for BMD. To test the hypothesis that older community-dwelling men with higher cystatin C are at increased risk of fracture, we conducted a case-cohort analysis in MrOS, a prospective study of 5994 men aged 65 years and older. We measured serum cystatin C in baseline serum specimens from all 435 men who experienced any non-vertebral fracture from baseline until February 2007 (average follow-up 4.7 years), all 168 men with first hip fracture from baseline until August 2010 (average follow-up 7.6 years), and a sample of 1602 men randomly selected from the cohort. Cystatin C was measured using a particle-enhanced immunonepholometric assay (inter- and intra-assay CV 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively). Fractures were confirmed with x-ray reports. Modified proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative hazards (RH) of fracture in men across quartiles of cystatin C (cutpoints 0.80, 0.90, 1.03 mg/L). In a model adjusted for age, race, site and body mass index, higher cystatin C was not related to risk of nonvertebral fracture (p-trend 0.88), but was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture (RH (95% CI): 1.0 [Q1, referent group]; 0.9 (0.5-1.7) [Q2]; 1.1 (0.6-1.9) [Q3]; and 1.6 (0.9-2.8) [Q4]; p-trend 0.04). The majority of the effect of cystatin C on hip fracture was observed among men in Q4 who had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.1-2.3) increase in risk compared with men in Q1-3 (Table). Adding potential confounders (including fall history, prior fracture, prevalent cardiovascular disease, frailty status and total hip BMD) one at a time to the base model modestly attenuated the association, with frailty status having the greatest impact. After simultaneous adjustment for multiple confounders, the association no longer reached significance (RH (95% CI) Q4 versus Q1-3: 1.3 (0.9-1.9)). In conclusion, older men with higher serum cystatin C are at increased risk of hip (but not any nonvertebral) fracture. The association between cystatin C and hip fracture is due at least in part to the greater prevalence of frailty among men with higher cystatin C levels.",Excluded

CT has advantages of fast speed, higher spatial resolution, and simultaneous lung and airway visualization. The purpose of this pictorial review is to discuss the role of CT and emphasize its protocol and the segmental approach for comprehensive assessment of CHD. Copyright © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

1143,"Smartr nuclear imaging-clinical experiences of a new cardiac imaging system Background: Cardiac imaging is a large part of the Nuclear Imaging workload in Australia and New Zealand, there is many modalities and techniques in practice competing to provide good quality studies to the patients and referring clinicians. This presentation discusses one of the newest technologies available and how this new imaging technology has impacted on our department patient workload as well as patient outcomes including reduction of radiation doses, study efficacy and patient comfort/ compliance. Aim(s): To provide information to fellow Nuclear Medicine Technologists of new techniques in Cardiac imaging and how new scanning methods have changed patient radiation doses and patient workflow, as well as the improvements in patient compliance and comfort. Method(s): This presentation outlines the improvements from clinical practice and experiences over the last two years in a busy private nuclear medicine practice. Result(s): Since the introduction of new imaging technology in early 2014 we have experienced improved count sensitivity from this new technology as well as significant reductions in patient radiation dose. We have also seen better patient compliance and comfort levels, as well as changes in patient workflow though our department. Conclusion(s): Nuclear medicine must remain competitive with other imaging modalities to stay relevant in the dynamic environment of medical imaging. This new technology has the potential to do this. It produces the same if not better quality scan using a reduced radiation dose and decrease time, we have also seen improvements in patient comfort and compliance.",Excluded
1210,"Registry of Plutonium-induced Lung Fibrosis in a Russian Nuclear Worker Cohort A registry of plutonium-induced lung fibrosis diagnosed in members of a cohort of the first Russian nuclear industry facility Mayak Production Association was established. The registry includes 188 plutonium-induced lung fibrosis diagnoses: 117 (62.23%) in males and 71 (37.77%) in females. This paper describes the structure and detailed characteristics of the registry. Plutonium-induced lung fibrosis was shown to have no association with cumulative lung absorbed dose from external gamma rays as of the date of diagnosis. On the contrary, the plutonium-induced lung fibrosis rate was shown to be associated with cumulative lung absorbed dose from incorporated alpha particles and to increase significantly with increasing dose from internal radiation exposure. This paper discusses potential applications of the registry to scientific investigations in the future.",Included
1038,"Radiation exposure to the spine surgeon in lumbar and thoracolumbar fusions with the use of an intraoperative computed tomographic 3-dimensional imaging system STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical research article., OBJECTIVE: The primary goals were to determine (1) radiation exposure to the spine surgeon with the use of an intraoperative 3-dimensional imaging system and (2) to define the safe distance from the computed tomographic scanner., SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND: Intraoperative radiation exposure to the spinal surgeon has been assessed during 2-dimensional fluoroscopy but has not been investigated during intraoperative 3-dimensional imaging., METHODS: Ten patients undergoing lumbar or thoracolumbar fusion were enrolled in a prospective trial to determine the radiation exposure to a spine surgeon standing in the substerile room, with the use of the O-ARM Imaging System (Medtronic, Memphis, TN). A thermolucent digital dosimeter was worn at chest level without a lead apron. Dosimeter readings and distance from the spine surgeon were recorded. RESULTS .: Average surgeon exposure was 44.22 +/- 17.4 murem (range: 17.71-70.76 murem). The mean distance from the O-ARM was 4.56 +/- .32 m, and the surgeon was exposed for an average of 19.6 +/- 5.7 seconds (range: 8.05-28.7 s). The annual number of necessary procedures required to surpass the exposure limit, according to the data presented here, would be 113,071 operations using O-ARM. Hence, the number of necessary procedures for O-ARM use is predicted to be 1,130,710 annual procedures to reach the occupational exposure limits for extremity, skin, and all other organs and 339,213 procedures to reach the limits for the lens of eye., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is minimal to the surgical team during routine use of the O-ARM imaging system. The number of procedures required to surpass occupational exposure limits is high if using appropriate distance from the O-ARM.",Excluded
758,"Formalin application for the treatment of radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis Radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis (RIHP) is a serious complication of pelvic irradiation, and a 4% formalin solution has been used for 20 years in treating this sequelae. The first case involving formalin application for treatment of RIHP in Korea was reported in 1996, but there are no additional studies beyond this date. Our study reviews the use of formalin instillation and selective application. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the outcome of such treatments, beginning with the first case at our hospital. From 1996 to 2005, five RIHP patients had received formalin treatment for RIHP symptoms intractable to other medical treatments. All treatments were performed by a single surgeon in the operating room, under spinal anesthesia or intravenous sedation. The mean duration of symptoms before treatment was 15.6 months (which was longer than in other studies), and the transfusion before treatment varied from once per month to twice per week. Using sigmoidoscopy, 100 ml of a 4% formalin solution was instilled directly (or by using a formalin-soaked gauze) and irrigated for five minutes. Formalin-soaked cotton was then applied selectively to focal remnant lesions. Four patients improved after the first treatment, but one patient received the treatment twice because of recurrent symptoms. Complications after treatment included perianal pain (one case), and aggravated incontinence (one case), which improved three months after conservative management. In conclusion, the formalin combination application method in our study is comparable to other formalin treatments for intractable RIHP.",Excluded
50,"Fluoroscopy Learning Curve in Hip Arthroscopy-A Single Surgeon's Experience PURPOSE: To determine if (1) absorbed radiation dose and (2) fluoroscopy time decreased with experience over the first 100 cases of a single surgeon's hip arthroscopy practice., METHODS: Subjects who underwent hip arthroscopy for symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement and labral injury were eligible for analysis. Inclusion criteria included the first 100 subjects who underwent hip arthroscopy by a single surgeon (December 2013 to December 2014). Subject demographics, procedure details, fluoroscopy absorbed dose (milligray [mGy]), and time were recorded. Subjects were categorized by date of surgery to one of 4 possible groups (25 per group). One-way analysis of variance was used to determine if a significant difference in dose (mGy) or time was present between groups. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relation between case number and both radiation dose and fluoroscopy time., RESULTS: Subjects underwent labral repair (n = 93), cam osteoplasty (n = 90), and pincer acetabuloplasty (n = 65). There was a significant (P < .001 for both) linear regression between case number and both radiation dose and fluoroscopy time. A significant difference in mGy was observed between groups, group 1 the highest and group 4 the lowest amounts of radiation (P = .003). Comparing individual groups, group 4 was found to have a significantly lower amount of radiation than group 1 (P = .002), though it was not significantly lower than that of group 2 (P = .09) or group 3 (P = .08). A significant difference in fluoroscopy time was observed between groups, group 1 the highest and group 4 the lowest times (P = .05). Comparing individual groups, group 4 was found to have a significantly lower fluoroscopy time than group 1 (P = .039). Correction for weight, height, and body mass index all revealed the same findings: significant (P < .05) differences in both dose and time across groups., CONCLUSIONS: The absorbed dose of radiation and fluoroscopy time decreased significantly over the first 100 cases of a single surgeon's hip arthroscopy practice learning curve., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic, retrospective, noncomparative case series.

1040,"Trends in radiation dose and technique for anal canal squamous cell carcinoma Background: Anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is managed definitively with chemo and XRT, reserving surgery for salvage. Many different radiation dose schemes have been used, varying from 30 Gy to doses exceeding 60 Gy. RTOG 0529 established IMRT as a standard of care for anal canal SCC, using doses of 50.4-54 Gy. We used the National Cancer Database(NCDB) to examine trends in dose selection and radiation technique over time, as well as any potential effect on outcome. Method(s): We queried the NCDB from 2004-2015 for cases of anal canal SCC stage 1-3, treated with definitive doses of XRT to the pelvis with chemo. Dose escalation was defined as > 54 Gy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of increased dose and overall survival (OS). Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios for survival were used to account for indication bias. Result(s): We identified 7,792 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, with 4,269 treated to conventional doses and 3,163 treated to > 54 Gy. Patients that were older, had government or private insurance, were treated with IMRT, or at an academic center in a more recent year were less likely to get dose escalation. Increasing T and N stage were predictive of escalated dose. The use of dose escalation decreased over time, from 50% in 2005 to 30% in 2015. In contrast, IMRT use increased over that time from 2% to 63%. On multivariable analysis increasing age, higher comorbidity score, treatment at an academic center, and increasing stage corresponded to worse OS. Increased income, private insurance, IMRT use, increased distance to facility, and female gender all predicted improved OS. Multivariable analysis with propensity score included confirmed increased age, higher comorbidity score, income, distance, and gender as predictive of OS. In addition, escalated dose was found to have inferior outcome (OR: 1.10 95%CI: 1.01-1.20, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): The results of this NCDB analysis show a steady increase in the use of IMRT over time, with a corresponding decrease in dose escalation. In this study, dose escalation was shown to have inferior outcomes, although that result is likely influenced by the increasing age, stage, and comorbidity scores in that group of patients.",Excluded
75,"Targeted alpha particle immunotherapy for myeloid leukemia Unlike beta particle-emitting isotopes, a emitters can selectively kill individual cancer cells with a single atomic decay. HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters 131I and 90Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope 213Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg 213Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the 213Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts. This study demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and antileukemic effects of 213Bi-HuM195, and it is the first proof-of-concept for systemic targeted a particle immunotherapy in humans. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.",Excluded
240,"Robotic radiosurgery in the management of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies Purpose: We evaluated our therapeutic results in patients with paranasal sinus or nasal cavity malignanc ies treated by robotic radiosurgery. Materials: The medical charts of 17 patients with paranasal or nasal cavity malignancies treated by robotic radiosurgery (RRS)+/- external beam radiotherapy were assessed in this retrospective study. Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions). Those 2 patients had also serious ipsilate ral facial pain requiring narcotic analgesics, and they also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with no need of surgical debridement. No visual acuity loss was observed during follow-up. Minor bleeding, which was spontaneously stopped, was seen in one patient. Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgery seems to be an alternative and tolerable therapeutic option either in recurrent or primary paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies. However, longer follow-up periods are required to see the safety of RRS particulary in terms of late effects.",Excluded
991,"Accelerated radiotherapy and concomitant high dose chemotherapy in non resectable stage IV locally advanced HNSCC: Results of a GORTEC randomized trial Background: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a strong increase of the dose-intensity of concomitant radio-chemotherapy (RT-CT) in patients with far advanced non metastatic HNSCC. Method(s): Eligible patients had N3 disease (UICC 1997) and the primary tumor and/or the node(s) had to be strictly unresectable. Patients with palpable N2B-C were also eligible if massive nodal involvement was present. 109 patients were included, with 53 randomized to RT-CT and 56 to accelerated RT. In the RT-CT arm, the RT regimen consisted of 64 Gy in 5 weeks and the CT regimen consisted of synchronous CDDP 100 mg/m2 on days 2, 16, and 30 and 5FU 1000 mg/m2 on days1-5 and 29-33 of the RT course. After RT-CT, two adjuvant cycles of CDDP-5FU were delivered in good responders. A control arm was using a very accelerated RT, delivering 64 Gy in 3 weeks. Result(s): The most common tumor sites were oropharynx and hypopharynx. Most of the patients had T4 disease (70%) and 100% had a massive nodal involvement (mainly N3 with a mean nodal size >7 cm in both arms). A significant difference was observed in favor of the RT-CT arm (p = 0.005) in terms of cumulative incidence of local regional failure or distant metastases. However, the overall survival and event free survival rates were not significantly different between the two arms (p = 0.70 and 0.16, respectively). The lack of survival benefit in favor of the RT-CT was partly due to an excess of initial early treatment related death in the RT-CT arm. Conclusion(s): The very intense RT-CT schedule was more efficient on disease control, but was also more toxic than accelerated RT alone, pointing out that there was no clear improvement of the therapeutic index. This study shows the limits of dose-intensification, with regard to concomitant RT-CT. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
838,"A randomized comparison of methods of selecting narrowband UV-B starting dose to treat chronic psoriasis Objectives: To compare narrowband UV-B (TL-01 lamp) phototherapy for psoriasis with individual patient starting doses based on minimal erythemal dose (MED) determination vs a standard fixed starting dose and to compare the efficacy of 70% of MED vs 50% of MED starting dose regimens. Design(s): Single-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. Setting(s): Department of Dermatology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland. Patient(s): A total of 210 adult patients (207 of skin phototypes I to III) referred for narrowband UV-B to treat chronic psoriasis. The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a difference of 3 or more treatments to clearance and/ or minimal residual activity (MRA) between groups. Intervention(s): Narrowband UV-B phototherapy was given according to 3 standard regimens, differing only by starting dose selection method. The randomly allocated starting doses were (1) a fixed starting dose, (2) 70% of individual MED, and (3) 50% of individual MED. All patients were MED tested to ensure blinding and for safety reasons. Main Outcome Measure(s): The number of treatments to clearance and/or MRA of psoriasis was the primary efficacy outcome measure, with changes in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and Psoriasis Disability Index scores as secondary measures. Adverse effects were recorded. Result(s): There were no significant differences in the number of treatments to clearance and/or MRA across all 3 groups or in the percentages achieving clearance in each group. More uncomfortable erythemas occurred in the 50% of MED starting dose group (39%) than in the 70% of MED starting dose group (24%) or the fixed starting dose group (24%) (P=.07). Conclusion(s): The methods of determining the starting dose in this predominantly skin phototype I and II population, treated 3 times weekly, with a 20% followed by 10% incremental reduction in dose, did not significantly influence the effectiveness of treatment. Had there been a clinically important difference in efficacy, we would have expected to identify this. Thus, basing starting dose on individual MED assessments may not influence the treatment's efficacy in a skin phototype I to III population, although it remains important for patient safety. It remains possible that in populations containing individuals with a broader range of erythemal sensitivity, basing the starting dose on MED testing could have an important impact on treatment effectiveness.

87,"The QUANTEC criteria for parotid gland dose and their efficacy to prevent moderate to severe patient-rated xerostomia Background. Recently, the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) Group defined dose-volume constraints for the parotid glands to avoid severe xerostomia. The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. Material and methods. The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk. Results. In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met. Conclusions. Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
410,"Gastric emptying measurement of liquid nutrients using the 13C-octanoate breath test in critically ill patients: A comparison with scintigraphy Purpose: Scintigraphy is considered the most accurate technique for the measurement of gastric emptying (GE) but, for patients in the intensive care unit, it is technically demanding, involves radiation and can interfere with care. The 13C-octanoate breath test (13C-OBT) is a simple, non-invasive technique that does not involve radiation exposure. Aim(s): To evaluate the performance of the 13C-OBT in the assessment of GE in critically ill patients. Method(s): The GE was assessed in 33 mechanically ventilated patients (23 M; 54.3 +/- 3.0 yrs; APACHE II: 22.0 +/- 1.1). Following test meal administration (100 ml Ensure), concurrent scintigraphic measurement and breath samples (13C-OBT) were collected over 4 h. Scintigraphic meal retention was determined and the gastric emptying coefficient (GEC) and half emptying time [t50(BT)] were calculated for the 13C-OBT. Delayed GE was defined as meal retention >13 % at 180 min. Result(s): Delayed GE was identified in 27/33 patients. Meal retention correlated modestly with t50(BT) (r = 0.55-0.66; P < 0.001) and well with GEC (r = -0.63 to -0.74; P < 0.0001). The strength of agreement between the two techniques was highest between GEC and retention at 120 min. The best cut-off GEC for defining delayed GE was 3.25 (AUC = 0.75; 95 % CI = 0.52-0.99; P = 0.05), with 89 % sensitivity and 67 % specificity to detect delayed GE. The GE was delayed in all (23/23) patients with feed intolerance (GRV > 250 ml) on scintigraphy and 91 % (21/23) patients on 13C-OBT. Conclusion(s): In critical illness, there was a correlation between 13C-OBT and gastric scintigraphy, with GEC performing as a better and more sensitive marker of detecting delayed GE than t50. However the relatively wide 95 % confidence intervals suggest that 13C-OBT is more suitable as a technique to assess GE in a group setting for research studies rather than for individual patients in clinical practice. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM.",Excluded
451,"Radiation protection value to the operator from augmented reality smart glasses in interventional fluoroscopy procedures using phantoms INTRODUCTION: Smart glasses can be adapted to display radiographic images to allow clinician's gaze not to be directionally fixed or predetermined by computer monitor location. This study presents an analysis of eye lens dose during interventional fluoroscopy guided procedures, comparing fixed monitor positions against the use of smart glasses., METHODS: Using a head phantom (simulating the clinician), thermoluminescent dosimeters and lead shielded glasses, the dose to the eye was measured for different head 'rotations and tilts' for: gaze directed towards the main scattering source (patient/primary beam) to represent potential gaze direction if smart glasses are used; gaze directed to a range of potential computer monitor positions. An anthropomorphic pelvis phantom was utilised to simulate the patient. Accumulated dose rates (muGy s-1) from five 10-second exposures at 75 kV 25.2 mAs were recorded., RESULTS: An average DAP reading of 758.84 cGy cm2 was measured during each 10 second exposure. Whilst wearing lead shielded glasses a 6.10 - fold reduction in dose rate to the lens is possible (p < 0.05). Influence of the direction of gaze by the clinician demonstrated a wide range of dose rate reduction from 3.13% (p = 0.16) to 143.69% (p < 0.05) when the clinician's gaze was towards the main scattering source. Increased dose rate to the clinician's eyes was received despite wearing lead shielded glasses, as the angle of gaze moved 45degree and 90degree from 0degree., CONCLUSION: If the clinician's gaze is directed towards the main scattering source a potential exists for reducing eye lens dose compared with fixed location computer monitors. Introduction of lead lined smart glasses into interventional radiology may lead to improvements in patient care, reducing the need for the clinician to look away from the patient to observe a radiographic image.

4,"Radiolabeled neurotensin analog, 99mTc-NT-XI, evaluated in ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients UNLABELLED: The study aim was to assess the safety, biodistribution, tissue kinetics, and tumor uptake of the (99m)Tc-labeled neurotensin (NT) analog NT-XI., METHODS: Four patients presenting ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma were studied with (99m)Tc-NT-XI. Patients were followed by scintigraphy up to 4 h and by continued blood and urinary sampling until surgery 18-22 h after injection. Surgical tissue samples were analyzed for radioactivity uptake and NT receptor expression., RESULTS: No side effects were observed on injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI. Blood biologic half-lives alpha and beta were 35 min (range, 17-62 min) and 230 min (range, 107-383 min), respectively. Repeated whole-body scintigraphy performed in 2 patients showed a single exponential decrease of whole-body activity with half-lives of 101 and 232 min. Tracer elimination was mainly renal, with 92% and 98% of activity counted in urine in the first 20 h. Kidney, liver, spleen, and bone marrow activity uptake was observed in all patients. Tumor was not visualized in the first 3 patients but could be localized by tomoscintigraphy in the pancreas head region of patient 4. In vitro tissue analysis showed high expression of NT receptor in the tumor of patient 4, correlated with the highest tumor radioactivity uptake and the highest tumor-to-fat radioactivity ratio. In vitro receptor expression was also positive in a second patient having a tumor characterized by very low cellularity; however, the remaining 2 tumors lacked NT receptor expression., CONCLUSION: Injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI was well tolerated. The in vivo tumor uptake appeared specific as it was observed in the 1 patient with a pancreatic tumor that expressed high amounts of NT receptor. The results are compatible with preclinical animal results and in favor of further development of radiolabeled NT analogs for diagnosis or therapy of cancer.",Excluded
593,"The midbrain raphe nuclei mediate primary reinforcement via GABA(A) receptors Because rats learn to lever-press for brief electrical stimulation of the median and dorsal raphe nuclei (MRN and DRN, respectively), these brain sites have long been implicated in reward processes. However, it is not clear whether the MRN and DRN integrate reward-related signals or merely contain fibers of passage involved in reward processes. To shed light on this issue, the present study employed chemicals that selectively modulate neurotransmission, in particular the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol. Rats quickly learned to lever-press for muscimol infusions (50 and 100 microM) into the MRN or DRN. Muscimol was not self-administered when cannulae were placed just outside these nuclei. The reinforcing effects of muscimol appeared to be greater when the drug was administered into the MRN than into the DRN, as demonstrated by higher infusion rates and better response discrimination. These observations are consistent with the additional finding that muscimol administration into the MRN, but not the DRN, induced conditioned place preference. The reinforcing effects of muscimol administration into the MRN were blocked by coadministration of the GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin (100 microM) and by pretreatment with the dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.025 mg/kg, i.p.). The present results suggest that median and dorsal raphe neurons presumably inhibited by muscimol via GABA(A) receptors are involved in integration of primary reinforcement, and that median raphe neurons exert tonic inhibition over dopamine-dependent reward circuitry. The midbrain raphe nuclei may be involved in a variety of reward-related phenomena including drug addiction.",Excluded
720,"Is lateral opening of the cup related to pelvic tilt on the surgical table? Introduction: Surgical table and floor are the usual references for positioning the cup. This is correct if pelvis is perpendicular to them (tilt 0degree). But if shoulder girdle is wider than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the feet. And if shoulder girdle is narrower than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the head. Objective(s): To analyse pelvic tilt on surgical table ant its influence on lateral opening of the cup. Method(s): Prospective, blind, observational study. Fifty THA patients (26 female), 1 department, multiple surgeons. Lateral decubitus, horizontal surgical table, conventional anterior (pubic) and posterior (lumbar spine) supports. Preoperative measures: (with custom-made measuring device) width of shoulder and pelvic girdles, pelvic tilt (angle between horizontal surgical table and a line by both antero-superior iliac spines), pelvic tilt towards head or feet. Postero-lateral approach. Theoretical position of cup intended by surgeons: 45degree valgus. Post-surgical x-ray: measure of lateral opening of cup. Result(s): 21/50 (4 males): pelvic girdle 27 mm wider than shoulder girdle (female phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 7degree towards head, theoretical risk of horizontal cup. Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded

Patients who were treated with BNCT for either local recurrent or newly diagnosed unresectable head or neck cancers between December 2001 and September 2007 were included. Clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes were retrieved from hospital records. Either a combination of borocaptate sodium and boronophenylalanine (BPA) or BPA alone were used as boron compounds. In all the treatment cases, the dose constraint was set to deliver a dose <10-12 Gy-eq to the skin or oral mucosa. There was a patient cohort of 62, with a median follow-up of 18.7 months (range, 0.7-40.8). A total of 87 BNCT procedures were performed. The overall response rate was 58% within 6 months after BNCT. The median survival time was 10.1 months from the time of BNCT. The 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 43.1% and 24.2%, respectively. The major acute Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were hyperamylasemia (38.6%), fatigue (6.5%), mucositis/stomatitis (9.7%) and pain (9.7%), all of which were manageable. Three patients died of treatment-related toxicity. Three patients experienced carotid artery hemorrhage, two of whom had coexistent infection of the carotid artery.

645,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

854,"Comparison of single voxel brain MRS AT 3T and 7T using 32-channel head coils PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of three different regions of the human brain between 3 and 7 Tesla, using the same subjects and closely matched methodology at both field strengths., METHODS: A semi-LASER (sLASER) pulse sequence with TE 32ms was used to acquire metabolite spectrum along with the water reference at 3T and 7T using similar experimental parameters and hardware at both field strengths (n=4 per region and field). Spectra were analyzed in LCModel using a simulated basis set., RESULTS: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 7T was higher compared to 3T, and linewidths (in ppm) at both field strengths were comparable in ppm scale. Of the 13 metabolites reported in the paper, most metabolites were measured with higher precision at 7T in all three regions., CONCLUSION: The study confirms gains in SNR and measurement precision at 7T in all three representative brain regions using the sLASER pulse sequence coupled with a 32-channel phased-array head coil.
